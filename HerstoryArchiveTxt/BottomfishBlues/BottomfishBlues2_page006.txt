miles oh we White House is more  
likely to die in the first year of  
life than an infant born in  
Trinidad and Tobago or Costa Rica."

Throughout U.S. history the white  
women's movement has been inter-  
related to Afrikan-American oppression.  
We have been on both sides of  
this. We say we sympathize with  
Afrikan-American women and get  
enthusiastic over Gerry Ferraro  
("She's hot"). But to me Gerry is  
just the slumlord's wife, Goldilocks,  
fronting for one sleazy white  
man or the other. Just like "our"  
men, we want it all—the housing,  
the land, the few good jobs under  
equal opportunity, everything. So  
we look the other way when Donald  
and Crazy Ed and the boys create  
homelessness and reservations. After  
all, their homelessness is our new  
opportunity.  

The question for white women is  
are we going to take Afrikan-  
American women's housing and Puerto  
Rican women's housing, and take  
part in genocide? It's one way or  
the other. Whether to get up off  
the land, whether to give up that  
housing. A women's movement that is  
real about sisterhood has to be  
willing to fight white women who  
are loyal to a white men's world.  

We should support Herning Sunday  
and not Gerry.  

By SHEILA RULE  
Many black men and women are  
becoming increasingly convinced that  
they are not making the kind of gains in  
white-collar jobs that white women are.  

And that impression appears  
to be fueling  

as well as other disparities.  
Women often have more attractive  
educational credentials. There are  
more white women in the labor force,  
meaning a larger pool of candidates for promotion.  

Because of past patterns, white  
women have worked with companies.  
When companies promote from  
within, white women generally have  
more experience and seniority than  
blacks.  

Many blacks are psychologically  
hampered by a lack of faith in the fair-  
ness of the nation’s economic system.  
White women, on the other hand, tend

Laboratories, Kirsten

The tolerance expressed a general

showed that some employers had  
rationalized their failure to promote  
blacks with the argument that there  
were too few qualified black professionals.  
There was once a myth that black  
women were “twofers,” said George  
Davis, referring to the idea that corpo-  

Corporate Social Responsibility  

Homelessness is such a mild word,  
a much more neutral word than geno-  
cide. A people who are homeless will  
die, however. The ruling class has  
decided to get rid of these troublesome  
Black people, who can't be  
trusted as servants and who are no  
longer needed in factories. Afrikan-  
American labor is being replaced by  
even cheaper labor from Mexico, El  
Salvador, Haiti, and many other  
countries.  

Everyone is carefully taught to  
think of genocide as the Jewish hol-  
ocaust stereotype, millions getting  
herded into gas chambers all at once.  
But that's not how it usually  
happens.  

When the white colonial settlers  
on the east coast committed genocide  
against the eastern Indian nations  
it was a gradual, 100-year process  
(it took over a century just to get  
rid of the Indians who owned Brook-  
lyn). Step by step, acre by acre,
