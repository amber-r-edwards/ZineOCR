We ROT ZORA

Emma, West Germany's glossy lib-
eral-feminist monthly (much like
MS. magazine here), two Red Zora
women explain their underground:

"Q. Let's start with who you
are?

"A. ZORA 1: If this is a person-
al question, then we are women
between the ages of 20 and 51.
Some of us sell our labour, some
of us take what we need, and
others are 'parasites' on the
welfare state. Some have chil-
dren, some don't. Some women
are lesbians, others love men.
We buy in disgusting supermar-
kets, we live in ugly houses, we
like going for walks or to the
cinema, the theater, or the
disco. We have parties and cul-
tivate idleness. And of course
we live with the contradiction
that many things we want to do
can't be done spontaneously.

But after successful actions we
have great fun!

"Q. What does your name mean?
"A. ZORA 2: 'The Red Zora and
Her Gang' [a children's book]--
that is the wild street kid who
steals from the rich to give to
the poor. Until today it seems
a male privilege to build gangs
or to act outside the law. Yet
particularly because girls and
women are strangled by thousands
of personal and political chains
this should make us masses of
'bandits' fighting for our free-
dom, our dignity, and our human-
ity. Law and order are funda-
mentally against us, even if we
have hardly achieved any rights
and have to fight for them
daily. Radical women's strug-
gles and loyalty to the law--
there's no way they go together!

Hee HH HH :
"Q. How important is the con-
nection to the Third World, the
exploitation of women there, for
you?

"A. ZORA 1: In all our attacks
we've declared this relation-
ship, as when we attacked the
women traders and the Philip-
pine embassy last year [1983].

We don't struggle for women in
the Third World, instead we
struggle with them. For exam-
ple, against the exploitation of
women as a commodity. This
modern slave trade has its equi-
valent in the conjugal posses-
sion conditions here. The forms
of oppression are different but
they all have the same roots.
Nobody can play cards with us as
chips any longer.

"The separation between men
and women has its equivalent in-
ternationally in the separation
between people of the First and
Third World. We ourselves
profit from the international
division of labor. We want to
break our involvement with this
system, and understand our
common interests with women from
other countries."

its ultimate goal as the re-
placement of capitalism by a
communal society without strat-
ified economic classes and with-
out a patriarchal state. In
other words, a communist society

where all who do the work make
the decisions in common. This,
needless to say, is a far jump
from the choices women have
today--the imperialist non-
welfare state or patriarchal
socialism.

Red Zora doesn't believe in
hierarchical, left political par-
ties, either of the old Stalin-
ist model (which among other
things have always used women
and repressed women) or tame
models of middle-class legality,
such as West Germany's pro-white
ecology Green Party. They think
of themselves as part of a
revolutionary network sharing

GSC9 stormtroopers in raids on women's movement

The revolutionary feminist
guerrillas first came together
in 1974 during the women's
movement struggle for the aboli-
tion of the repressive patriar-
chal 'abortion law "Article 218",
and for the right of abortion on
demand. That campaign failed
like the defeat of ERA in
Amerikka. Even a modest re-
vision of the old law was
rejected by the West German
Supreme Court. The very next
day Red Zora women struck for
the first time, bombing the
Supreme Court building in
Karlsruhe.

Since then these sisters have
never stopped fighting to build
a women’s culture of resistance
to patriarchal imperialism. As
revolutionaries, Red Zora sees

and spreading:

"...the concept of building
illegal structures and a network
which is not controlled by the
state apparatus. This is so we
can carry out our subversive
direct actions. 'We strike
back!'--this slogan of the women
of May 1968 is no longer as con-
troversial today regarding indi-
vidual violence against women.
But it is still very controver-
sial--and most of the time taboo
--as an answer to the power con-
ditions that steadily produce
this violence against women...
Therefore, we think it abso-
lutely necessary to tear the
oppression of women as sexual
objects and as producers of
children out of hiding in the
'private domain,' and to show
our anger and hate with fire and
flames."
