When women complain that the U.S.  
government doesn't do enough for us,  
we should correct ourselves. For the  
U.S. government itself is the rapist,  
the torturer of women political  
prisoners, the world's biggest pimp,  
the enemy of women. The government  
is only a body of men supervising  
the violence against us. A few of  
the recent examples:

* William H. Russell, comptroller of  

the U.S. customs service, was barred  
from holding top-level federal em-  
ployment for two years. Russell was  
found guilty of physical attacks on  
women employees.

He karate-chopped his secretary  
from behind, on one occasion. A sec-  
ond woman subordinate was choked  
into speechlessness, and a third  
was kicked in the buttocks. Russell  
also tried to force one woman into  
sexual relations. In mitigating his  
punishment, the government board  
said that Russell had been lured on  
by his secretary's "apparent recep-  
tiveness" (it's always a woman's  
fault).

* Rev. Dames Ingely, husband of a U.S.  
diplomat stationed in London, was  
given diplomatic immunity by the  
State Department to avoid standing  
trial for "gross indecency" with a  
child. Ingely was flown back to  
Washington "for medical treatment"  
despite British protests. The story  
came out in January, and was the  
headline news in London.

* The U.S. Agriculture Department  
promoted Wayne Mayfield to deputy  
administrator of all farm price  
support programs. Mayfield had been  
the program administrator in Texas,  
but had been transferred after four  
women co-workers submitted sworn  
affidavits that he had been sexually  
harassing them. The whistle-blower  
who first charged Mayfield has been  
demoted. Mayfield is an associate  

of powerful Texas congressman Phil  
Gramm. At his promotion he was laud-  
ed by the department as "the most  
outstanding program individual in  

the United States." Outstanding as  
an abuser of women.

* John T. Keenan was acquitted last  
month of charges that he terrorized  
a white woman who has two Afrikan-  
American children. Keenan had been  
accused of leading a klan-ish cons-  
piracy to drive the family out of  
their Washington suburb by burning  

a cross in their front yard. The U.S.  
Justice Department Civil Rights Divi-  
sion, which prosecuted the case,  
tried Keenan for conspiracy, which  
by definition involves two or more  
persons, but charged or named no one  
but Keenan with participating. The  
jury noted this obvious flaw. Afri-  
kan-Americans in the area believe  

* The U.S. Army has set up a brothel  
area in Comayagua, Honduras, for its  
GIs and for the thousands of U.S.  
National Guardsmen who rotate thro-  
ugh the giant U.S. airbase at nearby  
Palmerola. The prostitutes are from  
poor peasant families, most of them  
refugees of the C.I.A. land grab in  
the area. The U.S. Defense Department  
is the world's largest pimp and  
whorehouse operator, running gover-  
nment prostitution service at bases  
around the world.

Macleans, the Canadian newsweekly,  
printed an account of a visit to the  
U.S. whorehouses in Honduras (U.S.  
Army military police tried to stop  
them from photographing the teenage  

prostitute in the U.S. flag halter):

THE COMFORTS OF 10 LEMP

At sundown ev-  
ery evening a convoy of  
buses from Palmerola  
disgorges U.S. soldiers  
into the muddy back  

streets of nearby Co-  

mayagua, an impover-  
ished town of tin-roofed  
shacks which now  
boasts a thriving zona  
roja, a red-light district.  
Dressed in jeans and T-  
shirts, forbidden to  
wear uniforms or talk  
about their duties, the  
GIs pick their way  
through the potholes to  
rows of hovels festooned  

with red and blue light  

bulbs, where the flower  
of Comayagua’s teenage  
womanhood awaits  
them.

Prostitution: In some  
narrow lanes where the  
rates are lowest—10  

lempiras, or about $7 a  

session—seasoned pros-  
titutes in miniskirts  
strut in front of door-  
ways draped with flow-  
ered curtains, winning  
the street its nickname,  
10 Lemp Alley.

The U.S. Army runs  
Comayagua’s red-light  
district as a virtual pro-  
tectorate, sending uni-  
formed military police-  
men to patrol at 15-  
minute intervals—  
although with orders  
not to interfere with  

business—and doctors  

to test the girls once a  
week for disease. But  
since El Tiempo charged  
that U.S. soldiers are re-  
sponsible for Honduras’s 20 known cases of  
AIDS (acquired immune  
deficiency syndrome), as  

well as a virulent East Asian strain of  
a less deadly venereal disease, the U.S.  
military has become sensitive about its  
supervisory role in Comayagua’s night  
life.

The U.S. Embassy now provides  
printed handouts refuting charges that  
the army has spread AIDS. And as the  
clients of the zona roja see it, the army  
is merely offering a necessary recre-  
ational service. Said one of Rosie’s  
clients—a 19-year-old Texan GI in a  
10-gallon hat who declined to give his  
name—“I guess you’ve got to get some  
affection somewhere.” The GI, on  
his first weekend pass out of the base since ar-  
riving on the Big Pin maneuvers in early  
January, added, “Besides, what else is there  
to do in this hole?”
