“Arabs, it's THEE the usssa. &

Israel are related white settler -

societies. Many, perhaps even a
majority, of the settlers seiz-
ing Palestinian land on the West
Bank are U.S. Jews. Some of
these settlers aren't even Jews,
just right-wing white men from
the U.S. who emigrate to Israel
for a chance to use their M-16s
and push around people of color.
You know, get revenge for ‘Nam.
Israel is "Settlerland," the
white man's ultimate amusement
park. The money to take Arab
land and put up their racist
settlements comes from the U.S.
Jewish community, from all those
charities Jewish women are al-
ways fundraising for.

In Jerusalem, U.S. Jews are
involved in a conspiracy to com-
pletely wipe out the Arab com-
munity--New York style. Piece
by piece, using Christian Arab
front-men, they are buying up
the entire Old City, the tradi-
tional Palestinian quarter in
Jerusalem. Where fraud and
arm-twisting don't work, Jews
are using fire-bombings of homes
and violent pogroms, where their
civilian street patrols beat up
and harass Palestinians, to ter-
rorize them into leaving. Fam-
iliar? Jewish feminists wanna
pretend to themselves that Jew-
ish culture is singing folksongs
and telling stories about their
grandmothers by the campfire.
No, this is the real Jewish cul-
ture now.

Spearheading the genocide
campaign in Jerusalem is the
Ateret Cohanim yeshiva, or Jew-
ish religious school, which is
associated with cabinet minister
Gen. Arik Sharon (who master-
minded the 1982 invasion of Leb-
anon). Avraham Shapira, the
Chief Rabbi of Israel, supports
Ateret Cohanim yeshiva's plan to
wipe out the Arab community. In
an open letter to U.S. Jews,
Chief Rabbi Shapira said that

the plan is a "sacred burden"
that all Jews must support, to

“restore the light on the Torah

to within the Old City of Jeru-

salem."

They have already taken 10%
of the Arab buildings of the Old
City, and the Ateret Cohanim re-
ligious school's public rela-
tions director (who is British)
boasts that soon enough no Arabs
will remain: "I think within ten
years we will have made Jerusa-
lem Jewish again forever." Not
to worry, each Palestinian woman
evicted will get a ticket to the
Bushwick women's shelter.

Ateret Cohanim's genocide
project gets its funding right
here, by the Jewish community in
New York and Florida (and gets
heavy bucks from some anti-sem-
itic Christian fundamentalists).
It even has an office here, on
Fifth Avenue at the Genesis
Foundation, which is licensed by
N.Y. state as a tax-exempt Jew-
ish religious charity. If you
were walking by the Hilton last
May 27th, you might have seen

hundreds of Jews in tuxedoes and
dresses pack an Ateret Cohanim

genocide fundraising dinner, at

$180 per plate, with the main
speaker being the Israeli U.N.
ambassador. This isn't some
Hasids or right-wing weirdo
fringe group, this is the main-
stream, what being Jewish is

now. Genocide is respectable as

long as you call it something
else. And when the most violent
settler gets heat over there, 
they just come back to their
rear-base area in Brooklyn for
R&R.

WHY IT'S AN ISSUE NOW:

The ruling class says "Black

anti-Semitism" is our problem,

but it's really their answer.

The more Palestinian teenagers

JERUSALEM, Jan. 14 — Two Pales-
tinian girls died today of head wounds
from Israeli gunfire, bringing to four
the number of Palestinian teenagers

who have been killed in the last 36
hours:

Palestinians and an Israeli Army
spokesman said Rana al-Masri, who
was 13 years old and from the West
Bank city of Nablus, died in Makassad
Hospital in East Jerusalem this morn-
ing. She had been shot in the head dur-
ing demonstrations in Nablus this
month.

Merchants called a general strike in
Nablus today in observance of the
girl’s death. In addition, six Palestin-
ians were wounded during demonstra-
tions in and around Bethlehem today.

The army also said 12-year-old
Hanadi Abu Sultan of the Shati refugee
center in the Gaza Strip died in a Tel
Aviv hospital today from a bullet
wound received during demonstrations
in the camp on Jan. 10. Doctors said she
had been hit in the forehead at close
range by one of the army’s new bullets,
a marble-sized steel ball with an
eighth-inch hard-rubber coating.

The bullets are now in general use
among many soldiers on patrol in the
occupied territories.

it's open hunting season on
"Willie Horton,” the more anger
and uprising there is after Gaza

the media tells us that “Black
anti-Semitism" is what we should

worry ourselves about.

Like all of a sudden it's a
big issue...but only because the
media and the Jewish patriarchy
says it is.

Who's being attacked anyway?
Are New Afrikan radicals target-
ing Jews for assassination? Or
attacking Jews on the streets
just for being Jews? Are New
Afrikans bombing temples and
driving Jews out of their
homes with firebombs? Are they
refusing to hire Jews except as
menial labor, as hewers of wood?
