pretty clear. It's also clear  
that white women mean for New  
Afrikan women to do the moving.  
We sure aren't moving to leave  
our nation. No, they gotta  
leave their people & come  
better themselves by moving to  
us. Gotta leave their oppressed  
nation (dis-integrate) & help  
strengthen our white nation  
(integrate). That’s what the  
racial crisis is now.  

Stripped of the false sen-  
timent and the dicky propagan-  
da, integration is a solution  
for political white women and  
a problem for New Afrikan  
women. No matter how loudly  
we deny it, we should know in  
our bones that what we say is  
sisterhood ain't nothing of  
the kind. Integration is an  
attack on New Afrikan sister-  
hood.  

Let's check integration  
now, after 20 years of pro-  
gress. In both spheres, both  
in the outside society and in  
the women's community. As a  
baseline definition, let me say  
that integration for us is the  
system that lets white women  
take what they need from Black  
women while helping them to die  
as a people. And the real ques-  
tion is, how can we as amazons  
get out of the genocide game?  

There were two incidents  
about integration last year  
that we need to break down,  
really learn from. One was the  
case of the seven New Afrikan  
women-children who attacked  
white women on Manhattan's in-  
tegrated Upper West Side. The  
other is the response to the  
Dianne Davidson controversy at  
last year's integrated Michigan  
Womyn's Music Festival. Both

Positions of Influence  

Women Are Liberating a Citadel of Male Power  

By BARBARA GAMAREKIAN  
| Special to The New York Times  

WASHINGTON, May 17 — This  
capital, which was traditionally a  
man's domain in matters of power  
and influence, is now a woman’s city,  
too.  

Women now head corporate offices,  
manage Federal agencies, run staff  
operations on Capitol Hill and operate  
as highly visible lawyers and lobby-  
ists.  

All this is happening despite an ini-  
tial lag on the part of the Reagan Ad-  
ministration in appointing women to  
top Federal jobs. According to the Of-  

fice of Personnel Management, the  
number of women holding Presiden-  
tial appointments dropped from 123 in  
1980 to 62 in 1981. But since then the  
number has risen sharply.  

Today, 227 women hold Presiden-  
tially appointed jobs, said Robert Tut-  
tle, director of Presidential person-  
nel. Among them is Mr. Tuttle's wife,  
Donna, who was named Deputy Sec-  
retary of Commerce this spring.  

68 ‘Historical Firsts’  

“What is unusual about this Admin-  
istration is that 68 of the appoint-  
ments were historical firsts," Mr.  

events became big problems for  
the white women concerned. Now  
the seven women-children are  
dismissed as messed-up poor  
kids whose mothers are fuckups,  
seen one you, seen em all.  
Who acted up & who will soon be  
on dope, on welfare, or on  
prison anyway.  

I think the case of the  
pinpricks says it all about in-  
tegration. Last November seven  
New Afrikan women-children,  
ages 12 to 15, were arrested  
for hit-and-run attacks using  
pins on at least 45 women, all  
of whom were white except for  
two Asians. For these few weeks  
there was mass panic on the  
Upper West Side, calls by white  
women for more police protec-  
tion, and stationing of extra  
police on each block in the  
area. Once they were arrested,  
though, white sisters breathed  
a sigh of relief & forgot about  

The children  
a city agency  
makes nomads  

By Nina Bernstein  
Twelve-year-old Tonisha stands on a  
trash-strewn sidewalk, her ogee shut tight  
against the gritty wind and her own tears.  

For months she has had no bed to call her  
own. Tonight she will have no bed at all.  

Abandoned as a toddler, sexually molested  
at 11, Tonisha belongs to no one but the City  
of New York — and the city’s Child Welfare  
Administration has made her part of its tribe  
of nomad children.  

There are hundreds of them, foster children  
shuttled nightly from one temporary  
placement to another in a forced march that  
leaves them chronically short of sleep, food  
and medical care, waiting for permanent  
placements that may never come.  

Their plight is not a secret. In September,  
1987, U.S. District Judge Mary Johnson Lowe  
ruled in a suit brought by the Legal Aid Soci-  
ety that the city’s then-makeshift practice of  
night-to-night placements violated the cons-  
titutional rights of these children, “for whom  
entering foster care has virtually meant joining  
the ranks of New York's homeless.  

But three years later, with the number of  
children in some form of foster care ap-  
proaching 50,000, the overnight treadmill is  
an even more systematic and nitrous  
of an expanding foster care machine,  

Greatly re-circulating those damaged  
children who haven’t been absorbed into  
available slots.  

In March alone, 534 children like Tonisha  
were subjected to the overnight system. One  
child was placed 25 different times that  
month. In all, 151 endured three or more  
placements in 30 days — 30 percent more  
than in July, 1986, when the first court hear-  
ings were held in the Legal Aid lawsuit.  
These numbers reflect the city’s failure to  
fulfill promises made in a tentative settle-  

Among the increasing number of influential women  
in the Washington business community are, from Rae F. Evans, vice president of national affairs for

them. And why not? Is it really  
news to white women that even  
the children of our colony hate  
us?  

"It isn't some mystery. It  
doesn't need a commission or a  
study," said Rakayyah Howell,  
who directs a local anti-truancy  
program. "The root of it is  
real simple. It's payback."  
PAYBACK, now there's an inter-  
esting idea on the horizon. In  
family court the woman judge,  
Leah Ruth Marks, delivered a  
racist diatribe to the girls  
before she found them guilty:  

“Even in this courtroom  
many of you reacted with joy to  
your victims’ descriptions of  
the pain and fear you drove  
into them as you stabbed them  
with your weapons...it seems to  
me that you took joy most of  
the time in harming women who  
appeared somewhat affluent, who
