In New York City, the capital of  
Babylon, AIDS has been let to run  
unchecked. For six years it has  
devastated the gay male community,  
while the government looked smugly  
on with folded arms and gleeful  
smirks. And for six years AIDS has  
silently moved in the Afrikan-  
American and Puerto Rican com-  
munities, laying the groundwork for  
mass deaths in the next five years.  
The government of white Amerikkka  
hid that knowledge while the  
disease took root.  

Now, everyone knows that white  
people think that there are too  
many Black people in the world,  
certainly too many in the U.S. and  
on the streets of its headquarters  
city. Just look around you. Whites  
are driving Afrikan-Americans into  
the streets and prisons, shrinking  
Black housing more every month by  
arson and gentrification. They are  
supposed to go away, leave, con-  
veniently disappear. They won't go?  
Then they should die.  

Whole blocks and neighborhoods  
are to be destroyed. City health  
commissioner Dr. Stephen C.  
Joseph finally admitted on January  
16, 1987, that the AIDS epidemic  
"will change everything about the  
city, its demography, the political  
and economic life of the city." It  

is believed that 500,000 people in  

NYC are already infected with  

AIDS. That's one out of every ten  
adults in the city. Long-range  
studies done in Europe predict  

that 50-70% of those infected will  
die within eight years. Some sci-  
entists believe that 100% of those  
infected will die. And the majority  
will be young Afrikan-Americans and  
Latins. Just who white people would  
love to get rid of. What a co-  
incidence.  

The NYC Afrikan-American commun-  
ity is the government's secret  
testing grounds, the death reser-  
vation, to observe the uncontrolled  
spread of AIDS. They wanted to

secretly test what danger AIDS  
could be to "innocent" straights.  
So for six years the government has  
shielded AIDS, making sure that  
nothing interfered with its silent  
progress into the Afrikan-American  
reservation. And if a few hundred  
thousand (or more) young Afrikan-  
Americans die "naturally", why the  
government thinks it's all the  
better.  

This won't be the first time that  
the Afrikan-American community has  
been the testing grounds in per-  
verted government "health" experi-  
ments. They did the same thing on  
a smaller scale in Macon County,  
Alabama in the infamous Tuskegee  
Syphilis Study, that they're doing  
now in New York. In that experiment  
431 Afrikan-American men with  
syphilis were kept untreated with-  
out their knowledge from 1932 to  
1972, so U.S. government doctors  
could see how they died. Of the 431  
Afrikan-American men, 107 died from  
syphilis and 250 died of related
