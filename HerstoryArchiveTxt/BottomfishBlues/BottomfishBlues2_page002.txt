‘KOCH’S SUCCESS

There is a careful effort by the
powers that be in NYC to put out the
idea that homelessness and joblessness
are the failure of the social
"welfare" system of the last twenty
years. THIS IS A LIE. The tens of
thousands of homeless are the
greatest success of the Koch admin-
istration and the ruling class.
WESTWAY WAS THE FAILURE. THE
MARTINIQUE IS THE SUCCESS.

It took twenty years to destroy a
major portion of the Afrikan-American
community, but they have finally
made serious headway. After the
urban rebellions of the 1960s the
handwriting was on the wall. Blacks
and Puerto Ricans have to go.
That's it—bottom line time. They
can't be trusted; they must be
dusted. Call it urban renewal, call
it civil rights, call it equal
opportunity, war on poverty, what-
ever. These folks gotta go.

Harlem sits on top of Manhattan
and was the seedbed of Afrikan-
American rebellion. So let's cut off
the head to kill the snake. Harlem
is to become white man's land.

Every year there is less and less
housing for poor Afrikan-Americans
and Latins. This is the plan, a
long-range plan by the white ruling
class and carried out by the Koch
administration. In 1974 the city
took over the Semiramis and in 1978

it took over the Lido, for instance.
Two large apartment buildings in
central Harlem, structurally sound
and overlooking the north end of
Central Park. Instead of fixing
them up for the homeless, the city
"warehoused" the two buildings for
