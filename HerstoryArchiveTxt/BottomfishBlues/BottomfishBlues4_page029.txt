anti-Semitism. What attracted  
so much interest was that it  
wasn't just Cokely, one man.  
Mayor Sawyer stalled around,  
didn't want to fire him. A num-  
ber of bourgy types came to  
Cokely's defense. Even Rev. B.  
Herbert Martin, chairman-desig-  
nate of the city commission on  
human relations, said that  
Cokely's words had "a ring of  
truth" although he personally  
didn't agree. Other politicians  
came to Cokely's support. Cas-  
settes of Cokely's speeches were  
being sold by his new employer,  
Louis Farrakhan's Nation of  
Islam.  

It was merely a play in plan-  
tation politics. Cokely was  
working for Chicago's Irish,  
Italian and Polish "ethnic"  
Catholic political machine, get-  
ting very well paid to confuse &  
abuse New Afrikans so that the  
local crackers could take back  
upfront control of city hall.  
Their real target wasn't Jews at  
all, but former reform mayor  
Harold Washington and the grass-  
roots movement he had tapped to  
become Chicago's first Black  
mayor.  

For fifty years, Chicago—  
called "the most segregated city  
in America" by the U.S. civil  
rights commission—had been run  
by the all-powerful democratic  
party "Machine." Under long-  
time mayor Richard J. Daley they  
ruled the city like a small  
apartheid state. Chicago's  
banks and corporations were  
tightly protected by a white  
united front that fused together  
the spine of local government.  

An Officer Sues  
Hasidic Patrol  
In Assault Case  

Says He Was Beaten as  
He Aided Elderly Man  

By DAVID E. PITT  
A 49-year-old officer in the New York  
City housing police filed a $2 million  
lawsuit yesterday against a Hasidic  
community patrol in Brooklyn and five  
of its members, who he said beat him  
and tried to take his service revolver  
when he went to the aid of an elderly  
man they were kicking and pummel-  
ing.  

The officer, Ganson M. Chambers,  
said the attack had left him partly dis-  
abled and unable to return to duty.  

Officer Chambers, who appeared at  
a news conference wearing a neck  
brace, said he was in uniform at the  
time of the Dec. 6 incident, at 206 Wil-  
son Street in the Williamsburg section.  

“I told them, ‘I’m a policeman,’” he  
said. “They said, ‘We’re the law around  
here.’”  

“At that point,” he said, “they  
started to kick and punch me,” adding  
that the plaintiffs had tried to wrest his  
service revolver from its holster. “I  
didn’t use the gun because there were  
too many innocent people around,” the  
officer said.  

Mr. Jordan suggested that “the  
powers that be”—including the Brook-  
lyn District Attorney’s office—had not  
acted with sufficient outrage or dis-  
patch in the case because of what he  
said was the political influence of the  
Hasidim.

the Catholic church, the mafia,  
and the white trade unions. New  
Afrikans couldn't set foot  
across the border into many  
white neighborhoods; it was How-  
ard Beach every day.  

In 1983, in a historic upset  
of the Machine, liberal con-  
gressman Harold Washington won

Teen Attacks Man Accused  
Sheriff Gondles  

Of Sexually Abusing Her  

A 17-year-old girl was arrested last night after she  
attacked a man who grabbed her buttocks and hit her  
in the face on a Manhattan subway train, police said.  

The teenager, whose name was not released be-  
cause of the nature of the crime against her, was  
charged with possession of a weapon, a razor, and  
possession of a toxic substance, a can of Mace, accord-  
ing to a transit police spokesman. She was released  
after being issued a desk appearance ticket.  

Eric Suarez, 22, of 1139 39th St., Sunset Park,  
Brooklyn, also was arrested and charged with two  
counts of assault and one count of sexual abuse in the  
third degree, the spokesman said.  

He said the girl and her mother were on a north-  
bound Lenox Avenue train that was pulling into the  
125th Street Station shortly before 6 p.m. when the  
suspect grabbed the teenager by the buttocks and  
punched her in the face.  

The girl’s mother tried to stop Suarez and she too  
was punched, the spokesman said.  

The daughter then pulled out the can of Mace and  
razor and slashed and sprayed Suarez, police said.  

Suarez required five stitches above one of his eye-  
brows and eight more near his chin, Valentino  
said. —T.J. Collins

Settles Suit  
On Harassment  

for $25,000  

Arlington Sheriff James A. Gon-  
dles Jr. said last night that he had  
settled a sex harassment suit  
against him for $25,000, and he  
apologized publicly for the first time  
for his part in condoning a “sexually  
harassing” office atmosphere.  

The lawsuit, filed in March 1987,  
in Arlington Circuit Court by Dep-  
uty Debora Mulvey, alleged that  
Gondles, who is 40 and married,  
asked Mulvey to have sex with him,  
harassed her when she refused his  
advances, withheld her annual pay  
increase for two months and unduly  
criticized her work.  

Sworn depositions taken in the  
case produced allegations from  
three former and current deputies  
that Gondles often bullied his top-  
level aides, told two of them that he  
had sex with female deputies and  
women who did business with his  
department, and made graphic sex-  
ual comments about other women.  

THE WASHINGTON POST APRIL 28, 1988  

come more a crusade than a mere  
election. Apartheid Chicago  
came into full daylight. When  
candidate Washington visited a  
white Catholic church one Sun-  
day, he was forced to leave by  
a hysterical mob of parishion-  
ers blessed by their priest.  
White Catholic cops began  
threatening and shoving around  
New Afrikans on the streets who  
wore Washington buttons. By  
election day wearing a Washing-  
ton button, or two or three, was  
a community duty, a mass defi-  
ance of the White Power.  

In Jesse Jackson's hometown,  
Harold had become much more  
popular than Jesse. In his  
election victory, many of the  
Machine's old-time Black poli-  
tical front-men were swept away.  
One of the Machine survivors,  
alderman Eugene Sawyer, hired a  
charismatic young man named  
Steve Cokely in 1985 to help  
him overcome his Uncle Tom  
image. Cokely began attacking  
mayor Harold Washington for be-  
ing a tool of the Jews. That  
was a vulnerable spot.  

Like Philadelphia's Wilson  
Goode, Atlanta's Andy Young and  
John Lewis, Los Angeles' Tom  
Bradley, and many other Black  
liberal politicians, Harold  
Washington had made an alliance  
with the Jewish community lead-  
ership. In return for campaign  
funds and other help, these lib-  
eral Black politicians commit  
themselves to the Jewish agenda—  
public support of Israel and no  
criticism of Jews for exploiting  
New Afrikans.  

In a humiliating display of  
lackey-ness this year, Philadel-  
phia's mayor Wilson Goode literal-  
ly had to dance for the Jews.
