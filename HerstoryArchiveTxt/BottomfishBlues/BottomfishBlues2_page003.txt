a decade. Now the city has sold them  
both to developers for a mere  
$35,000. The state is going to loan  
the developers $350,000 for engin-  
eering work, and the developers  
promise ‘Crazy Ed to condo the two  
buildings—/1 apartments for sale  

at $130,000 plus apiece. Not for  
homeless Afrikan-American women and  
children.  

The city has "warehoused" much of  
Harlem, consciously de-populating  
it. First the city let the banks  
(and the slumlords fronting for  
them) milk the community, extracting  
rents while letting the buildings  
deteriorate. Then came terroristic  
waves of arson for insurance (the  
cops turned their backs), and city  
bulldozing of whole blocks. It was  
like a bombing raid. The city now  
owns 60% of the housing left in  
Harlem. The more housing the gov-  
ernment controls the more homeless-  
ness there is.  

Their plan is for near-total  
Afrikan-American and Puerto Rican

Sex Harassment  
Survey  

sometime this month  

13,000 randomly selected  

federal workers will be  
asked to fill out confidential  
questionnaires asking if they  
have been subject to sexual  
harassment by bosses or  
coworkers.  

The survey, conducted by the  
Merit Systems Protection  
Board, is a follow-up to its 1980  
study in which 42 percent of  
the women responding said  
they had been touched, verbally  
abused or sexually assaulted by  

University urban planners Dr. Rich-  
ard Shaffer and Dr. Neil Smith say  
that re-settling Central Harlem as  
"yuppie Harlem" will require a  
household income of $50,000 per  
year to live there. Their study  
forecasts that the majority of the  
new Central Harlem's population will  
be white.  

AmeriKick has started pushing  
surplus Afrikan-Americans out. Out  
of houses, out of jobs, out of  
neighborhoods, out of doors. The  
Black land base is shrinking in the  
rural south, too. Just like the  
Indians before. It's only more  
dramatic in NYC, where thousands of  
street people roam the subways and  
Wall Street corners, rubbing up  
against "real people". It's going  
on everywhere.  

"Davis'" was the one Afrikan-  
American hangout for working people  
in Annapolis, Maryland's state  
capital. Now "Davis'" is a yuppie  
pub, still with the same name, where  
the governor dines and where Black  
people are not welcome. The Castro  

was a poor Afrikan-American and  
Latin neighborhood in central San  
Francisco. Fifteen years ago the  
government began helping gay white  
men to "redevelop" Afrikan-Americans  
and Latins out, as the Castro  

became a special community for gay  
white men, their small businesses  
and homes.  

And white women have been no  
different. Homelessness for Afrikan—  
American women is directly related  
to white women's search for equality  
with white men. In particular,  
young white women need housing—if  
you're going to be independent and  
not living with a man, then you need  
your own place. White women as well  
as men need more and more housing,  
and we damn well want it in Man-  
hattan or as close in as possible.  
All helping fuel the displacement of  
Afrikan-Americans and Latins. A  
yuppie (lesbian Professional)  
doesn't mean to harm or displace a  
fly, but she has an apartment in  
what used to be "Spanish Harlem".

Migration of Affluent Whites to Harlem Forecast!  

Two social scientists at Columbia  
University have detected signs that a  
process of gentrification has begun  
in the area, according to a 1982 city  
policy statement. The scientists note  
that the city, which owns more than  
60 percent of the housing stock in  
Harlem, plans to auction off 150 town  
houses there later this year.  

The report by the scientists, Dr. Rich-  
ard Shaffer, chairman of urban planning  
at Columbia, and Dr. Neil Smith, assistant  
professor of geography, was presented  
yesterday at the annual convention of the  
Association for the Advancement of  
Colored People.  

The city’s strategy, they said, calls  
for an emphasis on private investment  
in the area, which is particularly  
vulnerable to gentrification because of  
its low housing costs and its proximity  
to the two major employment centers in  
the city.  

The scientists concluded that potential  
renovators in a gentrified Harlem would  
need a household income of more than  
$50,000 a year to live there.  

In the last six years, the apartment  
building at 215 West 116th Street in  
Harlem has been sold five times, its  
price rising from $6,000 to more
