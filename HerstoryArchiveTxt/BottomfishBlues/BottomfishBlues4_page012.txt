who kill men in self-defense get  
arrested, get their quick "day  
in court," and go straight to  
jail without passing Go, un-  
known and unreported except to  
their families. Sharpton and  
Jesse aren't too interested, if  
you know what I mean.  

What that group of white fem-  
inists did was fine, something  
that needs to get done much  
more. But would they have done  
it if Karen Straw had killed a  
Jewish man on the street? No  
way! That's a different story.  
Every day New Afrikan women are  
the victims of Zionism in New  
York City. But white women look  
the other way, and really are  
supporting the Jewish patriarchy  
in its violent aggression.  

WAKING UP IN ISRAEL  

There's a whole white stereo-  
type that Jewish men aren't vio-  
lent. That they're schemers  
rather than fighters. It's an  
anti-Semitic macho put-down and  
cover-up all in one. Right now,  
Amerikkka has given Jews a free  
pass to go after New Afrikans  
and Palestinians. No one wants  
to say it, but it's real. When  
15-year-old Yarvilah Fulcher was  
beaten up in Brooklyn by a Jew-  
ish man, who punched and kicked  
her to the ground & knocked out  
one tooth and fractured others,  
the police refused to arrest  
him. Unarmed, Fulcher was de-  
fending her 8-year-old cousin  
from the man.  

Her mother was even told up-  
front by the cops: "It's not our  
policy to arrest Hasidic Jews.  
The last guy who arrested a Has-  
idic was walking a foot post in  
the South Bronx."  

It isn't a mistake, it's a  

Only a few years ago,  
remember, our mayor Crazy Ed  
told the public that in Crown  
Heights: Jews never used vio-  
lence. Koch said only Black  
people were attacking others.  
And the police had their orders  
to make it look that way.  

What's going on in Crown  

isn't unimportant, be-  
cause it's a pattern, a would-  
be Israel. Right-wing Jewish  
settlers, led by the Lubavitcher  
Hasidic religious cult, are try-  
ing to drive out all New Afrikans  
(who are 80% of the area's  
residents). They want "lebens-  
raum," depopulated space for  
their patriarchal tribe to ex-  
pand. They plan to take over a  
New Afrikan community, buy up  
the land bit by bit, set up  
white control of the streets  
(New Afrikans will have to show  
I.D. to white patrols to be per-  
mitted in the area), force Black  
families to become refugees once  
again, and remake the neighbor-  
hood into a segregated Jewish  
dictatorship. One New Afrikan  
woman, Emeline Nisbett, whose  
family has lived in their brown-  
stone for 38 years, says that  
Jewish men keep pressuring her  
to leave:  

"When we first moved here,  
there were both whites and  
blacks. Then the whites moved  
out and it was a nice middle-  
class black neighborhood. Then  
13 or 14 years ago, the Hasidics  
started moving in. Now, they  
just want us out... We allowed  
them in, thinking we could live  
together, and now they want the  
whole thing."  

Just like Israel itself, this  
little Zionism here is really a  
ruling class project, with the  
Jewish settler invasion protect-  
ed by the banks, city government  
and police. Last year, when  
Stacy Walton, a student at Wag-  
ner College, was attacked at  
night by a Jewish patrol, the  
City slapped them on the wrist  
for getting bad publicity.  
Brooklyn D.A. Liz Holtzman saw to  
it that the three Jewish set-  
tlers were only charged with  
misdemeanors, not felony char-  
ges. Despite having tried to  
murder the 19-year-old Walton.  

Religious students had their  
house firebombed at 1:30 am, af-  
ter refusing to move. Witnesses  
heard chants of “burn, burn,  
burn,” and saw two white men run  
from the house to the student  
dormitory.  

Just their final exam in  
Zionism 101. Police say they  
have no leads.  

“New Afrikan families who live  
near the cult headquarters on  
Eastern Parkway get harassing  
phone calls and false fire  
alarms. One Jewish man, seen by  
police placing a harassing tele-  
phone call to a Black physician,  
escaped into the Lubavitcher  

headquarters. Police chasing  

him were blocked and physically  
detained by a mob of over 50  
Jewish men. The police say that  
they have no leads and expect no  
arrests.  

Jews have threatened New Af-  
rikans living nearby that they  

Willie Mae Reddish with her son DeShaun outside her home in the Crown Heights section of Brooklyn:  

Only Moach Holzman, who led  
the patrol, was given jail time—  
a mere 60 days... Moishe Natik,  
who tried to kill Walton by  
chasing him down the sidewalk  
with his car, was only fined.  
Even that whitewash drew offi-  
cial protests from the Jewish  
leaders. Rabbi J.B. Spielman,  
head of the Crown Heights Jew-  
ish Community Council, said  
"Moach Holzman did not merit two  
months for a misdemeanor" -  
conveniently overlooking the at-  
tempted racist murder. Isn't  
that the job of patriarchal  
religion, to bless and justify  
their men's crimes of oppres-  
sion?  

In fact, the closer New Afri-  
kans are to the Jewish religious  
centers the more danger they're  
in. Willie Mae Reddish and her  
family, who live down the street  
from a dormitory for Jewish re-  

bust obey and not drive cars or  

run businesses on the Jewish  

Sabbath. Again, police and  
Brooklyn D.A. Liz Holtzman say  
that nothing can be done. A  
New Afrikan woman who lives  
across the street from the Jew-  
ish headquarters, Marie Des-  
roaches, who now gets harassed  
by Jewish men, summed it up:  
“They want us out because they  
want it for themselves, they  
want the Blacks out."  

I guess these Jewish men must  
be more our “sisters” than the  
New Afrikan women, 'cause we  
sure don't fight for the  
sisters.  

Patriarchal religion is all  

mixed up in this, giving an ide-  
ology to justify and organize  

Jewish men's crimes. Remember
