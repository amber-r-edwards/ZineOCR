“Scientific made it not one bit less  
‘powerful. Dr. Von Versucher's  

star pupil, a certain Dr. Joseph  
Mengele, became known as “the  
Angel of Death" at Auschwitz  
concentration camp, where he  
personally sorted out the ar-  
riving trainloads of prisoners  
as to who would live a little  
longer and who would "go to the  
gas" at once. As the death  
camps reached full capacity, a  
proud Dr. Von Versucher told  

the German people: “The politics  
of National Socialism [the name  
used by the Nazis] have finally  
put an end to the last threat to  
the race—that which comes from  
the Jews."  

Dr. Von Versucher was cleared  
after World War II by the U.S.  
military authorities despite his  
crimes against humanity, because  
our own country wanted his work  
to go on. Although Nazi science  
was slaughterhouse mumbo-jumbo,  
it was like Christopher Columbus'  
geography or the Pope's  
laws on sexuality. It was a  
primitive reaching for the  
socio-technological population  
control that capitalism has al-  
ways wanted.  

One small part of Nazi sci-  
ence involved the elaborate  
study of European Gypsies, a  
population small enough so that  
German researchers believed  
that they could make break-  
throughs by analyzing them in  
their entirety. So at Ausch-  
witz all Gypsies had their  
eyes removed after being killed,  
with thousands of bottles of  
preserved eyes piling up for  
study back at the Institute.  

This part of German bio-  
technology escaped public un-  
derstanding until the 1960s, so  
effective was the cover-up by the  
NATO Powers and Israel. Nazi  
researchers had believed that  
subtle biological characteris-  
tics would positively identify a  
person's "race" for the police.  

That's one reason Gypsy eye  

color was being studied. At  
Auschwitz, Dr. S. Erhardt of the  
Reich Section for Research on  
Race-Hygiene and Population Bio-  
logy, Department of Health, had  
systematically finger-printed  
all Gypsies. Her theory was  
that a tendency toward certain  
fingerprint or palm-print pat-  
terns could identify Gypsies and  
Jews who appeared “Aryan" or  
white. When Auschwitz fell, Dr.  
Erhardt managed to escape with  
her grisly research collection.  

In 1966, a respectable prof-  
essor at the University of Tu-  

bingen, Dr. Erhardt received a  

grant from the West German In-  
stitute for the Advancement of  
Science, to at last finish her  
Auschwitz fingerprint research  
in the "sub-human" peoples.  

But news of this grant prema-  
turely brought her to public  
attention, and protests by the  

Central Council of the Sinti  

and Roma Gypsies forced the  

West German government to seize  
Dr. Erhardt's genocide souvenir  
collection.  

The West German government  
was quietly going ahead with  
biological research—literally  
Nazi research—to be able to  
screen Gypsies and Jews from  
European whites. Whether it's  
even scientifically possible,  
the thing is that they want to  
do it. And we know why, too.  

The current director of the  
Institute, Dr. Widukind Lenz,  
assumed his post after Von Ver-  
sucher's death. Widukind Lenz  
is the son of Dr. Fritz Lenz,  
who was Von Versucher's boss in  
the Nazi science hierarchy.  
Lenz has sworn that neither he  
nor his father knew anything at  
all about the death camps—  
"that was all kept secret," he  
claims. Isn't that a familiar  
white story? Nobody knows any-  
thing about the genocide they  
did. It's all in the family.  

The West German feminist  
campaign against this bio-tech-  
nology has shown that Dr. Widu-  
kind Lenz and the Institute for  
Human Genetics are actually  
planning for mass sterilization  
of “anti-social" women, to re-  
duce and eventually eliminate  
unwanted sectors of the popula-  
tion. There the term “anti-  
social" is understood to mean  
the lower working-class, pri-  
marily Turkish and other Third  
World immigrants (and Gypsies,  
of course), just as the phrase  
“inner city" means New Afrikan  
and Latin here in the U.S.  

Those who say that mass  
sterilizations could never hap-  

pen, should recall that the  

Nazis carried out forced steri-  
lizations as a routine measure,  
against all “anti-social” ele-  
ments. Not only Gypsies, mental  
patients and the disabled, but  
also the mass sterilization in  
1937 of all Afrikan children  
then residing in Germany. To-  
day, Dr. Lenz says that new  

mass sterilizations would be a  
"eugenic solution," that is a  
biological improvement to the  
human race. Just what the Nazis  

said. Lenz argued:  

"We all know the anti-social  

areas on the edges of the bigger  

cities. Here, women have al-  
ready had seven or eight chil-  
dren before they are 30, even  
though economically things are  
bad for them and their strength  
is deteriorating; they are  
largely helpless in the face of  
childrearing problems. These  
mothers have children not just  
because they’re incapable of  
practicing birth control, but  
also because the family practic-  
ally lives from Family Allowance  
payments. In such a case I be-  
lieve that the solution of ster-  
ilization, suggested by the  
social situation, is at the same  
time a humane and eugenic  
solution."  

Revolutionary feminists  

fighting this bio-technology  
know that the horror of genocide  
didn't end in 1945—or 1963—but  
lives on in new and not-so-new  
imperialist programs. Red  
Zora's struggle against geno-  
cide of necessity includes the  
general defense of oppressed  
nationalities. Their work here  
is parallel to the Central Amer-  
ican Sanctuary movement, al-  
though much bolder in its view  
of the world.  

The two "RZ"s, Red Zora and  
the Revolutionary Cells, wage  
what they name the Open Borders  
campaign. Their concept of Open  

Borders essentially denies that  

West Germans "own" Germany.  

Open Borders asserts the sweep-  
ing right of all oppressed na-  
tionalities to freely move in  
any numbers into the developed  
nations of the metropolis, to  
demand jobs or adequate welfare  
as a right, and to be free to  
use West Germany and other op-  
pressor nations as bases to  
carry on their liberation acti-  
vities safe from deportation or  
police repression.  

After all, the "RZ"s say, it  
was the imperialists who broke  
down the borders by their cor-  
porate looting and support for  
death squad governments. It is  
only morally right, therefore,  
that Western Europe and North  
Amerikkka become open camp-  
grounds for the millions of  
Third World refugees we have  
created. And it's happening  
anyway, as they point out.  

Obnoxious officials, such as  
Harald Hollenberg, the Berlin  
chief of immigration police, who  
got his kicks from deporting  
Turkish revolutionary women back  
to the torture rooms of the  
Turkish security police, have  
been “knee-capped" (shot in the  
knees) or had their cars bombed.  
One, as a notice to their col-  
leagues to think before being so  
eager-beaver, but also to push  
West German women to resist and  
not go along with genocide once  

again.  

WOMEN'S POLITICS  

The natural question is why a  
Red Zora in West Germany but not  
here? There is not only the  
post-60s social bribery of white  
women by the patriarchy. In  
West Germany some women, perhaps  
only a few, have confronted the  
reality of genocide and we have  
not. Here we pacify ourselves  
that progress is coming bit by  
bit anyway, that we can't do  
anything because our truths are  
so unpopular.  

In West Germany, because of  
the heritage of Nazism, more  
women have admitted to them-  
selves both sides of the harsh  
truth: that under patriarchal  
imperialism the exploitation  
and genocide of "others" can be  
met with mass lack of interest  
and even approval; that nothing  
sanctifies our self-protective  
inaction. After all, for some-
