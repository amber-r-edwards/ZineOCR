watched “Amerika,” her husband watched the Miss U.S.A. Pageant in

the basement.

Nancy or Geraldine? Putting out for

woman land and woman culture we will

ABC filmed its maxi series in a
city called Chicago and a rural
Nebraska town named Tecumseh.
Indian names. Rivers, cities, coun-
ties, mountains, have Indian names

kick out the white invaders, and
who allied with the British in tak-

Indian name in use when the white
settlers arrived and they forgot to
get it straight with the Indians
before they killed them all.

White European men are the occu-
piers, the foreign invaders of
amerikkka. I mean the ones here now
who fear invasion and occupation.
Women, white euro-amerikkkan women,
who defend "my Man" are already
sleeping with the occupiers. It is
noteworthy that the most serious
competition for ratings that ABC's
"Amerika" had was with that all-time
amerikkkan rating getter the "Miss
America" contest. Dad was mentally
fondling women in the den while mom
