Victims of rape & other attacks at any time. Always calculating whether it's safe to wear this, walk there, or say that. That's normal to us. "Women" have no community, but live & work completely split up in men's community. That's normal to us. "Women" cannot decisively defend ourselves; either with fight or flight, unlike most beasts on the face of the earth. "Women" are not allowed territory, and by custom & law cannot patrol, curfew, or bar men out. That's all normal to us. What we think is not normal is being Amazons.

That's why I get so angry at the colonized fantasies of so many white middle-class feminists, that we should simply wish ourselves back to those ancient non-violent matriarchies or non-conflictual communal bands. That using Uzis or building a clandestine liberation culture is "playing men's game," is "using tools of the patriarchy."

Let me say it better so it really is in plain sight: If women could have nonviolently stopped genocide, they would have. Do you think that we’re so much smarter & tougher than those Afrikan women and Indian women? They did the very best they could, protected their sisters & children the best they knew how. Don't dismiss our sisters so lightly. Peaceful non-military societies cannot stand up to predatory societies. It didn't work the first time around, when our women's science & abilities were much more developed and our enemy was much weaker than he is today. And we, too, need the weapon of culture. And the weapon of war.
