Bourke-White, Margaret (1945) —-—
Victims of the Buchenwald concentration
camp.

One to have struggled against
the Nazi death system would have
meant not only building an “il-
legal" underground, not only
doing armed struggle, but also
challenging the disapproval of
most German women, who would
have called your acts treason.
And isn't that how it is now?

And here we are, still lying
to ourselves, still wanting to
be approved of, still paralyzed
because the things we know we
should do are absolutely for-
bidden by white male society.
Instead, we should be out
having a good time!

Complicity is something that
Red Zora women talk about, for
in their understanding, the pre-
vious women's movement made big
strides but reached a dead end:

"ZORA 2: For us, difficulties
start when feminist demands are
used to demand ‘equal rights‘
and recognition in this society.
We don't want women in men's
positions and reject women who
make their career inside the
patriarchal structure under the
guise of women's struggles.
Such careers remain an indivi-
dual act from which only some
privileged women can profit.
Women are only allowed to de-

sign and manage power in this
society if they advocate the
interests of men.

"ZORA 1: Of course, the
women's movement achieved a lot,
and for me the most important is
the development of a broad con-
sciousness about women's oppres-
sion in this society. Also,
women no longer experience their
oppression as an individual case
or think they themselves are re-
sponsible for it. Instead, women
come together and experience
their common strength... It was
an important first step to cre-
ate a public consciousness about
violence against women, but it
didn't lead to its prevention...
It is a tolerance which exposes
male parasitism. This ‘typical
situation’ is connected to the
fact that there is not much
resistance. Therefore we sabo-
tage, boycott, damage, and take
revenge for the experience of
violence and humiliation by

“attacking those who are

responsible.”

At the end of the interview,
the Red Zora women are asked
about the criticism that their
actions "scare away" straight
women from the movement:

"ZORA 2: Why doesn't it
have a ‘scare away‘ effect if a
guy sells women, but it does if
his car burns? Behind it is the
fact that traditional social
violence is accepted, whereas
similar reprisals ‘scare away’ a
Maybe it is scary if everyday
reality is questioned. Women
who get it pounded into their
heads from the time they are
little girls that they are vic-
tims get insecure if they are
confronted with the fact that
women are neither victims nor
peaceful. This is a provoca-
tion. Those women who experi-
ence their powerlessness with
rage can identify with our
actions. As every act of
violence against one woman cre-
ates an atmosphere of threat
against all women—our actions
contribute—even if they aim
only against the individual
responsible—to the development
of an atmosphere of ‘Resistance
is possible!’
