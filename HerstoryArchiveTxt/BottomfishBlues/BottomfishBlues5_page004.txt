took pride in their personal  
appearance, who seemed somewhat  
dignified and to have some pur-  
pose in life. If that woman  
also had long hair and was  
alone, your temptation to hurt  
her and ability to take joy in  
hurting her was irresistible."  

This was after the court—  

room had heard how the children  

were the truest victims. The  
oldest, a 15-year-old charged  
as the "ringleader" (every  
slave rebellion must have a  
"ringleader" in Master's eyes),  
grew up in the Holland, notorious  
as one of NY's most violent  
welfare hotels. Two of the  
women-children, sisters ages 12  
and 13, eat and sleep on a bare  
floor in part of their grand-  
mother's crowded apartment. The  
13-year-old had become the  
"mother" at age 7, cooking and  
caring for her four younger  
siblings. When cops broke into  
another place to arrest yet an-  
other of the children, they  
found her living involuntarily  
in a crack den:  

"The children were all  
alone in the dark, shaking,"  
recalled the woman who accom-  
panied the police into the  
apartment last year. "The four-  
year-old was trying to cook  
grits on a hot plate."  

Many of their parents were  
already dead, usually murdered,  
or in prison. These women-children,  
who have never known any  
other life than our present 20-  
year reign of equal rights &  
integration, are fighting best  
they can. I for one admire  
their courage.  

The meaning in Judge Marks'  
verbal abuse went beyond her  
casual racist assumptions: i.e.  
that "pride in personal appear-  
ance," "dignified," "somewhat  
affluent," & having "purpose in  
life" = WHITE. As she admits,  
the seven women-children didn't  
attack old bag ladies or poor  
Latinas or blue-collar white  
women—all of whom are on the  
street in the highly integrated  
Upper West Side.  

Their targets were those  
affluent white women of the  
affirmative-action generation.  
Precisely those upwardly-mobile  
professional & business white  
women who profited most from  
the struggles of the civil  
rights movement and the femin-  
ist movement. Who used those  
struggles to jump high up in  
Dick's empire. And what freaks  
those women out is precisely  
that their Upper West Side is  
so integrated. Because that's  
where college-educated young  
whites have integrated housing  
by driving Blacks and Puerto  
Ricans out of block after  
block, building after building.  
Integration is a one-way  
street, where Third World com-  
munities disintegrate and are  
absorbed piecemeal into the  
White Planet. It wasn't the  
white patriarchy which these  

Needles in Angry Hands  

Why 9 neglected girls terrorized the Upper West Side

pins against white women  

tapped the free-flowing fears  
of a city divided by race and haunted by  
AIDS.  

FOR A WEEK this fall, a band  
of black schoolgirls wielding  

Nightmare myths quickly grew  
around the racially selective attacks in  
one of the city’s most integrated neigh-  
borhoods on the Upper West Side of  
Manhattan. It was rumored that the at-  
tackers used AIDS-infected hypodermic  
needles to jab their victims, that they  
were female members of a violent gang  
dubbed the Decepticons, that they re-  
presented a dangerous new form of  
teenage “wilding.”  

The panic subsided with the Novem-  
ber arrest of nine girls aged 12 to 15.  

pins had been their weapons, police  
said, and they had carried out the un-  
provoked attacks on at least 45 women.  
The girls were released to their fam-  
ilies, ordered to Family Court on  
charges of assault as juvenile delin-  
quents and forgotten by the public.  

But a closer look at their lives reveals  
a larger story, perhaps as chilling in its  
truths and implications as any myth.  
Pieced together through dozens of in-  
terviews, including conversations with  
several of the girls, and with relatives,  
neighbors and officials, it’s a case study  
of throwaway children transformed  
into vengeful adolescents by a decade of  
public policy failure and family disinte-  
gration.  

“The society has sown these chil-  
dren, so now it’s reaping them,” said  
Rakayyah Howell, who directs anti-  
truancy activities for the Manhattan  
Valley Youth Outreach Program, a pri-  
vate, nonprofit social service agency  
that works with teenagers in upper  
Manhattan. “It isn’t some mystery. It  
doesn’t need a commission or a study.  
The root of it is real simple. It’s pay-  
back.”  

“We did it for fun, and it was fun,”  
one of those charged with assault in the  
attacks said in an extended interview  

The area along Broadway on the Upper West Side where many of the pin attacks occurred.  

earlier this month. A tall, heavyset girl  
of 13, she was apparently unrepentant  
on the eve of her second appearance on  
the case in Family Court. White women  
were targeted, she explained, smiling  
and shrugging, because “we knew they  
would be scared of us. They wouldn’t do  
nothing. We was laughing.”  

There was little laughter in this girl’s  
childhood. Born in Harlem to a 15-year-  
old unwed mother who quickly had five  
more children, she was responsible for  
cooking and most of the child care be-  
fore she was 7. “She was robbed of her  
childhood,” said the longtime compan-  

ion of the grandmother who eventually  

took over custody of the six children.  

In the months before the attacks, the  
18-year-old and her 12-year-old sister,  
also a participant, slept and ate on the  
floor of the grandmother’s West Har-  
lem apartment, because it has too few  
beds and no table for the 10 to 13 peo-  
ple living there. Neighbors called the  
city’s Department of Social Services  
last summer — to little effect — com-  
plaining that the girls were on the  
streets until the wee hours, sometimes  
with their year-old baby brother on one  
hip.  

Another girl arrested, a 14-year-old  
accused of sticking a pin in the eye of

conflict was  
but integration,  

and even the kids are saying  

what time it is.  

So after 20 years of inte-  

gration,  
down to:  

here's what it comes  
white women talk all  

this "sister" shit when they  
want "minority" preference in  
jobs, but have the cops out in  
force to protect them from even  
the women-children of New  

Afrika.  

These children were  

sentenced at birth to terror-  
ism, to chaos, and to early  

death,  

because our white em-  

pire no longer needs them  
alive & we're having a close-  
out sale on our ex-slave colo-  

ny.  

We hate & fear them,  

we've  

cleverly imported millions of  
Latinas and Asian women to re-  
place their labor so we don't  

have to do it, and now we want  
them to scatter and gradually  
die out just as the women of  
many Indian nations before  
them.  

For these women-children  
just being alive is the real  
crime, and we've found them  
guilty as charged. Why  
shouldn't they strike out at  
the people whose everything  
comes from their nothing? "It  
was only a natural thing that  
happened," said one 13-year-old  
of jabbing a white woman in the  
face. A 13-year-old girl.  
What's being born? Do you dare  
to name it? That's one reason  
we want a few Black women  
around us, to deflect the anger  
& to protect us from other  
Black women and children.
