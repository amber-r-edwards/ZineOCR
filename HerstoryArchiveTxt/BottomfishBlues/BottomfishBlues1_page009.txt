Male violence against children  
has become such an epidemic that  
it's a national scandal or a  
national sport. A 1985 Los Angeles  
Times survey estimated that some-  
where between 10 million and 17  
million U.S. men were sexually  
abusing children. Is that all? At  
one California mental health clinic  
447 of the women patients had been  
attacked as children. Killing those  
men should be our No. 1 mental  
health program.  

This cannot be an individual  
problem; it's the male structure of  
society. White feminists still want  
the police and courts to protect  
us; we beg and plead for men to be  
more “sensitive” to our oppression.  
What illusions the oppressed wear  
over their eyes. Aren't the police  
system and the courts and laws only  
there to protect the ruling class  
from those that they oppress? Who  
protected the 3-year-old daughter  
of Pelham, N.H. Police Chief  
William Collis, when he raped her?  
A male judge dismissed the charges,  
despite or because of the testimony  
of the mother and women social  
workers and child-abuse experts.  

And do you know why police and  
FBI can't identify those serial  
murderers of Afrikan-American  
women and children? Answer this:  
who can always get women into his  
car and return to the ————  
a suspect  

again without being  
batterers and police and judges  
and bureaucrats are the same  
people, not different people.

Now the war has been kicked into  
a whole new stage. Violence against  
women has always been here, of  
course, ever since the first class  
society was formed. The oppressors  
need violence to terrorize and hold  
down the oppressed. That's what  
lynching Afrikan-Americans was all  
about. Is all about. White women  
used to be "protected" by being the  
property of only one man, by living  
restricted lives by male permission  
of father or husband. Only one man  
at a time had the right to beat or  
rape or kill us. That's changed.  

: Ss more and —  
more personal independence from  
men; leaving the narrow household  
prison, leaving monogamy, being  
monetarily self-supporting, moving  
about the country at our own deci-  
sion, some leaving heterosexuality  
behind. Hey, now we're fair game  
for any man. Men figure we deserve  
it, bitches only trying to liberate  
ourselves. And for the most part  
they figure they can get away with  
it. That's what courts and police  
are there for.

Two men are being sought in the

The war against women is at a  
turning point. Because of our resis-  
tance against male attacks, our  
awakening consciousness, the ruling  
class has slammed new strategy into  
play. A campaign is running to man-  
euver us around while propagandizing  
men for new offensives. It's not  
only Hustler and Penthouse and "Deep  
Throat" now. The new propaganda  
offensive is being led by NBC, CBS,  
ABC, Time magazine, and other main-  
stream media. Farah Fawcett has  
gone from being one of "Charlie's  
Angels" to being the gritty rape  
victim who overpowers and ties up  
her attacker. Incest, rape, child  
prostitution, and battering are  
exploited for highly-promoted TV  
specials and magazine cover stories.  

This new "sensitivity” is very pop-  
ular with men. They love hearing  
every detail about raping children,  
kidnapping women right off the  
streets, and how easy it is to get  
away with it all. They're getting  
off on all this respectable porno-  
graphy under a "socially aware"  
brown wrapper. This is the way the  
TV networks and the mainstream media  
can get in on the porn profits while  
pretending that the system is gear-  
ing up to protect women from male  
violence.  

Porn publications have caught on,  
too, especially since they're  
getting criticism from the Right-  
wing. The January issue of Hustler  

works: "A COP REVEALS: SHOCKING SEX  
CRIMES". The article gives its male  
readers graphic accounts of rapes  
and murders, including one story of  
men who got away with raping,  
torturing, and disemboweling a 13  
year-old woman-child while they  
filmed the action. Details are  

given so that the sick readers don't  
miss a thing. That's what they need  
to get it up. This is supposed to  

be "socially aware" education, but  
only a fool wouldn't know what it  
really is.
