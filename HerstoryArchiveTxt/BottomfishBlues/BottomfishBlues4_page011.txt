THE RED, WHITE & BLUE OF  
“Black Anti-Semitism”  

"If you want to bet the horses  
and spend your dough,  
Don't come to me  
when they don't show.  
It's your red wagon,  
so just keep waggin'  
along..."  
Jimmy Witherspoon  

I wanna talk about the  
failure of white women—not only  
straight women but the women's  
movement, feminists, lesbians,  
all of us—to fight patriarchal  
genocide. That deep within the  
heart of our women's communities  
is the wish to be accepted by  
the patriarchal oppressor. The  
problem is the failure not of  
individual women, but of our  
women’s communities overall to  
oppose genocide. Which must  
mean that we're getting some-  
thing out of it all.  

Why can't we oppose Zionism  
or the extermination of the New  
Afrikan communities?  

Now we got a new thing to  
deal with. Something white men  
and the sisters of patriarchy  
say we should fear and tremble  
from. Some new ghostly diver-  
sion. It's called "Black anti-  
semitism." They say we should  
forget dealing with pro-Zionism  
in the women's community and the  
anti-semitism of white men.  

They say forget putting in check  
all those white women who demand  
to be called sisters while they  

support one or the other of the  

more vicious patriarchal states  

to erect in modern times. No,  
instead we should fear and focus  
on "Black anti-semitism," as if  

it weren't just another Amerikk-  
an plot to confuse and abuse.  

There are two or three dif-  
ferent questions about this lat-  
est & greatest. What is "Black  
anti-semitism"? Who practices  
it and just how real is it? Why  
is it an issue now, and who pro-  
claimed it a crisis? What  
should revolutionary women do  
about it?  

The key link in the talk of  
"Black anti-semitism" is putting  
down the New Afrikan nation as  
an army of racist anti-semites  
that Jews (i.e. us white  
people) should fear, just like  
the Israelis say the Palestin-  
ians are "beasts on two legs"  
(that's what they say) that must  
be crushed or all Jews will be  
wiped out. I.e. "The oppressed  
of the world are anti-semitic."  

It's the reverse of what's true.  
It isn't New Afrikan people who  
are the oppressors and racists,  
it's us. Jews are now part of  
the community of oppressor na-  
tions. It's true that for cen-  
turies Jews used to be op-  
pressed. The ruling class tries  
to use the image of the Jewish  
past as an oppressed people for  
its own white racist propaganda,  
to say that white people are  
victims of "racism" and to cover  
up today's genocide. That's  
what all this “Black anti-  
semitism propaganda is about.  

Really, it's the other way  
around. It's us who are doing  
the oppressing, and doing it not  
only in Gaza and Jerusalem, but  
New York also. Not on our own,  
no, but doing that genocide as  
the disposable pawns of euro-  
capitalism. And Jewish women  

haven't a clue as to what's hap-  

pened, or that surprise that  
might be waiting for us at the  
end of the tunnel.  

We're getting a mirror image.  

"Black anti-semitism" is part  
of a complex strategy by the  
euro-patriarchy. "Naturally,"  
we should all be saying, “it  
isn't what it appears to be.”  
Because the ruling class fights  
to control A Man's World not  
only with threats and violence,  
but with misdirection and mani-  
pulation. "Black anti-semitism"  
and Zionism are complementary  
parts of one strategy, of one  
system.  

If we don't see that, it's  
only because we really don't  
want to. White women still  
wanna be fooled, ‘cause that way  
we can avoid taking responsibi-  
lity for what we wanna go along  
with. Jane still wants to be  
Dick's favorite little sis, liv-  
ing in the suburbs of genocide.  

We have to start with the  
fact that white women can't deal  
with Zionism. Even the women's  
community and Jewish feminists  
can't oppose Israel or Jewish  
I was thinking  
about that after the Karen Straw  
trial. She's the New Afrikan  
sister who killed her husband in  
self-defense & won a big murder  
trial last year over Queens D.A.  
John Santucci. While Karen  
Straw saved her own life and,  
maybe her child's life, it was  
only white feminists who kept  
her out of prison. I mean, Bed-  
ford Hills is full of New Afri-  
kan women serving long sentences  
for killing a man in self-de-  
fense. Conviction is almost  
automatic, since it's doubly il-  
legal for New Afrikan women to  
defend themselves.  

What made Karen Straw's or-  
deal unusual is that a dozen  
white feminists, some of them  
Jewish, decided to use her case  
to dramatize the need for bat-  
tered women's services. Their  
impromptu group, the Battered  
Women's Defense Committee, pub-  
licized the injustice, raised  
funds at a celeb cocktail party  
for Karen Straw to have a law-  
yer, marched outside the Queens  
courthouse, and successfully got  
the newspapers to feature the  
trial. Most New Afrikan women

ARGES DELAY IN ARREST  

Black-beating probe  

to arrest Hasidic Jews. The  
commander of the Empire Blvd.  
stationhouse, allegedly pushed to  

HASIDIC SUSPECT  

Cary Seas Saat were  

Police yesterday reopened  
an investigation into the al-  
leged beating of a 15-year-old  
black girl by a Hasidic man in  
Crown Heights, Brooklyn.  

Ironically, the victim, Yar-  
vilah Fulcher, is an Orthodox  
Jew and a student in a spe-  
cial high school program at  
Yeshiva University.  

The girl's mother, Adinah  
Fulcher, said police initially  
declined to arrest her daugh-  
ter's alleged assailant, Avro-  
ham Greenburg, 27, by ex-  
plaining: “It is not our policy  

last guy who arrested a Ha-  
sidic is walking a foot post in  
the South Bronx.”  

The girl's father, Hashim  
Fulcher, a senior program  
analyst for Chase Manhattan  
Bank and one of the founders  
of Congregation Beth Elisha-  
ma David, a black synagogue  
in the neighborhood, said he  
called the police bias unit af-  
ter Sunday night's incident.  

“They wouldn't listen—I  
tried to tell them my daugh-  
ter was attacked because she  
was black,” he said.  

Capt. Jesse Peterman, com-  

stationhouse, denied police  
acted improperly. He said  
that because of the bias alle-  
gation he will “start all over  
again” and reinvestigate.  

He denied there is a policy  
against arresting Hasidim.  

Police said the incident  
grew out of an argument be-  
tween children playing ball  
shortly after 5 p.m. Sunday in  
the courtyard of 1650 Presi-  
dent St, where the Fulchers  
live.  

Fulcher’s cousin, Cecil Bai-  
ley, 8, who comes from a  
black Orthodox Jewish fam-  

the ground by Greenburg af-  
ter the cousin took a ball  
from Greenburg's 2-year-old  
son. When Yarvilah Fulcher  
came to her cousin's defense,  
Greenburg, of Cleveland, al-  
ready pushed and punched  
her.  

One of her teeth was  
knocked out and two others  
were fractured, her mother  
said. Emergency Medical  
Service medics confirmed  
she had a broken tooth.  

Yarvilah Fulcher is the  
granddaughter of Bill Tate,  
vice president of United Auto  

Workers District Council 65  
and chairman of the Bedford-  
Stuyvesant Restoration Corp.  

Said Tate last night, “What  
is wrong here is the double  
standard of justice applied at  
the 71st Precinct.”
