WAR AGAINST

"war, n. 1. open armed conflict
between nations or states... 3. any
state of violent opposition or
contest; act of opposition; inimical;
act or action; hostility;
strife; as, the war between the
sexes." Webster's New Twentieth
Century Dictionary

Where is our memorial? There is a
memorial in Washington, D.C. for
the 50,000 U.S. soldiers who died
invading Vietnam. But nowhere in
this land or any other is there a
memorial, no matter how small, to
the much greater numbers of women
who have been killed in men's war
against women.

We are at war, and male patriarchal
society is an enemy territory in
which we are raped, and murdered. Now women's
political awakening, our growing
resistance, has kicked men's war
against us into a new stage. The
government says that 4,000 women
are murdered each year in the U.S.,
30% by husbands and boyfriends and
almost 100% by men. This is not
the whole story.

WNBC's Rolanda Watts was told by
NY emergency room nurses that 20%
of women suicides were because they
were victims of repeated battering.
A study at Rutgers University
found that 50% of African-American
women suicides followed battering.

CYNTHIA A. BARROWS
... death called suspicious

50% of alcoholism in women was
linked to battering, and that
battering by men is the leading
single cause of injuries to women
(over car accidents, work injuries,
muggings).

There are the tens of thousands
of missing women and children, some
of whose bones are found by hikers
in remote areas. Aren't they the
real M.I.A.s? Not men invading
Southeast Asia, but women casualties
in the war right here. A missing
woman isn't worth a second thought
in America. Aren't you and I conditioned
not to think about them, also? There is mass murder going on,
silently.

Maybe that's why we don't have our
own army, because we've been conditioned
by the patriarchy not to see
this society as a war against women.
We don't see that we mourn our sons
but not our daughters. And where is
our army, our nation, our culture?
Men tell us there's no war, that
it's only a matter of individual
crimes or only family problems or
only psychological problems. 1.8
million women are battered each
year in the U.S. according to the
latest survey. At Boston City Hospital
72% of physical assault victims
are women who are raped each year, although the
usual figure quoted is that one out
of every seven women will be raped
in her lifetime. This, too, is an
underestimation.

A 1986 study of "date rape”
interviewed 6,000 women students on
32 college campuses: 7 had been
victims of rape and attempted rape
since age 14; 84% knew their
attacker. One Philadelphia student
"Renee," had been raped by her
professor. He was arrested on her
complaint and then arrested again
for raping another student, and
walked on both.

Skeleton Identified as Va. Woman Missing a Year

By Patricia Davis
Washington Post Staff Writer

Fairfax County police said yes-
terday that the human bones dis-
covered in a park this week are
those of 19-year-old Cynthia A.
Barrows, who was reported missing
more than a year ago.

The cause of death has not been
determined, said police spokesman
Warren Carmichael, but it has been
labeled suspicious. The medical ex-
aminer identified the bones with the
aid of Barrows’ dental records and
personal effects found in the park.

Barrows’ disappearance was re-
ported by her mother, Joanne Both-
well, on Feb. 19, 1986. When she
was told of the identification, “she
was very relieved that her long wait
was over,” Carmichael said.
Bothwell could not be reached for
comment yesterday. Her daughter
was last seen at a 7-Eleven at the
Bradlick Shopping Center, about six
miles from the park. Barrows’ light
green Volkswagen Rabbit, with her
purse and glasses inside, was
parked and locked outside the con-
venience store, Carmichael said.
Earlier that evening, Barrows, a
part-time waitress, had gone with a
group to a restaurant in Annandale
and then to a girlfriend’s house to
play Trivial Pursuit, police said. They
said Barrows left her friend’s house at
4 a.m. with two male friends, drove
her car to the store and entered a van
with one of the men.

Carmichael said the man told po-
lice he does not know what hap-
pened to Barrows, and that he
drove to his parents’ house and
slept in the van.

The bones and personal effects
were discovered Tuesday evening
scattered along a path in Beulah
Park, in the southern part of the
county, by a man walking home
from work, police said.
