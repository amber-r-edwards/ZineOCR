Killer Kops?

The dramatic arrest of Los  
Angeles Deputy Sheriff Rickey  
Ross as a serial killer of  
women followed by his quiet re-  
lease months later shows once  
again that today's women's move-  
ment has done zero to stop the  
slaughter of women. Cause we  
still got that call-a-cop when  
we're in deep shit. Just plain  
sisterhood ain't proved to be  
that powerful. Men continue to  
harvest women at their pleasure,  
whenever they feel like it.

What some feminists who deal  
with these serial killer cases  
think is that police are often  
the serial murderers themselves.  
And that their police supervi-  
sors do the cover-up, the minimi-  
zing of women's deaths. Since  
it's their job to step on the  
Oppressed anyway, cops are  
naturals when it comes to per-  
sonal violence against the peo-  
ple they have been put in charge  
of keeping down. Getting their  
rocks off by shooting and beat-  
ing and raping isn't too dif-  
ferent than their work-a-day  
world. (Which doesn't stop  
women from hanging out with them  
and begging them for protec-  
tion.)

Most of the serial murder  
cases are of women that society  
has defined as "loose." New Af-  
rikan women, Latinas, addicts,  
prostitutes, young runaways, or  
male homosexuals. From their  
own experience police know that  
amerikkka wants the “loose  
women to die.

Deputy Rickey Ross, 40, is a  
veteran narcotics investigator  
for the L.A. County Sheriff's  
Department. Ross was arrested  
while driving intoxicated—at-  
tempting to evade police ques-  
tioning at 1:30 a.m., Feb. 23,  
1989. In the unmarked county  
car was a frightened prosti-  
tute. They had gotten off on  
coke together, but the woman,  
knowing that a serial killer was  
working the streets got scared  
when Ross said he wanted to get  
something out of the car trunk.

In the trunk police found two  
unregistered pistols; one that  
ballistics later identified as  
the murder weapon in the kill-  
ings of three New Afrikan women:  
Judith Simpson, 27, found Oct.  
14, 1988; Cynthia Walker, 35,  
found Nov. 8, 1988; and Latanya  
Johnson, 24, found Dec. 11,  
1988.

Even on the day he was arres-  
ted, his sheriff friends were  
privately telling reporters that  
the charges would be dropped  
later on the grounds that the  
L.A. police ballistics tests  
were inconclusive.

Prosecutors (and the L.A.  
police dept. which is competi-  
tive with the L.A. sheriff's  
office) laughed at this rumor.  
But 3 months later in May  
that's what happened. Deputy  
Ross was quietly released and  
charges were dropped. LAPD says  
he's still a suspect but that  
they have no evidence against  
him.

Looks like Deputy Ross is off  
scot-free.

Margaret Prescod of LA's  
Black Coalition Fighting Back  
Serial Murders is furious that  
LAPD Chief Daryl Gates now con-  
fesses that the department  
wouldn't accept the possibility  
that a cop was a serial killer.  
Prescod says that her group had  
tried to pass on information  
from street women who had gotten  
away and who believed that their  
attempted killer was a cop of  
some kind: "We did try to bring  
the information forward through  
the proper channels. It just  
didn't get very far."

While Ross is a suspect in 12  
recent killings of women, police  
do not believe that he did them  
all. Composite portraits of two  
men—one black and one white—  
are being shown to street women  
by police.

Asked whether any other sus-  
pects were sheriff's deputies,  
District Attorney Sterling Nor-  
ris responded, "I can't say."

Serial killings blur into  
each other, no longer unusual.

AMERIKKKA'S CRAPITOL

The five officially unsolved  
Suitland serial murders in Wash-  
ington, D.C. are really closed  
now. It's accepted that they  
were done by Alonzo Best, 32, a  
U.S. Park Service groundskeeper  
serving an 18 1/3 years to life  
sentence for a sixth rape mur-  
der. But after Best was arrest-  
ed for killing Janice Morton,  
20, on Jan. 14, 1987, specula-  
tion began not only about the  
five Suitland serial murders but  
also about the role of Best's  
nephew, D.C. police officer Wil-  
liam A. Armah. And a possible po-  
lice cover-up.

The six murders were similar  
in location, method and who the  
victims were. All the women  
were New Afrikans, from 5'1" to  
5'3" in height, in their 20s,  
who used drugs and hung out at  
the same clubs, and were either  
strangled or stabbed and sexual-  
ly assaulted. The first five  
bodies were found in December  
1986 and January 1987, in an  
overgrown wooded area in Suit-  
land just across the D.C. city  
line. The five were: Dorothy  
Ann Miller, 22; Juanita Marie  
Walls, 26; Pamela Marcia Mal-  
colm, 25; Angela Maria Wilker-  
son, 22; and Cynthia Lee West-

Alonzo Best had used police  
officer Armah's black van for  
the sixth killing after a night  
of partying. His frenzied beat-  
ing of pregnant Janice Morton  
all over her body before he  
strangled her was so bad that he  
broke his own wrist.

Sheriff's Deputy Held  
In Prostitute Killings

Gun Found.  
Linked to 3!  
in South-Central

and TRACY W.  
Times Staff Writers  
A veteran Los  
Angeles sheriff's narcotics  

Deputy Rickey Ross  
has been with the Sheriff’s  
Department for 18 years, was  
arrested with a prostitute in an unmarked  
car near the Harbor  
Gage Avenue at 1:30 a.m.  
yesterday, Los Angeles 5  

Deputy Rickey Ross  
at a news conference said,  
“has been used in three murders of  
women involved in prostitution.”

Alonzo Best had used police  
officer Armah's black van for  
the sixth killing after a night  
of partying. His frenzied beat-  
ing of pregnant Janice Morton  
all over her body before he  
strangled her was so bad that he  
broke his own wrist.

The same day, both Best and Armah  
tried to clean up Janice Mor-  
ton's blood from where it had  
splashed all over the inside of  
Armah's van. The van was found  
a week later hidden away in a  
repair shop, blood and hair  
still inside it.

Witnesses had seen a black  
van dump Janice Morton's beaten  
body in a D.C. alley, and police  
set up roadblocks stopping all  
black vans. Armah was with Best  
in the van when it was stopped  
by Prince George County police.  
Armah simply flashed his badge  
and he and Best were allowed to  
leave without the blood-splattered  
van being searched.

Armah said after his uncle's  
arrest that he had just loaned  
him the van, thought the blood  
came from some injured man, and  
didn't take part in the rape-  
murders. A D.C. police investi-  
gation cleared him and restored  
him to duty. Both men deny  
doing the first five sex mur-  
ders. This in the face of the  
fact that Best knew at least 3  
of the women and police say a  
witness placed one of the five  
in a black van like Armah's.

This might fly a little better  
if Best hadn't been arrested  
in 1981 for attacking two women.  
Arrested after kidnapping two  
New Afrikan women that he tied  
up and stuffed in Armah's van  
(yes, that very same black van).  
Best was driving out to Suit-  
land! If the two sisters hadn't  
escaped out the rear door of the
