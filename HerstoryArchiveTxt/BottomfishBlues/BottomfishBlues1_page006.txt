share their scarce needles. The  
government has refused to fund  
enough drug abuse programs (to  
say nothing of what causes  
drug use). Half of all addicts  
in the city are now believed  
to have the AIDS virus. Most  
or all will die. As will many  
of their sex partners, and  
these peoples’ subsequent sex  
partners.  

What can you do if you find  
out that, although you feel fine,  
you have the AIDS virus? Here's  
catch-22. Medical advice is that the  
more positive your general health  
the better your chance of not gett-  
ing the disease. So doctors advise  
being in a good mood, to eat a nu-  
tritious diet, avoid drugs, smoking  
and alcohol, and get the right am-  
ounts of rest and exercise.  

How you're supposed to do that on  
food stamps, or while coping with  
kids in a welfare hotel, or while  
there's no money in your pocket, is  
up to you. AIDS and the oppressed  
were tailor-made for each other.

with their young children. 80% of  
these children are Afrikan-American  
and Latin.  

What's really going on is Black  
genocide, that AIDS is being used as  
just one part of a larger white  
Babylonian conspiracy. Mayor Koch,  
for instance, would obviously love  
to get rid of poor Afrikan-Americans  
any way he can. He is emptying Har-

homeless off Manhattan's expensive  
streets, make Black people just go  
away like the Indians, make them  
disappear everywhere from his apart-—  
heid real estate dreams. Is it a co-  
incidence that his “health” dept.  
has done everything possible to  
spread AIDS among Afrikan-Americans  
short of tying folks down and in-  
jecting them? Is it a coincidence  
that Dr. David Sencer, who was CDC  
director and in charge of the Tus-  
kegee coverup operation, was brought  
to NYC to oversee this city's AIDS  
non-program? Or that once again a  
government "health" program has  
been mainly concerned with denying  
Afrikan-Americans knowledge and  

The number of women with AIDS is  
rising, and researchers now admit  
that because women show a different  
pattern of symptoms (we tend not  
to get skin cancers but do tend to  
die quickly) we are often not diag-  
nosed. AIDS is al-

NYC for women ages 25 to 29, and the  
second leading cause in women ages  
30-34. On a national basis 51% of  
women with AIDS are Afrikan-American  
and 22% are Latinas. Relatively few  
white middle-class women are affect-  
ed, and very few white middle-class  
lesbians. This has led many white  
feminists to consider AIDS a "boys"  
problem. As if sisterhood is spell-

And once again the invisibility  
of Afrikan-American women is at the  
center of the coverup. We should

a man assaulted another girl inside  
the house, county police reported.  

Police were unsure last night  
whether the discovery of the body  
and the assault were related.  

At 4:50 p.m., two boys walking  
about 100 yards behind the Cutler

The girl appeared to be between  
12 and 14 years old, according to  
police.
