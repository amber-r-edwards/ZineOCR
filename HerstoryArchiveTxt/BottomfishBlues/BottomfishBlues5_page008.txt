High AIDS Rate Among New Moms

One of every 77 in the city
infected with deadly virus

By Laurie Garrett

One of every 77 women who gave
birth in New York City last year was
infected with the AIDS virus, according
to a state Health Department study
published today.

Statewide, one of every 150 women
was infected, says the report appearing
in today’s Journal of the American
Medical Association.

“I do think this documents what
many have suspected, that we have
substantial rates of infection among
women and newborns,” said the lead
author, Dr. Lloyd Novick of the Health
Department. The results parallel a pre-
liminary report in July, based on six
months of the study.

The study analyzed blood samples
from all babies born in hospitals, as
well as demographic information, but
not the names of the mothers: In the
year beginning November, 1987,
276,609 blood samples were collected.

During that period, 1,816 babies car-
ried the AIDS virus antibodies, indicat-
ing their mothers may have passed on
the infection during pregnancy. Using

data among intravenous drug users, said
epidemiologist Nancy Padian of San
Francisco General Hospital. “And to
my knowledge,” she added in an inter-
view, “there really isn’t any good data
on the number of women who got HIV
[the AIDS virus] as a result of sexual
exposure alone.”

Padian said the state’s conclusion
that one out of every 150 women in New
York is infected is a bit misleading be-
cause the infections are clearly concen-
trated in a few city neighborhoods. In 33
neighborhoods — including Harlem,
East Harlem, the South Bronx, East
Flatbush, Bedford-Stuyvesant and Ja-
maica — the infection rates are two to
four times higher than the city average
of 1.14 percent of women of childbear-
ing age.

“It’s very important to understand,”
said Padian, “that the bulk of the prob-
lem is found in little

This “pocketing” of the epidemic
makes the public health effort more
manageable, said Novick, because
AIDS education can be targeted at
women in those areas.

living in a women-only environ-
ment. There's an attitude that
"their" job is to entertain us,
but otherwise we want "them" to
shut the fuck up. We got "them"
outnumbered so it's all ours.
Our racism is edging more &
more out there, as Dick's gen-
ocide gains momentum and all
white folks get more cocky.
Many white sisters feel they
don't even have to pretend to
care anymore.

What I'm saying is that
it's not Dianne Davidson who's
the outsider. That her view,
her integration with her very
own New Afrikan woman, is rep-
resentative of something very
deep in our community & in our
"women's culture." Sure, Dianne
Davidson loves her New Afrikan
servant woman—why shouldn't
she? Her "mammy" cooked her
food & washed up after her,
cleaned her clothes, took care
of her, taught her & kept her
company. One way all the way.
Why shouldn't she love that?
That's why lots of white
Southern men, from Robert E.
Lee to Buford Bigot, have al-
ways gone on how they love
their "mammy." And they all
say they're not racists, too.
Dianne Davidson boasts how
she's a daring non-conformist,
a "rule-breaker" as she puts
it. White women have bought in-
to this image because it flat-
ters themselves, but Davidson's
beliefs are as "nonconformist"
as the confederate flag.

New Afrikan sisters have
been pointing out this "black
mammy" shit to white feminists
for...oh, about 150 years or so
now. Maybe we should have a
centennial celebration, at
least. Every year they have to
start all over, repeat it
again. Somehow, someway, white
women with college degrees and

PhDs, who run Olivia Records,
can't remember this basic
thing. NOW, in 1990 (after over
20 years of integration) it's

still a controversy to us—maybe
"Black mammies" are good,

maybe it's bad, we don't know.

"Course, what it is, is we

don't care. Dianne Davidson

isn't anything special—she's
our cultural representative.
Because in our culture, New Afrikan
women are an appliance to
us, our feminist property to
improve our lives, to entertain
us & support our community, to
make it even easier to be
white. Hey, what happens to

them and their real children we

don't care—they can go die un-
less we need them for some
reason.

It's kinda dialectical. I

mean, who needs to integrate?

White sisters like to say, we
love to say, we have so much to
offer (politics, resources)
while Black women have so
little. Without our help
they're powerless. But, lady,
white women ain't got nothing
yet of our own to give. Nothing
but money. Nothing but some-
thing we're dependent on white
men's power for. Better believe
it.

It isn't Black women who
need white women's resources,
it's white women who need Black
women's resources. That's why,
without ever posing it as a
conscious decision, white women
have almost universally chosen
not to form white women's
groups to fight racism in our
community, but took up urging
integration on Black women as
a substitute.

Twenty years ago at the
start of the modern women's
movement, this situation

existed: There was a struggle
for Black Power & independence.
There was a struggle for Sis-
terhood, with sisterhood being
defined as all women. Our poli-
tics were taken muchly from the
Black movement, at least many
key ideas—separatism, con-
sciousness-raising, and identi-
fication with the oppressed on
a world scale. Although the
situation in the Black movement
was very reactionary in terms
of women, there was a general
symmetry between political —
Black men and political white
women that New Afrikan women
should be integrated into both
of these movements. And
throughout the 20 years, New
Afrikan women have remained
marginalized inside both move-
ments that claim them as prop-
erty (it's your typical joint
custody fight). New Afrikan
women have strongly resisted
inside both movements. Many
refuse to deal much with

either movement and are
searching for better answers.

White women needed New Af-
rikan women in a big way. Need
to steal their politics & cul-
ture, need them as front women,
need to colorize the white
women's movement. Need to dis-
guise the lack of serious poli-
tics among white women. The
situation is the same today.

It's white women, as the
largest and best-educated and
best-connected “minority" in
the affirmative-action scam,
that have profited most in new
careers, promotions, business
ventures, property ownership,
and upward stepping mobility.
Dick grumbles at having to
share anything from his plate,
but he needs us to help him
keep the loot within the Great
White family. It would be hard
