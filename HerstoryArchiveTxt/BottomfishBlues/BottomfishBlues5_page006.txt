‘The Anti-Racist Initiative Is Long Overdue’

By Ginny Z. Berson  
and Achy Obejas  

It was at this summer’s Michigan  
Womyn's Music Festival that Chicagoan  
Jill Burgin and about 500 other women  
made a personal commitment to return  
to their home communities and  
“interrupt” racism.  

At the festival’s first-ever Town  
Meeting on anti-racism work, Burgin  
and the others heard the usual  

complaints about the festival's insen-  
sitivities. Also compiled at the Saturday  
morning meeting was a long list of  
suggestions on how the fest could do  
better.  

But perhaps more importantly, work-  
shop facilitators proposed anti-racism  
strategies and encouraged women of all  
colors to take responsibility—to speak  
up and take action when they saw  
racism being practiced.  

“I had always been concerned and  
frustrated by racism,” said Burgin. “I  
came back from Michigan thinking that  
we do a good game of talking, but we  
really have to get out there and do  
something about it.”  

Burgin, Joy Walker, Helen Pytlewicz,  
Janine Hoft, Ann McCallister, Laura  
McAlpine, and Dee Henn—all white  
women concerned about racism—  
banded together to form Chicago  
Lesbians Emerging Against Racism  
(CLEAR), which has organized its first  
event: a boycott of Dianne Davidson's  
new album.  

This year, the anti-racist work  
began as the first women arrived on the  
land, weeks before the actual festival.  
The “official” worker packet—which  
usually consists of a welcome letter from  
producers Lisa Vogel and Boo Price,  
maps, rules and procedures, forms and  
the like—also included a four-page  
document, “Anti-Racism: I am,” written by long  
time workers Blanche and others.  

Dianne Davidson did not return  
Windy City Times’ phone calls.  
“She and I talked about all this, of  
course,” said Burgin. “I know  
she didn’t say anything at all. But  
like she thinks it's okay that there  
was slavery.”  

Jill Burgin said CLEAR was  
everything to give Dianne  
a chance to explain what  
she didn’t really know at first.  
“To her credit, she apologized,”  
Burgin said. “It was a matter of  
familiarity and acknowledgment.”  

Davidson’s October 28 concert at Mountain Moving  
was followed by an anti-racist  
discussion that led to some real understanding  
amongst all the sisters involved. Things didn't end with  
the usual dismissive mea culpa.  

The idea of white women  
acting for ourselves, in our  
own name, not hiding behind  
Third World women & men as we  
usually do on this subject, is  
so positive because it gives us  
another choice to what has be-  
come the dishonest soap opera  
of integration among us. It  
helped some white sisters take  
responsibility that is really  
ours, while letting Third World  
sisters be free to take part &  
relate in the ways & degrees  
that fit their own agenda.  

Burgin really came out in the Windy  
City Times story:  

"'Traditionally, it's al-  
ways put to women of color to  
explain racism,' said Burgin.  
'We decided that had to  
change.'  

"'Most of the sisters I  
know don't even know she's on  
the planet," said Donna Weems,  
president of the Literary Ex-  
change and an activist in the  
Black lesbian community, by way  
of explaining why there's been  
no clamor about Davidson among  
Black lesbians. 'But this bus-  
iness of white women taking the  
initiative on anti-racist work  
is long overdue. I was heart-  
ened to hear this.'  

"'I think it's very good  
when white women try to raise  
their own consciousness about  
racism,' said Carmen Aguilar, a  
member of Latina Lesbians En  
Nuestro Ambiente (LLENA). 'Of  
course, we too need to help  
frame certain issues so that  
they have an understanding.  
Besides, it's important we all  
be involved in order to have a  
real sense of community.'"  

To me the focus isn't Da-  
vidson. And it's wrong to make  
her out to be some one-woman  
epidemic of racism. It ain't  
about her. It's about what the  
response to her in our communi-  
ty reveals. All along, most  
women in the community have  
considered these attitudes to  
be acceptable. That's the main  
thing. Even after her racism  
was out of the closet in the  
Sojourner interview & the con-  
troversy was on, the Michigan  
Womyn's Music Festival still  
thought it okay for her to per-  
form. No problem. And even  
after the protest from Festi-  
val workers—and her refusal  
to admit anything wrong—fem-  
inist coffeehouses and con-  
certgoers still thought her okay.  
No problem.  

It's only because the women  
she steps on are New Afrikan  
that we think it's okay. If a  
visiting white South African  
singer had popped up at Michi-  
gan to say how nice it was that  
her Afrikan servant from Soweto  
loved her, and if one Afrikan  
sister in the audience had pro-  
tested, Ms. Boer would have  
been sent flying. Instant apol-  
ogies all around. But New Afri-  
kan women, ah, that's different  
to us somehow. That's what the  
Davidson controversy revealed.  

The ugliest thing at Michi-  
gan by far was the booing that  
greeted the Festival Workers  
Statement: (mixed in with cheers  
and applause). It was good that  
so many sisters came to the  
Town Meeting about fighting ra-  
cism, but the vast majority  
chose not to take part. Aren't  
we reaching a nodal point,  
where even the routine pretense  
of sisterhood is coming apart?  
Among us as in the larger soci-  
ety. When we don't care to fake  
it anymore? Lots of us were  
shocked that sisters would boo  
an anti-racist statement, or  
that Alix Dobkin (who read it &  
is one of the most respected  
white musicians in the women's  
community) would be booed by  
women. But I think it was good,  
it got folks' real loyalties  
out there. It was an honest ex-  
pression of integration among  
white lesbians and feminists.  

FACT: Hundreds of white  
women were pissed that Third  
World and white sisters angry  
about racism against New Af-  
rikan women were taking up  
time in our once a year les-  
bian vacation, when we wanna  
celebrate the sheer freedom of
