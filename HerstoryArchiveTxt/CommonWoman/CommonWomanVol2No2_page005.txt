Warning: The Pill
May Be Hazardous

To Your Health

By the Vermont
Women's Health Center

There is not yet a “perfect”
method of contraception that is
both reliable and convenient,
and there may not be as long as
the research and development
remains in the hands of men
who never have to use these
methods. So for now,
heterosexually active women are
left with unpleasant choices
compromising either health,
spontaneity and/or convenience.

Although many women seem
able to take birth control pills
with no apparent harm, the
range of possible side effects is
broad and frightening. In an
effort to ensure that women are
fully aware of the risks to which
they are exposed by taking the
pill, the Vermont Women’s
Health Center has begun to ask
women to read and sign a
consent form before pills are
prescribed. Some women may
weigh the balance and choose to
stay with pills even while fully
aware of the dangers, but at least
these women are fully informed
and they can take responsibility
themselves for the choice. The
consent form is reprinted here so
we can all be more aware of the

dangers women still submit
themselves to.
VERMONT WOMEN’S
HEALTH CENTER
Birth Control Pills
Consumer Information and
Consent

Of all contraceptives, the pill
is one of the most effective in
preventing pregnancy, when
taken correctly. We feel that
those women who choose to
take birth control pills should be
fully informed of the
possibilities of serious health
risks. About 40% of pill users
report or develop some side
effects. In the majority of
women these side effects are
minimal and a nuisance, but
serious complications can and do
occur. It is our intention to give
you this information.

Side effects that may be life
threatening, lead to permanent
damage, or worsen over time:
Blood clots in the veins
(thromboembolism) which may
require hospitalization.
Thromboembolism is 10 times
greater in pill users versus
non-users. In non-users there are
six per 100,000 women, while in

the soft nakedness of my
unclothed body knows more
than you dare to admit.

100,000 women. Heart attack.
For women over 40 taking the
pill, the risk of heart attack
increases. For women who
smoke, the risk of heart attack
increases significantly over the
age of 35. High blood pressure
(hypertension). Usually returns
to normal when pills are
discontinued. About 5% of pill
users will develop high blood
pressure. There is about a three

times chance of developing
hypertension in continuing pill
users (five years) versus

non-users. Liver tumors.

Gall bladder disease. Possible
development of gallstones with
pain in the abdominal area and
indigestion. When the pill is used
four to five years, there is a two
times increased chance of
developing gallstones in pill users
versus non-users.

Signs and symptoms that may
indicate serious complications:
(1) headaches (severe) not
previously experienced, or more
headaches; (2) blurred vision,
loss of vision, or vision changes;
(3) severe leg pain, red streaks or
rash on legs; (4) tingling or
numbing in hands, feet, arms,

increase in sex drive; (7)

vaginal yeast infection with
discharge, odor, itching, burning

Play or
Fight?

By Robin Devine

Competition, the art of
outdoing the other, is so well
ingrained in our society that it
has become a virtue. At one time
only the boys and the young
men were taught to be competi-
tive (aggressive) with each other,
and the girls and the young
women were expected to be
passive (submissive). The “tom-
boy” seemed to be caught in the
middle. She acknowledged her
skills to be able to “compete”
with the boys; but because of
her sex, she was discouraged
from such participation. How-
ever, for the “tomboy” to be
active in the field of her interest,
she had to conform to the
societal laws set for men.

These moral laws include
doing the best you can (nothing
wrong with that) with the spirit
of beating another person in the
contest. That is where the
problem lies. To work or to play
to the best of your ability will
better your skills and will be
beneficial to your self-confi-
dence. But to beat another
person for the prize of winning a
contest can be detrimental to
both sides. On one hand, the
winner's ego can be blown out
of human perspective. S/he may
be so high (on the social ladder)
that s/he forgets what it is like
to be of a different developed
potential: a basic human rela-
tions problem — the executive
who cannot relate to the janitor.
On the other hand, the person(s)
who are declared the losers may
develop revengeful attitudes
towards the winners (potential
murderers) and/or they may feel
that they were unevenly match-
ed under false pretenses (the
Equal Opportunity employer).

Take the competition out of
sports, and the activity is no
longer a war to fight but a game
to play, as it started out to be.
Keeping the sport activities
confined to specific age groups,
i.e. junior high school, high
school, college, etc., only perpe-
tuates the competitiveness asso-
ciated with sports. The nuclear
family is solely responsible.

Anyone below our age bracket is
considered a “tag-along” and is
not encouraged to participate.
