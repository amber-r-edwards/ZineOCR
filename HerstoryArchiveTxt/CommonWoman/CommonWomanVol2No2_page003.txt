SUFFER THE CHILDREN

On Tuesday, Feb. 20 the  
Dept. of Social Rehabilitation  
Services held a hearing in Mont-  
pelier on proposed regulations  
that would raise reimbursement  
levels paid by the state for  
childcare services from $0.95/hr.  
per child to $1.00. The raise was  
angrily dismissed by a diverse  
crowd of about 100 as desper-  
ately inadequate. Although this  
means disaster for some centers,  
it may not put the state out  
much at all, as the other part of  
their plan is to change the  
subsidy formula so that many  
parents will receive less aid and  
others will no longer be eligible  
at all. True costs are estimated at  
more like $1.50/hr. per child.

This latest move by the  
state will — if successful — force  
many centers to meet their costs  
by closing their doors to child-  
ren who pay only $1.00/hr. This  
has already started to happen,  
creating centers that unwillingly  
cater only to middle and upper  
income children. In other cases  
the centers will simply close,  
leaving all the children stuck at  
home or in sub-standard daycare  
homes. Already 17 centers have  
closed around the state this year;  
they have long subsidized the  
inadequate state reimbursement  
by keeping programs and salaries  
minimal. (Typical of most “women’s  
work,” most childcare workers are  
paid little more than minimum wage.)

Although there were many  
impassioned and well-deserved  
pleas for the rights of children,  
there was little explicit acknow-  
ledgement that like it or not  
childcare issues end up being  
women’s issues. It is women who  
will end up at home with these  
children — women who have to  
quit their jobs and go on welfare  
to stay home — women who will  
be stuck in the mother role of  
the nuclear family that in such a  
rigid form is obviously not of  
their choosing. Yes, childcare is  
a feminist issue! And not just for  
mothers. Children are the  
responsibility of the whole cul-  
ture and the rights of all women  
are the concern of feminists. No  
woman is free until we each have  

the resources to be free to  
determine our own future. No  
woman should be ashamed of  
her biology or of her choices,  
whether it be the nuclear family or  
“motherhood.” For a large number  
of women this means high  
quality childcare they can  
afford.

Childcare is good for child-  
ren and for families too, both  
traditional and not. Few people  
who have children want to be  
with them 24 hours a day. The  
same is true for children; who  
wants to be with anyone 24  
hours a day! The “parent” roles  

were established long before any  
of us were born so no wonder  
few of us really fit into them.  
How wonderful then to have the  
option of childcare where child-  
ren can spend part of their day  
with people who choose to be  
there — who are genuinely  
interested in children and not  
just fulfilling a social role. It  
gives the kids the stimulation of  
other children and the parents a  
break and a fighting chance of  
enjoying their kids when they  
are together. For “high risk”  
kids (SRS’s name for battered or  
neglected kids) the chance to  
spend time in a loving and  
stimulating environment and  
give the whole family a break  
can literally be lifesaving. SRS

knows that — it’s standard  
protocol to fund care in these  
situations.

Business was well repre-  
sented at the hearing, especially  
from the city of Rutland. Mayor  
Godnick was there as well as  
representatives of the Industrial  
Development Corporation of  
Rutland, and various indepen-  
dent businessmen. While it was  
in some ways gratifying to see  
many different kinds of people  
there — especially the men  
speaking for children — it was  
hard not to feel nervous about  
these men in their suits saying  
they need childcare so their  
workers could stay at their jobs  
and their projections of munici-  
pal growth could be fulfilled. As  
we already know, women are  
paid less than men generally and  
it’s clear how convenient it is for  
men to have this pool of ready  
and cheap labor at their beck  
and call. This is not to minimize  
their genuine concern, but to  
question whether their interest  
in the issue really includes the  
rights of children to high quality  
childcare and women to self-  
determination. I’d like to see  
businesses set up some parent-  
controlled centers of their own  
and absorb some of the costs!

It is not new for childcare  
to be a means of manipulating  
women in and out of their roles  

depending on the labor pool.  

World War II saw women  
stopped and gave up their jobs,  
staying home to produce the baby  
boom and fit into the Doris Day  
homebody role of the ‘60s. It doesn’t look  
bad for the state if these women  
quit their jobs and stay home  
now. They don't swell the  
unemployment rolls because  
they quit. Some will end up on  
welfare but others will just  
reduce their incomes leaving just  
one household member working.

The women as usual were  
inspirational with their testimony —  
angry and impassioned. Mothers  
came to talk about their  
own children, their lives and  
their needs — women with  
handicapped children whose pro-  
grams would be cut out; working  
women forced by the subsidy  
formula to refuse pay increases  
in order to hold onto SRS  
benefits, women desperate in  
their lives to have the assistance  
of childcare.

Most daycare administrators  
and workers were also women  
and angry! To the delight of the  
crowd, Susan Linsky of King St.  
in Burlington invited Kent  
Stoneman of SRS to visit a  
center and spend several hours  
trying to take care of ten three  
year old children by himself — a  
ratio the regulations stipulate is  
adequate. Stoneman, however,  
didn’t bother to show for the  
meeting; and anyway, everyone  
knows he must have more  
important things to do. Helen  
Brink from Ethan Allen in  
Winooski refuted the task force  
recommendations on which the  
proposed regulations were based.  
They were adopted despite the  
protests of the entire member-  
ship of the advisory panel of  
center administrators. According  
to Helen, information and  
recommendations they supplied  
were ignored or distorted, and  
the resulting report is a disrepu-  
table sham. Many administrators  
were especially angered about  
this, feeling used and lied to by  
the state, and by Stoneman in  
particular.

Vermont Senator Mandigo  
and his Mandatory Motherhood  
friends were notably absent.  

Their focus now in their fight  
against abortion rights is further  
restriction of state funding for  
low income women’s abortions.  

Their true lack of  
concern for life is evidenced by  
their lack of participation in  
childcare struggles. While their  
rhetoric talks about the rights of  
children, they only reduce wo-  
men’s freedom to choose not to  
have children. They do nothing  
about making it easier for  
women to care for them when  
they're growing up.  
Many people spoke of how  
it would be cheaper for the state  
to pay for childcare now rather  
than for unemployment, wel-  
fare, jail, etc., later. This is an old  

line — a familiar trap propagated  
by the Money Mentality of  
business and government. The  

same line as “it’s cheaper to  
pay for an abortion than for  
childcare and welfare.” It is  
buying into THEIR idea that the  
real issue is lack of money and  
not radically misplaced priori-  
ties. Should money go to people  
to provide as wide a range of  
options for their lives as possible  
or to bolster business? Are  
efforts ever really made to get  
money from the rich to subsi-

KIDNAPPED!

By Linda Gwizdak

The events described below  
are the personal experience that  
a friend of mine wrote me  
about. In these reactionary  
times, I’d like to share her  
personal experience as a political  
kidnap victim.

In 1970, Susan Saxe, a lesbian  
anarchist, was accused of  
murdering a police officer in  
Boston. Saxe escaped and eluded  

the Federal Bureau of  
Investigation for five years.  
Finally, in 1975, she was  

arrested. During the five years  
that she eluded capture, the FBI  
was infiltrating and trying to  
disrupt the women’s and lesbian  
communities across the country.  
I will stop here and let my  
friend's words tell their story.

“I moved to Philly in the  

spring of ‘75, getting into lots of  

activities and political work.  
Susan Saxe got arrested and  
things got real tight and  
paranoid. Many wishy-washy  
activists, border folk and scared  

people headed for the hills and  

quit the political scene in droves.  
This was like April and May, and  
then in June I started RAID  
(Radical Action of Independent  
Dykes) — getting people to join  
was nearly impossible — by  
August I had abandoned it  
altogether in favor of other  
involvement like the Mexico  
IWY Conference (I was on the  
Philadelphia resolution hotline)  
and mostly because the NOW  
national elections were coming  
up in October and I was on  
about six Committees for it —  

doing two film festivals (also  

working on the local women’s  
paper and feminist bookstore).  
The convention came and went  
and I was getting itchy for  
community action work again.

“We did the ‘Kara’ number  
(“Kara” is a song she wrote),  
which raised a lot of eyebrows  
(and adrenalin) about taking  
power and making personal local  

changes. A local gay bill  
initiative came up and  
DYKETACTICS! (myself and  
five friends) was born and  

mobilized in 24 hours to pull off  
a front-page effort in its behalf  
— we wound up getting beaten  
by the police who we then sued  
for a quarter of a million dollars.  
By then the cops knew who  
we all were in the  
community and checked  

out. The 11th (four  
weeks after filing charges against  
them), I was abducted at  
4:30 p.m. by two men (one  
white). It is my belief  
that the local and federal  
authorities had succeeded in  
squelching the politically active  
women’s and gay communities  
after Susan's arrest. The  

DYKETACTICS! action roused  
many from their six months of  
hibernation into political action  
again. The town was hot and  
active again and I am convinced  
that my kidnap was intended to  
scare people back into hiding  
again (which it partially  
succeeded in doing). This is all  
retrospective of course, and at  
the time I didn’t know who or  
what the hell hit me or why;

“I was kidnapped at 4:30  
p.m. from 10th and Fitzwater in  
South Philadelphia by two men  
travelling in a blue car, black  
vinyl top. The one in the back  
seat, passenger side, put a gun in  
my back and ordered me into  
the front seat. (They had  
stopped to ask directions — I  
later found out that they had  
waited for me and watched me  

make a call to [her lover] from a  
phone booth.) The gun was kept  
to the back of my head — the  
man in the back took the gun  
away and yanked my head back  
over the seat and drugged me  

with a chloroform-type of  
chemical on a rag. They drove  
me to Camden, N.J., to an  
abandoned daycare center in a  
black neighborhood. Snow was  
several inches thick on the  
ground and it was the Christmas  
tree outside on the porch that  
later gave police one of the clues  
in finding the place. I was  
dragged to the porch and  
through a large open window  
leading to the living room area.

I was questioned  
periodically, re-drugged, for  
several hours — they ripped my  
coat up the back with a knife,  
took my hat, shirt and shoes —  
at some point I was raped — the  
questions were harsh,  
crazy-making and terrifying. For  
the most part, they related to  
groups I belonged to, details  
about them, interspersed with  
ridicule and insinuations about  
killing me.

“I came to in a park, lying in  
the snow half-naked. The pain in  
my feet was incredible and my  
head hurt so bad I couldn't  
focus clearly. I began to walk  
down the road and realized I was  
in Camden. From then on it was  
police, mug shots to go through,  
a near nervous breakdown,  
complete with cold sweats,  
nightmares and uncontrollable  
shaking times. After 48 hours,  
I was pretty much able to piece  
together what had happened  
except for the rape, which I  
suddenly remembered two months later.  
I felt I had betrayed my friends  
and community by giving out so  
much information, though I  
realized intellectually that I was  
drugged and it was involuntary.  
It subsequently became pretty  
evident that it was cops, feds, or  
some such variety, and that this  
wasn't the first such instance of  
its kind; it had happened  
likewise in other communities,  
though I had not heard about  
any incident like it before my  
own. A local paper ran the story,  
asking why the FBI was dragging  
its feet in investigating this case  
(the biggest mystery of the day).  
Well, they never did investigate.  
Local police couldn't investigate  
because it was federal and feds  
couldn't investigate because it  
was them. I have since learned  
that this kind of Catch 22 is  
common.”

This happened during 1977.  
Now it is 1979 and the FBI is  
still at it. Recently, federal  
agents were snooping around the  
lesbian community in New  
Haven, Conn. Their target is  
Kathy Powers. Powers was the  
alleged accomplice of Susan  
Saxe.
