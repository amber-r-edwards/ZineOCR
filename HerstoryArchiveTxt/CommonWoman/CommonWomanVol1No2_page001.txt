The common woman is as common as a common loaf of bread —
and will rise!

Soon after he became
President, Jimmy Carter vowed
that he intended to do for
women what President Johnson
had done for blacks. Toward
that end, he would appoint a
special assistant to the President,
so that women’s concerns could
be given special attention. That
assistant was Margaret “Midge”
Costanza.

It was a time of great
promises by the President and of

even greater hopes on the part of

the American public. The vast
women’s network that had,
together with the Black caucus,
pushed Jimmy Carter over the
top in the election, was filled
with renewed optimism.

Reality quickly set in during
the first year of the Presidency

BEHIND THE LINES-

THE PURGING OF
MIDGE COSTANZA

Carter’s infamous “Life is
unfair” statement, concerning
the lack of availability of
abortion for low-income women.
A mini-revolt ensued within the
administration, as outrage and
indignation brought top level
women from the cabinet
together to write and declare
publicly a dissenting opinion.
Midge Costanza helped
orchestrate this unprecedented

connecting and personally delivered
the writing text. CME Weis
felt that this act initiated her fall
from grace, that culminated
recently in her August 1st
resignation.

The campaign to humiliate
Midge into leaving her post
began in earnest this spring with
the public announcement that

her office had been moved to
the basement of the White
House. It must be remembered
that the significance of this
move was greatly exaggerated by
the heavily laden male power
symbolism of Washington. An
announcement that coincided
with her relocation stated that
her responsibilities had been
narrowed. This met with
widespread disbelief and it was
further noted that her duties had

been narrowed; they had all but

disappeared. White
good-ole-boys Jordan and Powell
had been content before to try
and undermine Costanza’s public
credibility; they now restricted
her physical access to the
President. In effect, her
influence on his policies was all
but eliminated.

Midge continued to

(sometimes humorously) to
defuse the tense situation, until
it obviously deteriorated from
bad to worse. One week before
her resignation, she was abruptly
ordered not to appear on the TV
show “Good Morning America.”
This seemed to be the result of a
head-on collision with the new
White House disciplinarian,
Gerald Rafshoon, hired by
Carter to boost his sagging media
image. White House Domestic
Affairs advisor Stu Eizenstadt
was sharing the long scheduled
TV appearance and it was feared
that Costanza might contradict
many of his statements. Only
Costanza and the President
know fully what transpired
during the following week,

KRISTINA BERSTER:

By Robin Lloyd

Kristina Berster was arrested
while walking near the Vermont
border on July 16, 1978, and
she will be tried at the Federal
Court of Burlington on Oct. 3
for conspiracy to cross the
border and an illegal passport. In
the month and a half that she
has been in our midst, the
American public has been
subjected to a variety of stories
and half-truths about her
emanating in part from the FBI.
At first, the director of the FBI
was quoted as saying that
Kristina was a terrorist and a
member of the “Baader-Meinhof-
Gang.” FBI PR man Tom
Harrington later said she was not
a member of the group, but this
did not make headlines. Most
readers were left with a confused
but ominous sense of her past
activities.

What is actually known about
Kristina Berster?

On August 22, Roz Payne and
Doreen Kraft, feminists and
organizers of the Kristina Berster
Defense Committee, were able
to visit Kristina at the Albany
Correctional Center. “It was
wonderful to be with her after
having read and thought so

much about her,” said Doreen.
“Due to our work with the
Defense Committee we were
considered paralegals assisting
her lawyers Dennis Schlenker
and William Kunstler; this
special status enabled us to get
in.

Like most prisons nowadays,
at Albany Correctional Center
entry and egress are fully
automated. It seemed that men
pushed the buttons and
controlled the gate, while
women patrolled the corridors.
Roz and Doreen were given a
thorough search in Deputy
Murphy’s office where the
official geniality seemed
reflected in the motto by Camus
over the Deputy’s desk: “Don’t
walk in front of me, I may not
follow; Don’t walk behind me, I may not lead; walk beside me
and just be my friend.” (Given
the context, one wants to add
“provided we’re handcuffed
together and I hold the key.”)

Kristina was playing volleyball
when they arrived, but shortly
came up to meet with them in
the library. Her comments on
her accommodations were
