ABORTION AMENDMENT

FIRST

UPDATES ATTACKED

By Nancy Powell  
On September 23, the  
House of Representatives voted  
to enact a piece of legislation  
that “perilously abridges freedom  
of speech and the press,”  

according to Walter Karp  
(Village Voice, Nov. 11-17,  
1981). The Senate passed a  

similar version soon after that, in  
what Karp and others call “one  
of the deadliest assaults on First  

Amendment liberties ever  
attempted on Capitol Hill.” This  
bill, the Intelligence Identities  
Protection Act, makes it a crime  
to reveal the identity of a CIA  
agent, even if that information is  
already public. (The Amendment  
reads, “Congress shall  

make no law... abridging freedom  
of speech or of the press...”)  

Phillip Agee, a former agent  
turned whistle-blower, and the  
“Covert Action Information  
Bulletin” are two especial targets  
of the bill. But the wording is  
broad; under it anyone can be  
prosecuted, convicted and im-  

prisoned for revealing “any  
information,” including infor-  
mation already public, which  

directly or indirectly reveals the  
identity of anyone working for  
or assisting the CIA.  

Washington, D.C. — October  
marked the beginning of month-  
long hearings in the Senate  
Judiciary Subcommittee on the  
Constitution. Lawmakers will  
discuss a proposed constitutional  
amendment, introduced by Sen.  
Orrin Hatch, which would not  
only remove abortion rights  
from the protection of the  
Constitution, but would also  
allow Congress to outlaw all  
abortion with only a majority  
vote in both houses. The mea-  
sure would send the issue to  
state legislators, provided the  
state law were more restrictive  
than federal law.  

Previously, anti-abortion  
forces have focused on the  
Human Life Amendment which  
would define a fetus as a human  
being with full legal rights from  
the moment of conception.  
However, the prospect of getting  
such an extreme measure  
through Congress has been  
bleak. Hatch’s proposal is alle-  
gedly an attempt to get around  
that resistance.  

Meanwhile, the U.S. govern-  
ment announced that it will not  
allow any 1981 federal health  
plan to pay for abortions, except  
when the life of the woman is  
at stake.  

Writes Karp, “...The chief  
activity of the CIA is to inter-  
vene politically in the internal  
affairs of half the countries in  
the world. The CIA... work(s)  
constantly to prop up pro-  
American governments, however  
inept or vile, and to subvert  
independent-minded rulers, how-  
ever popular or worthy. It is  
chiefly because the CIA’s  
embassy operatives are political  
manipulators, not spies, that  

their “cover” is of so little  
consequence.”  
ACLU's First Amendment  

expert, Floyd Abrams, calls the  
bill “flatly and facially unconsti-  
tutional” as well as “absolutely  
unprecedented and terribly dan-  
gerous.” Had the bill existed in  
1972, we would never have  
learned of Watergate, because  
the burglars were former CIA  
agents.  

This bill heralds a radically  
more closed society in the  
future, one in which people will  
have less and less information  
with which to participate in the  
“democratic process.” It will  
allow the government to con-  
tinue feeding us lies and  
heighten the Cold War mentality  
that justifies the budgets and  
actions of the CIA and the  
military.  

NO RIGHTS  

For the seventh time, the  
New York City Council has  
failed to pass a bill prohibiting  
discrimination on the basis of  
sexual preference. Observers say  
that the Catholic archdiocese,  
orthodox Jewish groups and  
municipal employees’ associa-  
tions were behind the defeat.  

JONI'S DREAM  

By Joni Avrutick  
I had a dream I was walking  
home along North Avenue when  
the earth began to tremble and  
shake violently. I was jumbled to  
my knees and then a long, loud,  
ear-piercing noise began.  

I covered my ears with my hands  
to numb the noise level, but the  
noise hurt and shattered inside  
my head. Next came the winds,  
blowing in big, heavy gusts. I  
tried to continue walking and  

found I couldn’t. I crouched  
down low and crawled until  
I reached the trunk of a nearby  
tree and hung on.  

When the winds stopped,  
I got up, feeling dizzy and  
nauseous, and began walking.  

I knew I had just  

some level of  

nuclear attack. I walked into a  
house where three acquaintances  
lived. I felt very sick and had  
little energy. I called them each  
one at a time by name and  
begged them to listen to me.  

“The nuclear holocaust has  

begun,” I told them. “I am  
dying of radiation disease.”  
They looked at me and laughed.  

“I need you to take me  
seriously,” I called to them with  
all my strength. “Please listen to  
me.” They refused to. I knew in  
my mind that I had to see a  
doctor. I needed someone to  
validate what was happening to  
me. I was dying of Radiation  
Poisoning.  

I continued walking. Slow-  
ly, sickly, I made my way up  
North Avenue. A man and a  
woman standing on their front  
lawn came up to me.  

“I’m sick and dying,” I told  
them, “from the nuclear explo-  
sion.”  

“Yes,” the man answered.  
“It’s happening.”  

I looked at my arm and saw  
my skin had turned white and  
was blistering. It was flaking off  
like a sunburn.  

“Maybe I'm dreaming,” I  
thought. “Maybe I'll wake up  

and everything will be all right.”  

I remembered that denial is the  
first stage dying people go  
through and realized again, this  
was happening. It wasn’t a  
dream.  

“What do you need?” the  
man asked me.  

“I need to see a doctor,” I  
answered.  

He told me the name of a  
doctor and where to find him.  

“You will need some money  
to pay him,” he said, handing  
me a $10 bill and some change.  

“I love you,” I told the  
stranger and burst into a flood  
of tears. In a flash I accepted I  
was dying and that this stranger  
was the only one who had  
listened to me and shown me  
compassion.  

I continued my sickly walk.  
My skin now hanging in layers,  
bleeding and burning, each  
moment growing more painful.  
I wanted to get to a doctor.  
I wanted to get some pills to end  
my helpless, painful suffering.  

Mayor Ed Koch gave only  
nominal support to the measure  
and failed to put the full force  
of his office behind it. 21  
lesbians and gay men held a  
sit-in at City Hall at the time  
of the bill’s defeat, and were  
arrested. Among others, an  
openly gay policeman had  
testified for the bill, a first in the  
city’s history. (Village Voice)  

(Women who were released  
were given citations to appear  
for arraignment at a later date; a  
tactic which incurs greater ex-  
pense for those arrested and  
breaks down the solidarity of  
the group. These women will  
most likely spend their time in  
jail alone, support groups having  
broken down.)  

FAMILY  

PROTECTION  
ACT  

SF, CA — H.R. 3955, better  
known as the Family Protection  
Act, threatens the rights of  
women, poor people, disabled  
people, minors, union members,  
lesbians and gay men, people of  
color and single people — to  
name a few. As Del Martin says,  
“The Family Protection Act has  
something to offend everyone.”  

Although the bill stands  
little chance of becoming law, as  

written, chief sponsor Paul  
Laxalt (R—Nevada), Reagan’s  
closest Capitol Hill ally, re-  

cently announced he intends to  
introduce sections of it separ-  
ately, hoping to pass them as  
riders on other bills. Conceiv-  
ably, parts of the Family Pro-  
tection Act could become law.  

“The Family Protection  
Act,” says Carole Migden of the  
Coalition for Human Rights, an  
umbrella organization of pre-  
dominantly lesbian, gay and  
bi-sexual community organiza-  
tions and individuals supportive  
of civil rights, “is the center-  
piece of the New Right's  
attempt to turn back the clock  
one hundred years and impose  
their brand of morality on the  
majority of the American peo-  
ple.”  

If enacted, the Family Pro-  
tection Act would:  

Deny federal funds to states  
that do not allow prayer in  
public buildings, or require pub-  
lic school teachers to belong to a  
union.  

Forbid federal intervention  
in state child abuse statutes. It  
exempts “discipline or corporal  
punishment methods applied by  
a parent” or an individual  
authorized by a parent.  

Prohibit federal funds from  
being used to promote educa-  
tional material that denigrates  
the role of women “as it has  
been historically understood.”  
Deny use of Legal Services  
Corporation money for litigation  
in abortion issues, school dese-  
gration cases, divorce cases, and  
homosexual rights cases.  

Deny federal funds to any  
organization which presents  
homosexuality as an acceptable  
lifestyle.  

Prohibit consideration of  
discrimination against declared  
homosexuals as an “unlawful  
employment practice.”  

To fight this bill and organize  
around the growth of and  
attacks by the New Right, the  
Education Committee of the  
Coalition for Human Rights of  
San Francisco is sponsoring an  
all-day conference November  
14th,

ACTS OF  
RACISM  

By Paij Wadley-Bailey  
Indian Creek used to be a  
lifeline for the predominant  
Black low-income population  
(1,000) of rural Triana,  
Alabama. The creek was a gathering

1861 “H38W39090/NVYWOMNOWWOO  

spot for the community and the  
source of fish was a mainstay of  
the Triana residents’ diet.  

In December 1978 it was  
discovered that the fish in Indian  
Creek contained more than 40  
times the federally determined  
safety limits of DDT; this town  
recently was listed by the federal  
government as one of the most  
hazardous sites in the United  
States.  

Wildlife is scarce in Triana;  
birds have disappeared from the  
area. The river is full of dead  
fish and fish with sores.  

Investigation disclosed that  
more than 837 tons of DDT was  
dumped by an Olin Corporation  
plant that produced insecticides.  
The levels of DDT in this Black  
population are extraordinarily  
high, according to Dr. Kathleen  
Kreiss who is investigating this  
atrocity. In fact, her studies  
showed that one Triana resident  

had DDT levels twice as high as  
any previously reported in medi-  
cal literature, and eleven others  
had levels comparable to those  
in the most heavily exposed  
workers involved in DDT manu-  
facture.  

The residents of Triana  
don't have money to see doc-  
tors. Even when they are sick  
they're not the kind of people  
who can just take off work.  
Triana’s cancer death rate is  
0.7% - almost 4 times the  
national rate of 0.18%.  
DDT kills bugs by attacking  
their central nervous system.  
Olin Corporation’s past  
environmental record is far from  
spotless. Its answers to interro-  
gatories reveal a 1979 New York  
conviction for violation of the  
Water Pollution Control Act, for  
which it was fined $70,000.00  
and from 1973 to 1975, Olin  
listed at least 10 other indict-  
ments, all resulting in fines, on  
charges of air pollution, water  
pollution and dumping.” (quote  
by Kathryn Strewer of The  
National Law Journal.)
