Fifty nations (one-third of
the world) have banned the
leg-hold trap, and today the
citizens of those nations are
pleading with the United States
to follow suit.

It is a disgrace that our
official national policy lags so
far behind the rest of the world.
It’s also a disgrace to the demo-
cratic process, since the Ameri-
can voice has risen in protest of
this trap. The mass of letters to
the last Congress have proved
this. And a Yale research pro-
ject, funded by the chief protec-
tor of the trap — the U.S.
Department of the Interior —
found that 78% of Americans
are opposed to the trap.

The leg-hold trap is the
epitome of sadism, on which
grounds the other 50 nations
banned it. But it remains the
trap in the United States and
thus certainly bespeaks the char-
acter of its defenders — those in

the bureaucracy and in the
National Wildlife Federation.
Their greed and indifference

toward living creatures and their
use of this device for agony leads
to the slow and painful death of
about 150 million animals and
birds annually.

Friends of Animals must see
that this trap is banished forever
from field and forest. U.S.
Representative Clarence Long
has re-introduced the bill which
would stimulate such bans. His
bill, H.R. 374, would prohibit
interstate commerce in furs by
states which have not banned
the trap. The bill would also
prohibit the importation of furs
and skins of wildlife from other
nations (such as Canada) which
have not banned the trap.

The leg-hold trap is a
disgustingly simple device and all
the more dangerous for that. It
consists of two tempered steel
jaws driven by one or more
powerful tension springs. When
the trap’s delicate trigger is
touched, these spring the jaws
shut with enough force to crush
flesh, sever arteries and break
bones. The trap, once set off,
remains locked under constant
pressure on the animal's leg. The
animal is held in never-ending
agony for hours, often days,
until the trapper arrives to club
it to death. Occasionally, the
animal achieves freedom by
chewing off its own leg, a
process termed “wring-off” by
the trapper.

The trap is not like a gun.
It’s not aimed. It is hidden. In
field and forest, next to streams
and brooks, its steel jaws clamp
shut on any living thing that
touches the trigger. In Maryland,
a four-year-old girl touched a
trigger and now must go through
life with a hand so crippled that
surgery could not reconstruct it.
The trap is so indiscriminate that
three out of four animals caught
in its jaws have no commercial
value. Trappers call these crea-
tures “trash” — dogs, cats,

Ban Leghold Trap

swans, ducks, eagles, reptiles and
all other non-fur-bearers which
are caught, clubbed and dis-
carded.

In most states these traps
are set out from November to
March, and since states are
accorded responsibility for trap-
ping rules by the Federal
Government, Representative
Long’s bill with its economic
impact provides the needed
incentive for the states to act
and to ban the leg-hold trap.

One letter, addressed by
name, to the two Senators and
one Representative from Ver-
mont, can do wonders: Give
them the name and number of
the bill (H.R. 374), the reasons
you believe it should be passed,
and ask them to see that the bill
is brought out of committee for
a vote by the full House or
Senate — irrespective of how
they feel about the bill. The
time is long past when a bill
should be bottled in committee
because some special interest
groups have made contributions
to a politician’s campaign fund
or because a trade-off is under-
way. And, of course, you also
request their positive vote to
support your position.

Attention, women: if you
haven't consciously known it or
even if you have, the media
industry is exploiting our bodies,
minds and the advances we have
made in the past years. This is
being done blatantly in the
worst instances or subliminally
in other instances. It is time for
us to reclaim our image, instead
of continuing to allow ourselves
to be subjected to the misogyn-
istic treatment they are present-
ly subjecting us to.

The film Killing Us Softly,
produced by Jean Kilbourne
and shown recently at Trinity
College in Burlington, excellent-
ly exposes this aspect of our
oppression.

It is estimated that women
are exposed to over five million
ads in our lifetime, be it TV,
radio, newspapers, magazines,
fliers, etc. These ads are not only
in general publications, but are
also in “feminist” publications.

There is a Revion ad which
states “little girls wear pink until
they’re ready for rouge.” The
woman in this ad is dressed in a
black ruffled dress that makes
her look very childlike. I feel
that this ad is not only exploi-
tative of women, but also of
female children. It suggests that
the woman/child is old enough
for sex and that this should be
taken advantage of. The attitude
of the media also reinforces the
male egocentric attitude that
women are children and helpless
and need taking care of. This
stereotype also feeds into the
male fantasy of rape, incest or
mutilation of women.

One of the major advertising

campaigns the media have pre-
sented is for feminine hygiene
products. Women, if you are

Killing

By Chess
using any of

the
following products, please stop,

presently

for you are endangering your
health: deodorant tampons, deo-
dorant pads, feminine hygiene
spray, spray deodorant, worst of
all chemical douches. The media
have attacked our subconscious
and exploited the feelings of
inadequacy we might have from
time to time. We are constantly
told that if we don’t use these
products we won't be loved,
sexy, wanted, or worst of all
that we will smell bad. Again we
can see how the media prey
upon and rape the psyches of
women for the sexual or mone-
tary benefit of men. Heaven
forbid that we should smell like
people instead of drugstores.

The women’s movement has
been coopted for the benefit of

men/media/capitalistic society.
“You've come a long way,
baby” — this ad slogan for

Virginia Slims implies that no
matter how successful we are we
will still be considered a baby in
men’s/media’s outlook. The pic-
ture is of a woman holding a
cigarette close to her mouth —
this has a subliminal message of
oral sex attached to it. Again we
get back to the old stereotype
that women are only good for
sex and baby-making. The Vir-
ginia Slims company has capita-
lized on the women’s movement
by perpetuating the idea that
women are no more than sex
objects to be manipulated for
their own good. Women: if you
smoke this brand of cigarette,
stop and think about the fact

that you are aiding and abetting
this company in degrading
women. Another vital point is

that Virginia Slims says we
are “liberated” because we can
now smoke, but of course
doesn’t mention that women

who smoke are subject to the

same diseases as men who
smoke.
Mutilation of women is

another form of advertising used
to exploit women by the media.
One ad that has been very
popular is the one for Max-
well shoes; in it a mannequin is
dismembered and lying on the
floor partially covered with a
sheet — there is blood on the
mannequin and sheet. The cap-
tion is: “I would kill for a pair
of Maxwell shoes.” This implies
that a woman's life is not as
important or as valuable as a pair
of shoes. Furthermore, the ad
implies that violence towards
women is justified in that
women are possessions that men
can mutilate in any way without
fear of repercussions. A second
example is one of a mutilated
mannequin in a store window
with the caption “Keep her
where she belongs.” In other
words, kill her if she doesn’t do
what you want.

Women: we are constantly
being presented as the prey for
men’s satisfaction, be it physical,
emotional, monetary or all of
the above. We are presented as
children, sexpots, druggies, in-
secure, neurotic, etc. Never are
we presented for what we truly
are, strong, independent, intelli-
gent, loving, brave, beautiful,
self-assured people. The reason
being that men control the
money, industry and power of
this country. Another major
aspect is that recognizing us as
we are would be too huge a blow
to the male ego.
