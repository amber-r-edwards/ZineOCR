Israel

As a Jew, a Socialist and a  
human being, I condemn the  
killing of a thousand Palestinians  

The Lebanese Christian  
Phalangists did the killing, as  
acknowledged throughout the  
press. But who condemned them  
for it?  

The Israeli army understood  
that Lebanese militiamen were  
going to arrest terrorists  
(=murderers) and remove wea-  
pons. These Lebanese militia-  
men then massacred a thousand  
or more Palestinian people —  
and the reaction of the world's  
press and politicians was:  
“wicked Israel for allowing the  
barbarians to slaughter the inno-  
cents!"  

To the extent that Begin’s  
government knew what was  
happening (and it is obvious  
from your paper and others that  
no one yet knows that extent) it  
is guilty of being a witness to  
murder.  

But what of the murderers  
themselves? Not a word!  

And isn’t it curious for the  
Left- and Right-wing press to be  
so in unison? They are — on the  
Middle East issue and no other.  
It's enough to make one para-  
noid.  

But you don’t have to be  
paranoid to notice the endless  
cheap abuse of language to vilify  
Israel, and the startling contrasts  
in reporting style and quantity  
of coverage of various Middle  
East events —  

War is killing and killing is  
horrible, and it hurts the spouse  
and children just as much  
whether it’s called murder, or  
massacre, slaughter or “casual-  
ties of war.” And being male,  
adult and “in uniform does not  
erase innocence — we are all  
innocent at the point of a gun,  
not only “women and children.”  

So why is it that nowadays  
the P.L.O. murderers are called  
“Palestinian soldiers” instead of  
“terrorists” which they still are?  
Why have these men, who hide  
behind their own women and  
children and deliberately let  
them die for the P.L.O.’s public  
image, now become heroes of  
the Revolution? (and since when  
has the Pope entertained heroes  
of the Revolution?) Why do you  
picture these barbarians with  

flowers in their guns, and  
alongside faked photos of  
injured children (faked, i.e.  

taken in the Lebanese civil war  
in 1976)? Why have you for-  
gotten that the P.L.O., not the  
Israelis, have been terrorizing the  
people of Southern Lebanon for  
years, and turning villages into  
military bases and little boys  
into murderers?  

Why has the recent war  
between the P.L.O. and Israel  
received so much more coverage  
than did the Lebanese civil war  
where a hundred thousand  
Lebanese massacred each other?  
Why do you condemn Israel for  

Palestine  

“allowing” the P.L.O. to slip  
through their lines, violate the  
ceasefire and murder Israeli  
soldiers?  

annihilation of hundreds of  
thousands of Palestinians, an act  
which came far closer to that  
stolen and much-abused word,  
Genocide, than any event that  
has followed it in the Middle  
East. But I see Yasser Arafat has  
forgiven Hussein already — such  
is his concern for the lives of his  
people, such is his memory and  
sense of justice. Or such is his  
crass opportunism?  

In seeking explanations for  
these strange imbalances of  
reporting, one answer seems to  
lie in the simple issue of victory  
and defeat. Before 1967, Israel  
was O.K. (“Kosher?”) with both  
Left and Right, and Zionism was  
rightly regarded as the National  
Liberation Movement of the  
Jewish people (it still is). But  
then Israel won a war (never  
mind that she fought it to save  
her life) and thereby had the  
audacity to survive — so her  
popularity diminished. The  
P.L.O. have just lost a war, so  
everybody loves them, forgetting  
their past and intended crimes,  
forgetting the most crucial point  
of all, namely, what would have  
happened had Israel not started  
this war.  

The P.L.O. are not guerillas  
anymore, they are an organized  
army. The vast quantities of  
military machinery they have  
been amassing in Southern  
Lebanon suggest nothing other  
than an intended invasion.  

An invasion which didn’t  
and won’t happen because Israel  
won't let it happen. Once again,  
Israel has fought a pre-emptive  
war for survival and been irra-  
tionally and incessantly con-  
demned for not losing. (But of  
course she did lose, she lost lives,  
but no paper prints pictures of  
Israeli widows weeping.)  

Who else was going to  
prevent the build-up with only  
one possible interpretation? Not  
the United Nations, not the  
United States or the Soviet  
Union or Lebanon itself. No, it  
was allowed to happen; so much  
for the world’s concern about  

~ Peace in the Middle East.  

Peace... Anyone who knows  
the heart and soul of Israel  
knows that the vast majority of  
Israelis are desperate for Peace,  
that they loathe having to do  
army service, that you will find  
less of the standard accom-  
paniments of soldiering (rape,  
looting, etc.) in the Israeli army  
than in any other army, and that  
Israel never ever kills needlessly  
or wantonly. And that 100,000  
people (out of a population of  
only 3.5 million) demonstrated  
for Peace in Tel Aviv.  

So please, let’s get Begin  
and Co. in perspective. He is not  

the whole face of Israel and  
Zionism.  
Although interestingly  

enough it was this Right-wing  
nutter who invited Sadat to  
Jerusalem and made peace with  
Egypt, and it is during his  
Prime-Ministership that the  
Middle East has come closer to a  

stable Peace than perhaps ever  
before. The first essential com-  
ponent of Peace between two  
nations is mutual recognition,  
and in Fez the Arab nations have  
to all intents and purposes  
recognized Israel's existence —  
after 35 years of refusal on their  
part and pleading on Israel's.  

Perhaps some mutual recog-  
nition is also going on between  
Begin and the Arab leaders; after  
all, they are comparable despots.  
Begin’s style suits the Middle  
East (except that Begin, not  
being in an Arab land, stands  
considerably less statistical risk  
of being assassinated).  

In the Arab world, unfor-  
tunately, Peace and Surrender  
are synonymous. The P.L.O. and  
other Arab nations are at least  
talking Peace; a cynic might say  
this is just because they have  
finally realized that the Jewish  
homeland will not be destroyed —  
even if Uncle Sam withdraws  
his opportunistic support.  

If my victory-defeat hypo-  
thesis (“we love you when you  
lose, we hate you when you  
win”) is wrong or too simplistic,  
what other explanation offers  
itself for Israel’s continuing and  
unjustified harsh representation  
in the press? (One minor but  
infuriating example is the Guar-  
dian’s habit of printing two very  
long anti-Israel letters followed  
by a short pro-Israel letter  
followed by a short indeter-  
minate one.) Well — I have  
another possible explanation in  
mind — but no, that’s just my  
Jewish paranoia.  

So if you can’t be fair and  
honest, let me at least be opti-  
mistic. Perhaps now we can start  
talking realistically about setting  
up a Palestinian state neighbor-  
ing (in two senses) Israel. There  
is a lot of hope for this, after all,  
we (Zionists and Palestinians)  
share many things in common.  
Not least of all our rhetoric —  
which they nicked.  

Palestine Plight  

I was quite distressed to  
read Joni Avrutick’s article con-  
cerning Israel (9/82). I whole-  
heartedly agree that anti-  
Semitism is a grave evil in the  
world today and that Jews and  
non-Jews must struggle militant-  
ly against anti-Semitism. How-  
ever, it seems that Joni has made  
the dangerous mistake of equat-  
ing opposition to the Israeli  
government with anti-Semitism.  
We must always strive to separ-  
ate the Israeli people and Jews  
from the Israeli government and  
see the Israeli government for  
what it is. Her article displayed a  
lack of understanding of the  
history of the State of Israel and  
the plight of the Palestinians.  

The Palestinians are three  
million landless people exiled  
from their homeland of thou-  
sands of years by the State of  

Israel. The Palestinian struggle is  
a genuine and deep-rooted move-  
ment for national liberation.  
Their claim is just: it is based on  
the fact of Palestinian existence;  
a common heritage, the labor of  
their ancestors, the cultivation  
of citrus and olives, trade, the  
building of the cities of Haifa,  
Jaffa and Lydda, their culture  
and dignity as a people. There is  
a sobering similarity between the  
situation of the Palestinians and  
the history of Native Americans.  
The reality is that Israel the  
State is an expansionist power.  
For 34 years, hundreds of  
thousands of proud Palestinians  
have been forced into hastily  
setup U.N. refugee camps with  
no means of survival except food  
depots and U.N. rations. Dis-  
placed again in 1967, this time  
from the occupied territories,  
the Palestinians faced a second  

exodus, twice refugees. The  
atrocious camps are the living  
grievance — they express the  

contradiction embodied in the  
existence of Israel at the expense  
of Palestine. Contrary to Joni’s  
assertion, Israel has never recog-  
nized the Palestinians’ right.  
Consistently, Israeli governments  
have rejected U.N. resolutions  
calling for the return of the  
refugees to their homeland,  
rejected the idea that the “so-  
called Palestinian people” exist,  
and insisted that they are the  
Arabs’ problem, not theirs.  

Israel is a settler colony.  
After World War II, with the  
British driven out, the U.S.  
partitioned Palestine in favor of  
the Zionists. The Hagana and  
Irgun, Zionist terror organiza-  
tions, initiated a campaign of  
violence against the Palestinian  
people to force them off their  
land and out of the cities: to  
create a state “clean of Arabs.”  
At Deir Yassin on April 9, 1948,  
the Irgun, led by none other  
than Menachem Begin, killed  
every one of the 254 Palestinian  
inhabitants. Poorly armed, over  
a million Palestinians fled over  
the borders, leaving everything  
behind. Israel seized and con-  
fiscated their immense lands and  
their property under the Absen-  
tee Property laws. The 12% of  
Palestinians who remained  
behind became hired labor on  
their own lands and lived under  

ARABIA  

military control treated as infer-  
ior people.  

Israel is a class society. Not  
only is it based on the special  
colonial relationship of super-  
exploitation of the native Pales-  
tinians, but half the Jewish  
population are immigrants from  
Asia and Africa — “Oriental”  
Jews — who face particular  
exploitation doing unskilled  
labor, living in the worst hous-  
ing, discriminated against by  
“European” Jews. These ten-  
sions and contradictions have  
produced frustration and opposi-  
tion among some sectors in  
Israel, notably the young.  

It is clear to progressives  
throughout the world that the  
Israeli government is the aggres-  
sor, the exploiter, and the source  
of violence and war in the  
Mideast. From Deir Yassin in  
1948 to Beirut in 1982, the aim  
is the same: to disperse and  
destroy the Palestinian people.  
And as long as U.S. imperialism  
continues to support Israel’s  
fundamental denial of Pales-  
tinian national rights, it will be a  
partner in this genocide.  

As long as the Palestinians  
continue to exist as a people,  
their cause cannot be destroyed  
and will not be defeated.
