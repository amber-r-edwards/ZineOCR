Daughters will develop bulging  
muscles. According to Dr.  

Haycock, women are physically  
incapable of developing bulging  
muscles, no matter how  
strenuously they exercise. Dr.  
Haycock uses herself as an  
example. She has played softball  
for 30 years and has never had a  
bulging muscle — powerful,  
sinewy back and leg muscles, but  
never a bulging muscle.

When questioned about  
“rough and tough” female  
athletes (especially among the  
Russian Olympic competitors),  
Dr. Haycock stressed that these  
women did not  
toughness but were chosen for  
competition because of their  
size. The Russians and the sports

Officials from the Warsaw Pact  
countries pick the best women  
athletes they can find to train.  
Very frequently the best women  
athletes for a sport are the big,  
powerful specimens. These  
women are not big and powerful  
because they've had sports  
training; they're big and  
powerful naturally, and that’s  
why they're chosen to train.

Let’s face it. Americans pick  
women who are skinny and  
seductive for their special  

approval and so tend to forget  
that there are big women. If we  
look around, though, we'll see  
that some of our women are big  
and tough — the women on the  
Oklahoma Dolls and other  
football teams, for example.  
We've all heard it said that  
little girls would have too high a  
potential for injury if they  
played Little League. For Dr.  
Haycock, this is nonsense. Some

Male coaches try to prove that  
girls are fragile creatures who are  
going to get more fractures than  
boy players. The truth is that  
until the age of 12 most girls are  
bigger than boys; they’re taller  
and they weigh more. Girls will  
get the same injuries as boys.

Many parents worry that their  
daughters will end up with facial  
scars if they engage in sports. Dr.  
Haycock acknowledges that  
unblemished beauty is an asset  
to girls and women in our  
society and that therefore it  
should be preserved. Football  
and hockey players should wear  
masks and a mouth guard to  
prevent having their teeth  
knocked out, for instance. But  
Dr. Haycock tells her patients  
that after 30 years of playing  
competitive sports she doesn’t  
have any facial scars. Neither do  
O.J. Simpson or Muhammad Ali —  
they're both still beautiful.

Surprise  

Continued from page 1  

From this point, the concert  
became an incredibly  
affirmative, women identified,  
lesbian identified experience.  
Holly introduced Wendy  
Dragonfire, a woman with a  
black belt in Karate who did a  
martial arts dance to Holly's  
song, “Fight Back.” Wendy's  
physical discipline, her powerful,  
beautiful body, the anger and  
strength in her dance, mixing  
with Holly’s singing, was very  
inspiring. The chorus of ‘Fight  
Back,” from Holly’s Imagine My  
Surprise album:  

And so we've got to fight  
back!/ In large numbers/ Fight  
back!/ I can’t make it alone/  
Fight back!/ In large numbers/  
Together we can make a safe  
home/ Together we can make a  
safe home.

Imagine our surprise! Meg  
Christian, Olivia recording artist,  

Classi  

Power Cole  

appeared and treated us to her  
music — and to a performance of  
“Leaping Lesbians” (on her Face  
the Music album). Meg got into a  
dramatic rendition of this song  
which spoofs the classic images  
of lesbians as child molesters and  
perverts. “Don’t look in the  
closet,” and “we'll save your  
children,” sung while Holly, J.  
T. Thomas, Wendy Dragonfire,  
and Timothy Near pranced and  
leaped through the curtains and  
onto the stage.

Holly’s concerts have always  
dispelled the myth that art need  
be non-political. Her music, her  
singing, her voice, through which  
she does her feminist work of  
demystifying, educating,  
inspiring, sharing, is incredibly  
versatile, strong, beautiful, vital.  
The concert in Lebanon was a  
wonderful and all too rare  
experience for those of us who  
attended.

Negotiations are now in  
progress between the Ethan  
Allen Child Care Center and  

Holly Near in preparation for a  
concert in Burlington on March  
25. Watch for advertising and  
don't miss it!
