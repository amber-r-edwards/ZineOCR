SILKWOOD: Death  
of a Union Woman

Karen Silkwood, a member of  
the Oil, Chemical, and Atomic  
Workers Union (OCAW), died  
November 13, 1974 near  

Oklahoma City, Oklahoma,  

under suspicious circumstances.  

Her death has never been solved,  

but a group called Supporters of  

Silkwood and various anti-nuke  

groups have banded together to  

push for an investigation and to  

file suit against the corporation  

which had the most to profit  

from in her death. At the time  
Karen Silkwood died, she was a  

twenty-eight year old divorced  

mother and lab technician at the  

Kerr-McGee plutonium  

processing plant in Oklahoma.  

Kerr-McGee is a huge energy  
corporation with a thirty-year  
history of bribes, price-fixing,  
and violation of anti-trust laws.  

Through its government  

connections, it received millions  

of dollars of tax money under  

the “Atoms for Peace” program.  

Karen Silkwood had been  

concerned with safety problems  

in the plant after she was  

contaminated by airborne  

radioactive particles because the  

company refused to order a  
respirator mask small enough to  
fit snugly around her face. She  
was elected to the steering  
committee of her union local on  

the basis of her push for better  
safety measures. In the summer  

of 1974, production speeded up  
and management concern for  
safety standards in handling and  
processing poisonous  
plutonium  

Plutonium stays radioactive  
for 250,000 years. Breathing or  
eating a particle large enough to  
see causes instant, painful death.  
Plutonium reproduces itself  
when processed through a  
nuclear reactor in a power plant.  

Kerr-McGee reported 73  
incidents of worker  
contamination in a five-year  
period. Not all spills were  
reported, only those which  
caused the shut-down of the  
plant. Workers were required to  
continue working in the area of  
a spill, but with protective  
clothing. Workers were put on  
production without training and  
without understanding the  
nature of the plutonium they  
were working with. Karen took  
notes on safety violations and  
reported them to the union  
leadership.  

The OCAW leadership  
supported Karen’s work and  
asked her for more  
documentation of Kerr-McGee’s  
violations, including production  
of faulty fuel rods covered by  
altering quality-control records.  
Another violation was a  
short-fall in Kerr-McGee’s  
inventory of plutonium: up to  
60 pounds of plutonium were  
unaccounted for. Kerr-McGee is  
being investigated in connection  
with a black market in  
plutonium sales.  

Because of her activities,  
Kerr-McGee put Karen under  
surveillance and wiretapped her

Mid-term elections have been  
compared to modern art, where  
there is outline and form, but  
beyond that, all is open to  
individual interpretation. This  
description of voter whimsy  
seems particularly accurate this  
year when just over one-third of  
those eligible cast ballots. For  
women, the election '78 results  
contain good news and bad  
news. Most importantly, there is  
conflicting news about voter  
sentiment concerning women’s  
issues.  

Women have the vote, but  
have very little to vote for. Most  
of our voting power is directed  
against particularly offensive  
candidates because there is no  
one we can support who will  
represent us. Throughout  

election ‘78, women were forced  
to choose candidates who were  
the lesser of two evils, and this  
negative voting translated into  
low turn-outs at the polls.  

Perhaps women should take a  
cue from the Washington, D.C.  
fight against taxation without  
representation. If women flexed  
their financial muscles by  
boycotting all taxation until  
they are satisfactorily  
represented, the United States  
economy would grind to a halt.  
But at the present time, this  
political fantasy stays in the file  
along with plans for forming  
feminist coalitions with labor  
unions and the Black caucus.  

At the local level, following  
election ‘78, the Vermont State  
Senate will have a slightly new  
look. Madeleine Kunin, the

Berster Vs.  
Immigration  

By the Kristina Berster  
Defense Committee  

Kristina Berster’s Kafkaesque  
experiences with the American  
legal system continued October  
25 with her conviction in  
Vermont’s Federal Court on  
three felony counts of making  
“false statements” to  
government agents and two  
misdemeanor counts involving  
Immigration and Naturalization  
Service (INS) laws. Legal  
observers at the trial noted that  
the five-day jury deliberations  
indicated an attempt by the  
panel to return verdicts of  
acquittal on all counts. However,  
Judge Albert Coffrin thwarted  
this outcome by giving  
extremely biased and restrictive  
supplemental jury instructions  
two days into deliberation.  

In essence, Coffrin ordered  
the jury to find Ms. Berster  
guilty if they found the evidence  
indicated she was not in  
immediate fear of her life when  
she crossed the border and that  
she had a reasonable  
opportunity to seek  
governmental protection from  
her fears of bodily harm. Both  
elements relate to the “defense  

of necessity,” the precedent for  
which is a case where a witness  
perjured himself on the stand  
rather than testify truthfully  
against an organized crime  
syndicate. Ignoring this  
precedent, Coffrin stretched the  
law in order to receive a verdict  
demanded by the Justice  
Department. These convictions  
are on appeal to the Second  
Circuit Court in New York City.  
Besides numerous other issues,  

Ms. Berster’s lawyers will argue  
that the felony counts  
represented “over-charging”  
the government —  
counts stemmed from essentially  
the same act — and that the  
majority of other Federal courts  
have held the particular nature  
of such “false statements”  
unindictable under the given  
circumstances.
