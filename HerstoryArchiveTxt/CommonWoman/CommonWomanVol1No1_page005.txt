Nationally for the ERA, United
Steelworkers, each carrying its
banner, marched in support of
the ERA and the extension to
the March 22, 1979 deadline.
NOW chapters from every state
in the Union were represented,
including the 100 people who
marched with the Vermont
National Organization for
Women banner, which had to
wait until 3 p.m. to begin their
march to the Capitol steps.

As they marched,
demonstrators waved posters

proclaiming “ERA Now!”,
“1776-1789. Rejoice! There was
no seven year limit. Support
ERA extension!”, “Never
Another Season of Silence Until
Women Have the Same Rights as
Men!” “Men of Quality Are Not

Threatened by Women of
Equality,” “Uppity R.I. Women
for the ERA!”, “None Are

Equal Until All Are Equal!”, and
“Uppity Women Unite!” Despite
the heat, marchers walked,
jogged and ran, holding hands to
keep their lines straight,
chanting ‘What do we want?
ERA! When do we want it?
NOW!” and ‘One, two, three,

four, we want three more! Five,
six, seven, eight, ratify in every
state!” In a spontaneous
demonstration of sisterhood,
young women ran ahead of the
marchers, purchasing soft drinks
and distributing them to people
at the front of the crowd; the
cans were passed hand over hand
back through the ranks to the
thirsty marchers, each taking a
sip and passing the cans along.
As the demonstration reached
the National Archives building at
8th Street and Constitution
Avenue, site of a march staged in
1913 by 8000 suffragists in
support of women’s right to
vote, which was broken up by
rioting bystanders, the ERA
marchers stopped to applaud a
group standing on the building’s
steps, holding a banner giving
the ERA’s text. Another small
group on the steps slowly tolled
a large bell in remembrance of
those who demonstrated there in
1913. As compared to the 1913
march, in which 200 people
were injured when violent mobs

attacked the suffragists, this
ERA demonstration was
non-violent and the crowds

lining Constitution Avenue were
mostly supportive.

After marching for an hour,
the front of the demonstration
neared the Capitol and the
chanting grew in intensity; at
1:30 p.m., the first
demonstrators reached the
Capitol steps and sprawled out
on the lawn, while thousands of
marchers waited, assembled at
the Mall, for their turn. The tail
end of the march did not reach
the Capitol until about 4 p.m.

Speeches began at 2:30 at a
podium set up on the Capitol
steps, surrounded by the banners
of each delegation which had
completed the 2 mile march

from the Mall. Former
Congressperson Patsy Mink
emphasized that the real

effectiveness of the march would
be the lobbying effort for the
extension legislation, House
Joint Resolution 638, which was
to begin the next day. ‘We must
not leave Washington... without
a firm commitment, yes or no,

from every member of this
body,’ she declared. “And if
they dare to turn us down... we

will turn them out on the next
election day.’ Presidential aide
Midge Costanza told the
marchers that she had brought a
message of support from

President Jimmy Carter, bringing
some applause, some boos and
cries of “Where is he?”

President Carter and his wife
Rosalynn were at Camp David
that weekend, celebrating their
32nd wedding anniversary. Most
members of Congress were also
out of town, taking advantage of
a 10-day July 4 recess.

In his message via Costanza,
Carter supported the extension
and called ERA the “bedrock”
for strengthening and extending
opportunities for women and
minorities. “There is no time
limit on human rights,” Carter
said in his message. “There is no
time limit on the full protection
of the Constitution for every
citizen.” Rosalynn Carter also
expressed her support for the
ERA in a statement issued from
Camp David.

Speaking for herself, Costanza
attacked anti-ERA leader Phyllis
Schlafly, who had appeared
earlier in the day on the
ABC-TV “Issues and Answers"
program. Debating NOW
President Smeal and
Representative Barbara Mikulski,
Schlafly had called the
demonstrators “a combination
of federal employees and
radicals and lesbians who march
and demonstrate in order to get
this illegal extension of time.”
Schlafly said that the ERA
demonstrators were “the same
crowd” who attended the
National Women’s Conference in
Houston, Texas last year, and
implied that the federal
government was paying for the
march.

“There is a woman in this
country who does not want her
rights and who has become a
spokesperson for women who do
not want theirs,” said Costanza.
“Our message for you, Phyllis
Schlafly, is that we paid for this
ourselves. We wish you could say
the same thing.”

NOW President Ellie Smeal
emphasized that the march had
been financed by contributions
from more than 300
organizations, including unions,
educational organizations,
church groups and women’s
groups. NOW confirmed that
most of the thousands who came
to Washington paid their own
way, while others were financed
by fund drives conducted by
NOW and the other groups
involved in the demonstration.
Looking out at the thousands of

demonstrators for the ERA,
Smeal cried, “Eat your heart
out, Phyllis Schlafly!”

Some commented that
relatively few blacks were

involved in the march, but two
of the speakers repudiated the
idea that blacks are against the
ERA.

“There is a malicious myth
circulating that we (blacks)
don’t stand with you, but that
myth has been promulgated by
the enemy. I'm here to indicate
clearly that we're willing to
stand behind you, beside you, or
in front of you on this issue,”
said Ron Brown of the National
Urban League.
Brenda Frazier, co-chair of
NOW’s Minority Women’s
Committee, said, “Laws aren’t
made for just one race. Those
who are for all civil rights must
stand together because we're
fighting the same kind of enemy
and we can’t allow ourselves to
be divided. You can be pro-God,
pro-family, pro-civil rights and
pro-ERA.”

Another speaker who
emphasized the importance of
working together was Jean
O'Leary, co-chair of the
National Gay Task Force.

“There have always been
lesbians in the women’s
movement,” she said. “There are
lesbians here today, to show
their support for the ERA,
which does not specifically help
lesbian women. We expect your
support in the struggle for
lesbian civil rights.”

The purple, gold and white
delegation banners of the
National Lesbian Feminists and
the National Gay Task Force
were prominently displayed at
the front of the Capitol steps
during all the speeches, perhaps
indicating that the “lesbian-baiting” of the early
days of the women’s movement
is over.

Two speakers, Wilma Scott
Heide, past President of NOW,
and Ms. magazine editor Gloria
Steinem, indicated that some
ERA supporters may resort to
more violent measures if the
amendment does not become
part of the Constitution soon.

“The lawful and peaceful
stage of our revolution may be
over,” said Steinem. “It’s up to
the legislators. We can become
radical.” Steinem said that if the
state and federal legislators
block ratification of the ERA,
“they will find every form of
civil disobedience possible in
every state of the country.”

Although radical measures are
a distinct possibility if legal
measures fail, most ERA
supporters are still struggling to
pilot the amendment through
Constitutional channels.

One of the last speakers of the
day, civil rights activist and
comedian Dick Gregory drew
fervent ovations from the crowd
and tears from many of the
demonstrators, when he
requested “a minute of silence
for all those women who died
because there wasn’t an ERA.”

Following the peaceful
dispersion of the massive ERA
march on Sunday, thousands of
the demonstrators remained in
the Washington area to lobby
their Congresspeople for an
extension of the current time
limit on the ERA’s ratification.
Estimated at almost 3000 by
NOW, the lobbyists descended
on their representatives and
senators on Monday, July 10,
and spent the day attempting to
convince Congress to give the
ERA more time. Much of that
effort was concentrated on
members of the House Judiciary
Committee, which was then
considering House Joint
Resolution 638, a proposal to
extend the deadline for ERA
ratification to March 22, 1986.

The House committee voted
on the issue on July 18,
recommending a three-year
extension. A companion bill,
Senate Joint Resolution 134, has
been introduced in the Senate
by Senator Birch Bayh (D-IN)
and 24 co-sponsors.

“Clearly, the ERA is as vital
as when originally introduced in
1923,” says NOW President Ellie
Smeal. “Debate on the
amendment continues; support
remains strong; and the
condition of society has not
changed in any way to decrease
the need or importance for an
Equal Rights Amendment.”

“If three additional states
have not ratified by March 22,
1979, and if the time limit is not
extended, the nation runs the
risk of the courts interpreting
this failure of passage of the
current ERA to mean this nation
does not want a national policy
prohibiting sex discrimination.
Such an interpretation could
lead to the narrowing of the
interpretation of the Equal
