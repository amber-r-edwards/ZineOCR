get and wiped out enormous
civilian populations. In addition
to the thousands who of course

died instantly, we are shown the

many thousands more who lin-

ger on for two weeks,

four

weeks, two months with terrible

variations of radiation sicknesses
and who die agonizing deaths
and suffer profound depressions
and psychic trauma. We see
women whose bodies have re-
ceived the ‘curious’ permanent
tattoo of the clothes patterns
they were wearing at the time of
the explosion, burned into their
skins, yes, women, youngsters,
animals, vegetation, no living
thing escapes the senseless mili-
tary rape of the land and life.
Throughout the entire film,

I have the distinct impression

that aside from the purported
military “necessity” and accom-
panying patriotic idiocy, that
what we are actually viewing is
the brutal and calculated mili-
tary medical experiment design-
ed to test the effects of ionizing
radiation on living flesh.
Historians would convince
us of the moral imperative and
patriotic military duty we had to
kill massive populations of hu-
man beings who were depicted
in U.S. propaganda as being
non-white (i.e., “sub-human”)
“dirty japs.” But still, the entire
tone of these old films is that of
an observation, a documenta-
tion, of the results of an exciting
experiment. Certainly that is the
only rational explanation for the
superfluous bombing of Nagasa-
ki, even if you could twist out a
logical explanation for the
bombing of Hiroshima. To cloud
responsibility, the voice-over

spouts continuous euphemistic
absurdities such as, “And three
days later a second and more
devastating tragedy visited Naga-
saki” — as if it were some act of
god instead of the evil action of
godless men that it was and
continues to be.

I hope that the students will
sit through the showing of these
films because I want them to see
this evil and know it in their
young souls and despise it and
be outraged by it. The hyper-
patriotic loyalty of the mid-
forties that was condoned and
encouraged by our government
included concentration camps
for Japanese-Americans in this
[California] and other states in
addition to the common practice
of strict curfews and the out-
right confiscation of property
and monies and businesses of
Japanese-Americans.

On the domestic scene, we

now know that the radioactive

nuclear fallout from all the
testing in Nevada 15-20 years
ago traveled in pinkish-red
clouds in air currents over
southern Utah, where residents
are now experiencing a 240%
increase in leukemia and cancer.
447 cancer victims and their
relatives have filed for hundreds

of millions of dollars in damages
against the Department of Ener-
gy, with many more claims
expected in the near future.
These people who trusted in the
assurances of complete safety by
the Atomic Energy Commission
would sit on their rooftops to
watch the strange clouds pass by
while parents delighted in hold-
ing Geiger counters against their
children to see the funny jump-
ing needle.

The history of nuclear tech-

nology is one of arrogance,
deceit, destruction, insanity,
fraud, conspiracy and death.

That men revel in its purity
lends further credence to the
notion that nuclear technology
provides the ultimate toys for
the ultimate boys.

On April 21, 1979, we
learned that there was a fire at
the San Onofre nuclear facility
in 1968 that was kept from
public knowledge. In that same
day’s news we learned that the
slogan “Keep the people con-
fused about (nuclear) fission and
fusion” was the official commu-
nique of President Eisenhower
to the Atomic Energy Commis-
sion throughout his administra-

tion.

After 10 years of faulty
operation, it has been aban-
doned as a total loss, leaving
behind 660,000 gallons of highly
radioactive nuclear waste plus
two million cubic feet of solid
radioactive waste in leaking
containers strewn over thou-
sands of acres. U.S. taxpayers
must give 1.1 billion dollars
to the clean-up operation. The
horror of West Valley does not
end here.

Local birth defects and
instances of cancer and leukemia
are well above the national
average. For 10 years, the
standard procedure was to ga-
ther up the local unemployed
teenagers, transients, bar pat-
rons, college students and other
“expendable” human beings to
work at the plant for 15 seconds
to 30 minutes. These “fresh
bodies,” as they were referred
to, were hired to do the dirty
work, exposing themselves to
highly radioactive materials. In
policy, they were not to be
rehired for “safety” reasons, but
in practice many were rehired
daily and never warned of the
consequences. To my way of
thinking, such behavior is cri-

minal.

As the nature and mentality
of the nuclear beast becomes
clearer, it too becomes all the
more hair-raising to comprehend
that the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission (NRC) inspects
only one to five percent of the
safety related activities in each
nuclear plant and that the rest is
left up to the honesty of the

individual utilities and their
contractors.
Emergency Core Cooling

Systems (ECCS) is the single
most crucial link between a
malfunction and a meltdown. In
1970, the Aerojet Nuclear Com-
pany ran tests on six ECCS
models and every test failed. To
this day there is no scientific test
data to show that ECCS is a
reliable system.

Every nuclear plant in the
country has all of its cables,
including the backup cables, in
the room beneath the control
room. There can be and have
been fires in this area that can
paralyze the entire facility. One
of the worst cases of this type of
accident happening was at the
Browns Ferry facility near
Athens, Alabama in 1975. A
worker who was looking for a
leak with a candle (incredibly,
this was standard procedure) set
fire to the entire cable system
and completely wiped out the
ECCS and the four other backup
systems. A small hydraulic
pump, never intended to pump
huge amounts of water, averted
a very near total meltdown.

Fires are not uncommon.
One record, not even the worst
one available, is the 200 fires at
the Rocky Flats nuclear facility
in Colorado, not counting those
in the last five years. This site is
the sole U.S. manufacturer of
plutonium triggers for the neu-
tron bomb. As of 1974, they
have had 171 plutonium conta-
mination cases, and plutonium is
showing up in human tissues of
the local population.

In 1976 alone there were
861 “abnormal events” at nu-
clear reactors, 371 of which
were potentially hazardous.
There have been 250 truck
accidents involving nuclear waste
just between 1971 and 1977. In
one incident in 1977, three
horses ran in front of a truck
which crashed, spilling 10,000
pounds of radioactive uranium
concentrate over a 5000 square
foot area, in some places a foot
deep. Twenty-six of the estima-
ted 60 people who stopped and
waded through this material
known as “yellowcake” were
eventually informed a week later
that they should take a shower.
Exxon debated for three days
whether they would even take
responsibility for the cleanup,
but eventually they agreed to,
saying an unskilled labor crew
would help cut costs. This was
even too corrupt for the state
officials, who insisted that they
hire trained health experts. It
was a week before anyone from
the NRC showed up.

Other nuclear (nukiller?)
accidents include the three plu-
tonium bombs the U.S. accident-
ally dropped on Spain, nuclear
waste that fell off a Delta
Airlines toward and spilled, the
underground nuclear test that is
believed to have touched off the
earthquake in Iran this past
September that killed 16,000
people, and currently, of course,
we have the 47,000 55-gallon
drums of leaking nuclear waste
30 miles west of San Francisco
Bay. Nobody wants to clean it
up, so in the meantime the
radioactivity is leaking into the
bay area’s major fishing grounds
every day and there are three-
foot mutant sponges attaching
