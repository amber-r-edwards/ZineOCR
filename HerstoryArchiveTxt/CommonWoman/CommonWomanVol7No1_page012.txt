THEATRE

At the Foot of the Mountain
Seeks New Scripts by Women

New scripts by women are
being solicited for staged read-
ings At the Foot of the Moun-
tain, a professional women’s
theatre of protest, celebration,
and hope. We will produce six

bring the playwrights to Minnea-
polis for a week of rehearsal and
performance, and pay each play-
wright a small stipend. Scripts
must be previously unproduced
by mainstream (equity) theatres.
We are particularly interested in
producing works by women of
color. —

your work and a resume, or a brief

By Carola Carbajal
& Guadalupe Mainero del Paso

We are a group of women
in Cuernavaca,
a small city an hour
from Mexico City. For
the past year we have been working

with women of different social

classes in this city and in several
villages in the surrounding area.
We have worked with Health as
one of our goals, looking for the
reasons of sickness through the
experiences of women we are in
touch with.
We know there are a lot of
books about sexuality here in
Mexico. We also receive in
school some elemental notions
about this matter. However,
when we get in touch with
women, we realize that they
know very little about the
functioning of their bodies as
well as their sexuality, and
these facts reinforce their
oppression. That is why we need
to elaborate a pamphlet about
sexuality, which not only

Sexuality

Dear Friends

It's that time again — the
call for papers for the Berkshire
Conference on the History of
Women. As you may remember,
the Lesbian Panels at the last
conference were often the most
exciting and well attended of all
the workshops. We broke new
ground; now let us continue.

The theme of the 1984
Conference is “Reassessing Our
Past: Women's History After 15
Years.” Please search your minds
and desks for ideas for papers or
panels or slide-shows and submit
them as soon as you can for the
deadline is close.

Here are some suggestions
to help get ideas going:

—the growth of grassroots
Archives in the last decade.

“sexual desire as history.
—the change in what we see

as historical — the inclusive

concept of history.

Amazon warrior rises as a persistent phoenix. Legend, myth, and history are filled with accounts
of women archers, their right breast removed through ritual and custom, a physical sacrifice and
emotional contribution to the collective consciousness of their matriarchal society.

In contemporary terms the figures are symbolic heroines, pictures of our inner selves, includ-

—a ten year
Lesbian communities

—a decade of Lesbian publi-
cations and publishing themes,
changes, etc.

—ten year overview of Les-
bian civil rights struggles, i.e.
Lesbian mothers

—an overview of how Les-
bians have been portrayed in the
media and why

—a critique of what
women’s history has not done

Please call if you have any
questions or inspirations.
Remember the Archives is at
your disposal.

Book

describes women’s functioning
in a mechanical way, but that
lets them recognize their beliefs
that devalue them as women.

As we take the ideas from
discussions taped during our
encounters with workers, pea-
sants, and suburban women, this
pamphlet has been written in a
simple language. We have already
elaborated this pamphlet, includ-
ing the drawings. But we do not
have the money to print it. This
is why we are asking for your
aid. The pamphlet has 120 pages
and in order to print 3,000
copies, we need one hundred
thousand Mexican pesos, which
means $6,100 American dollars.

We're looking for photographs

We have posed several ques-

are intended as guidelines. You
are not required to send us your
answers. We would, however,
like you to think about these
issues and send us some com-

CALL FOR MATERIAL

Lesbian Herstory

‘Pregnant Lesbians

We are producing a film
about lesbians who decide to
have children after they’ve come
out. Although there are lesbians
who've done this, the topic
remains largely undiscussed and
very few resources on the
subject exist. Occasional articles
appear and support groups have
sprung up in some urban areas.
The documentary film we are
making will start to fill in this
gap by providing specific infor-
mation (how people get preg-
nant, legal ramifications, etc.),
role models for lesbians con-
sidering becoming mothers, and
a context in which to think
about the questions which arise.

We are writing to ask your
readers for their help. We are
looking for lesbians who have
had children since coming out,
are pregnant, or are seriously
considering motherhood. We
would like to hear from as many
women as possible, both those
who might be willing to appear
in the film as well as those
who would not. Their stories will help us shape the
film's content.

If you are involved in
pregnancy (yourself or as
friend or lover of a lesbian who
is), please write us or pass this
request on to someone who
is. Once we hear from you, we'll
explain the project and what
we'd like to know in greater
depth. All information we
receive will be confidential. Our
address is 46 Bay State Avenue,
No. 2, Somerville, MA 02144,
