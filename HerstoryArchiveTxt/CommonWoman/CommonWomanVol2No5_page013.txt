WANDE RGROUND

Wanderground Stories  
of the Hill Women, Persephone  
Press, $5.

By Joyce Cheney

There is a story that in the  
50s, there was some trade fair in  
the USSR, and the good ole  
USA, for their exhibit, built an  
entire supermarket, rows and  
rows of different packagings of  
the same stuff, produce and  
meats in plastic packages, freez-  
ing compartments open to the  
air... the usual. The citizens  
there didn’t believe it. They  
thought it was a hype. It was  
just too far from their reality for  
them to accept the vision.

Similarly for me, a cynical  
lesbian in the belly of the beast,  
it is sometimes hard to envision  
a way of life different enough  
from today’s to be life-sustain-  
ing, life-encouraging. I have  
imagined and experienced lots of  
changes, bits stolen from the  
man, large from one perspective  
and tiny from another. What  
victory is a womyn’s carpentry  
job, when she gets harassed all  
day? A womyn’s land trust is a  
victory, but it is too small to  
shelter all who need it, and  
becomes chaotic and tense. A  
womyn-run business, — selling  
luxuries to the wealthy, is only  
partly out of his clutches. These  
small victories leave me feeling  
crazy. My visions have been  
limited to these small changes. I  
have been nearsighted.

Then two things happened.  
First, I read Wanderground,  
Stories of the Hill Women, by  
Sally Miller Gearhart, and it gave  
me a vision of bigger changes,  
changes on levels I didn’t even  
know were there, of a better  
way, possibility.

Wanderground is a vision, of  
a womyn society based on  
loving, not on might.

At one time, Mother Earth  
had just had it.

“..rememberings of the  
Revolt of the Mother.

“Once upon a time, there  
was one rape too many. Once  
upon a time... The earth finally  
said ‘no.’ There was no storm,  
no earthquake, no tidal wave or  
volcanic eruption, no specific  
moment to mark its happening.  
It only became apparent that it  
had happened, and that it had  
happened everywhere.”

Mother Earth left to the  
men a few environments, a few  
inner cities. Outside of their  
cities, their machines, cars, fac-  
tories, tractors didn’t work; they  
couldn't rape the land. Outside  
their cities, their pricks went  
limp; they couldn’t rape womyn.  
Horses wouldn’t carry them;  
plants wouldn’t grow for them.  
So they lived in the cities. There  
they took their vision to its  
ultimate — plastic synthetic,  
controlled, distrustful, violent;  
they were contained.

And in the hills, the womyn  
took their vision to its ultimate,  
a society where womyn feel  
their strengths, and can physical-  
ly and psychically fight, where  
they can use their psychic  
strengths to communicate, to  
protect themselves, to share  
experiences, to work, to heal, to  

fly; where people of any age are  
valued, with their differences  
respected instead of wasted;  
where death is an integrated part  
of living, where womyn acknow-  
ledge their connection with —  
their partness of — the whole of  
nature, where relationships are  
not binding, but free/growth-  
producing. Utopia? Yes.

Now I’ve read essays that  
describe utopias like that; all  
those word-goals are current  
feminist rhetoric. But Gearhart  
describes the Wanderground in  
ways that really make me feel  
the possibilities.

Part of what makes it a  
reachable possibility is that all is  
not easy in the Wanderground.  
Every womyn goes through  
painful rememberings, sharings  
of where she came from (where  
we are now), in order to  
strengthen herself/themselves.  
And womyn go on mission  
rotations as border guards, and  
spies in the cities, to guard  
against the patriarchy’s possible  
encroachment from the cities. In  
the cities they see trapped  
womyn, grotesque, living lives  
not so far removed from how  
we're supposed to be living now.

“She was a thing out of  
history to the hill woman: a  
thickly painted face, lacquer-  
stiffened hair, her body encased  
in a low-cut tight-fitting dress  
that terminated at mid-thigh; on  
her legs the thinnest of stock-  
ings, and the shoes — were they  
shoes?...

“Amazed as she was, Ijeme  
knew that she was in the  
Presence of a woman — but not  
a woman as she knew women.  
This was the city edition, the  
man’s edition, the only edition  
acceptable to men, streamlined  
to his exact specifications, her  
body guaranteed to be limited,  
dependent, and constantly avail-  
able. Ijeme shuddered, then  
repeated to herself the words of  
an early lesson: ‘what we are not,  
we each could be, and every  
woman is myself.’”

Not easy maybe, but there.  
I have been nearsighted, but at  
each area, each detail, my  
fantasy extended is in Wander-  
ground. Had my fantasies wan-  
dered that far — when they do —  
they go to Wanderground.  
Because Gearhart’s fantasies  
come from the same places as  
mine, I believe them, I take  
them on.

I know I have felt the  
powers that the womyn in  
Wanderground routinely use. I  
have felt them only sometimes,  
with my devalued, denied and  
embarrassing intuitions and irra-  
tionalities.

herself spreadeagle on  
her stomach, her hands rubbing  
the earth, her whole body  
moving up and down. Ursula and  
Krueva flanked her, holding her,  
holding each other; holding the  
cool earth.

“Breathe with me, Ursula.’

“Breathe with me, Ijeme.’

“Breathe with me, Krueva.’

“They dropped their soft-  
selves to diaphragm level and  
began.

“They drew in the earth,  
these three, into themselves, into  
each other.

“They came back only later  
to the forest.

“Fully given and well-  
taken,’ said Ijeme.

“From eternity,’ — said  
Krueva.

“For eternity,’ said Ursula.

“Deep.”

“Deep.”

“Deep.”

“All three waters. Deep and soon.

What can I tell you? How  
can I share the excitement? How  
can I — a cynic — write this  
article, and put in linear words  
something that feels like star-  
bursts and thunder? Only: read  
the book. It will touch you, and  
you will fly with it, because you  
and I are from the Wander-  
ground. These are our visions  
and experiences, that we have  
each felt in moments, sometimes  
crazy and denied, sometimes  
briefly rainbow-felt.

The book is about power —  
about our power coming from us  
and through us. The book is not  
just ink and paper; it is energy.  
Reading it made me cry. We are  
so far from that vision. But it  
also makes me high. I have felt  
my vision inside me, tentative  
and denied; now it is exploding —  
possible.

I can’t seem to get these  
paragraphs to share the excite-  
ment as much as it is there. I can  
only tell you that the next day,  
I (linear, controlled me) spon-  
taneously thanked a mulberry  
bush for its offsprings and meant  
it. I had lunch with a butterfly,  
and made friends with a snake.

THE DINNER PARTY  
JUDY CHICAGO

And that Night (Remem-  
ber? Wanderground was only  
the first of this visioning/un-  
layering), I learned more about  
my/our energy. I have been sick  
for a while, and thought I knew  
about alternative healing, I knew  
the mechanics (drink this, do  
this...). But that night I learned  
about the energy of healing. A  
new/old friend shared healing,  
loving, supporting energy with  
me, and I've begun to heal.  
Good energy is healing me.

After that healing night, I’ve  
begun to see us womyn differ-  
ently. I’ve known we are a  
resource pool (writers, players,  
hammerers, bikers...) Now I  
know another layer — that we  
are an energy pool — we are  
sharing womyn power with each  
other. We are much more  
than meets the eye; we exist in  
ways they haven’t thought of.  
We can fly!

This is a news story. It’s not  
point-in-time news, like car  
accidents and tax increases. But  
touchstone news, sparking news,  
life-changing news of our own  
energy.

The womyn’s community is  
not perfect, not done growing.  
We feel differences and divisions.  
We can trust that we are in the  
process of shedding the eyesight  
of divisions/comparisons/judg-  
ments; that we are searching for  
and building unions, shared  
spaces, togethers. We are not all  
there. There is pain, anger,  
jealousy — all the products of  
divisions, because we are where  
the womyn of the Wander-  
ground had to remember back  
to, where they once were. We  
are still within the journey —  
but it is our journey, our vision,  
our possibility, our power. We  
can fly!

This book is based on Judy Chicago's work as expressed in “The Dinner  
Party Exhibition,” a room-sized sculpture that is a celebration of all women  
and dedicated to the preservation of their traditional art forms. Consisting  
of 39 place settings designed by Chicago, each setting is executed in a  
different traditional china painting and needlework technique, and each is  
a tribute to a mythic female character or historic figure who has been  
important to the lives of women. It is a major exhibition which is to tour the  
entire country. The book will give the full story behind the project—a con-  
tinuation of the goals Judy Chicago discussed in Through the Flower—  
and of its execution through the efforts of 200 people working in a studio  
environment. Full-color reproductions of the individual plates and detailed  
descriptions of various china painting techniques will be included.

Shrew

Review: The Taming of the  
Shrew, by William Shakespeare,  
presented by the Champlain  
Shakespeare Festival

By Jo Schneiderman

With The Taming of the  
Shrew, this season's opening  
production, the Champlain  
Shakespeare Festival has created  
a production at once offensive  
and entertaining. It is crisply  
staged, fast-paced, beautifully  
costumed, and highly obnox-  
ious.

The story is about how a  
lovable rogue, Petrucchio, mar-  
ries an outspoken and angry  
woman, Katherine, in order to  
get her substantial dowry, plus a  
bribe offered by Kate’s younger  
sister’s suitors. Petrucchio “  
charmingly” beats, starves and tor-  
tures his new wife, leading her to  
blind obeisance and causing her  
to fall in love with him (in spite  
of any logic).

Taming goes to show that  
even Shakespeare can write  
something wherein the plot is so  
offensive that it should not be  
done, at least not right now, and  
at least not without a more  
modern interpretation.

Taming of the Shrew is not  
a lost cause. Shakespeare was  
such a great playwright that it is  
possible to present his plays to  
give practically any message you  
wish. Kate could have been  
portrayed as “shrewd” through-  
out, feigning loyalty and love at  
the end.

It is hard for me to believe  
that the Shakespeare Festival is  
so out of it that they think wife  
battering is funny. It is hard to  
conceive that a woman would  
choose to direct this play from  
that perspective. Yet Annabelle  
Melzer, assistant professor of  
drama at Tel Aviv University,  
chose a treatment of the play  
which weakened the character of  
Kate, portraying her as whiny  
rather than shrewish, and  
presented Petrucchio in an unwaver-  
ingly positive light.
