INCEST

Continued from page 5  
I think that the time Dad

forced me to strip in front of  
him and harassed me for almost  
an hour about how I was  
“throwing away” my beauti-  
ful body, and made me look at  
myself in the mirror while he  
went on and on, made me think  
of sex as a punishment. After all,  
that whole episode was supposed  
to be “discipline” because I'd  
been skipping school. I think  
I've felt that I wasn’t supposed  
to enjoy sex because the idea of  
sex got all tangled up with the  
idea of punishment.

Things are getting better.  
I used to make love two or three  
times a week with my husband  
and only reach orgasm once a  
year, and now I may only make  
love once a week or once every  
other week, but I climax every  
four or five times. The ratio is  
better; I'd rather climax once a  
month than once a year.

ELIZABETH: I wonder if  
you think you can get past what  
happened to you with your  
father and be able to be fully  
sensual and have an orgasm most  
of the time. That certainly is  
something to aim for.

SARAH: Well, I think it’s a  
matter of being able to respect  
myself and my body, and that  
takes time. Other things have  
happened in my sexual life that  
have made it hard for me to  
respect myself. When all this was  
happening with Dad and I didn’t  
think I could share it with  
anyone else in the family, one of

my reactions was to have sex  
with as many men as I could.  
I felt cut off from the family, and  
I needed some kind of reassur-  
ance that someone cared enough  
to be “nice” to me and treat me  
like an adult. Just wanting  
someone to hold me and act as if  
they care for me is a big part of  
sex for me. But when you're  
going through a series of one-  
night stands, all you’re getting is  
physical gratification, at best.  
Physical affection helps, but you  
also need somebody who's relat-  
ing to you on a personal level  
and trying to help you grow.

ELIZABETH: I hope that  
you can grow out of the effects  
of your relationship with your  
father. Is it something you think  
you can grow out of?

SARAH: I think that I have  
been working on that and I  
think that eventually, when Dad  
is ready for it, we'll be able to sit  
down and have an intelligent  
conversation about it. I try all  
the time to change old patterns,  
even though a lot of them are  
subconscious, and I think that  
I'm reaching a sensitive relation-  
ship with the man I’m with now.

I don’t think that my  
experience with incest is by any  
means as bad as it has been for  
some people. When I look at the  
whole picture of what has  
happened to me, sexually and  
emotionally, I don’t think what  
happened between Dad and me  
has had as big an impact on me  
as incest has had on some  
people.

ELIZABETH: No, but I do  
think it’s had a large impact on  
your sexuality. I tried to bring  
you up with a very open attitude  
toward sexuality — I tried to  
give you the facts and never said  
something was “bad” or “dirty”  
just because it was sexual — and  
yet you have had a lot of prob-  
lems with sex.

SARAH: I think I’ve had  
problems because it’s been hard  
for me to accept myself and to  
accept physical contact without  
it being forced on me.

ELIZABETH: I think that  
sexuality is very closely linked  
with self-esteem and some of the  
things your father did to you  
destroyed your self-esteem for  
quite a while. I’m glad that  
you're working on it and I hope  
there will come a time when you  
and I have completely recovered  
from the impact of what hap-  
pened. But sometimes I think  
that I'll never get over it.

afternoon, and university boys

P.S. There is an arcade in  
the Ethan Allen Shopping Cen-  
ter, but I’ve never been there.

P.P.S. If an arcade feels like  
a bit much and you'd like  
something more simple, try the  
Steer and Stein on Elmwood at  
North St. It’s a neighborhood  
pub with a fine, non-oppressive  
and winnable pinball machine.

In my own touring of  
Burlington’s bright lights, I have  
2-3 favorite games at each place.

Always included among them is  
PAC-MAN, a yellow ball that  
becomes a mouth munching up  
little dots (for points) while  
being chased around a maze by  
four ‘critters.’ The goal is to  
consume all the dots before the  
critters consume you. A player  
gets three yellow balls (Pac-men)  
and another at 10,000 points  
and can continue eating his way  
through maze after maze until  
all his Pac-men have been caught  
by the critters. Figuring out a  
pattern through the maze, or  
learning someone else's, is the  
key to success in this game.  
Scores have gone as high as two  
million. My best has been  
142,860 (!) on the machine at  
Nectors. For those who would  
like to try, I will gladly pass  
along the pattern someone  
shared with me.

This may not be the most  
profound way in which to end  
an article, but let me share with  
you just one additional thought.  
PAC-MAN has been one of the  
most popular of arcade games  
and is a perfect example of the  
subliminal message that these  
games were created by men, for  
men.

There is in the real world a  
phobia called Vagina Dentata  
wherein men believe that women  
have teeth in their vaginas and  
can destroy men’s sex organs.  
Consider for a moment the  
implications of calling this game  
“PAC-WOMAN,” and defining  
the object of the game as making  
the yellow dot become a mouth  
with which to destroy all the  
balls on the screen. I wonder  
how popular the game would  
have become then?
