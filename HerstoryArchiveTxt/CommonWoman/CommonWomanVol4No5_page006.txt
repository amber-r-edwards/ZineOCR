October 15, 1982  
For the last six months, I  
have travelled to all parts of the  
state listening and talking with  
Vermonters from all walks of  
life. Young and old, male and  
female, they all have deep  
concerns about the future of  
Vermont. They ask about many  
issues such as how we can  
improve the educational quality  
of our public schools, how  
better job opportunities can be  
available in all regions of the  
state, how we can protect our  
special environment and how we  
are going to bring skyrocketing  
electric rates under control.  

- There are significant differ-  
ences between me and my  
opponent. Voters do have a real  
choice on November 2nd.

DIFFERENT FROM DICK  

Nuclear Freeze — Of all the  
issues, the threat of nuclear war  
is the greatest. My opponent  
opposes Vermont's call for a  
mutual and verifiable freeze on  
nuclear weapons development.  
He also believes the crisis reloca-  
tion plan to move thousands of  
people from southern New Eng-  
land to Vermont is workable. He  

is wrong. I will continue my  
work for a nuclear weapons  
freeze and I believe a crisis  

relocation plan is unworkable  
and unwise. It is a waste of time  
and money and it serves only to  
promote the false perception  
that nuclear war is survivable.  
Environment — Protecting  
Vermont's special environment  
is one of my highest priorities.  
My opponent wants to weaken  

Act 250. I want to strengthen  
the law so we can regain our  
national leadership in protecting  
our land, water, and air resour-  
ces.  

Jobs — State development  
assistance must be targeted to  
areas in Vermont with high  
unemployment and low  
incomes. We cannot rely solely on  
a ‘big business’ industrial deve-  
lopment policy. I would place a  
greater emphasis on helping  
small business and promoting  
the agricultural sector of our  
economy.  

Education — I believe future  
state-aid increases must be  
focused on quality improve-  
ments in our public schools. My  
opponent is unwilling to make  
this commitment of resources.

Day Care — I support  
increased public funding of day  
care and will work with the  
private sector to expand child-  
care facilities and programs. I  
think the State, as the largest  
employer in Vermont, should set  
an example by including child  
care as a fringe benefit for state  
workers.  

Electric Rates — The rates  
of our two largest utilities have  
increased by 60 percent over the  
last two and one half years.  
Vermonters are struggling to pay  
these bills. I will be a pro-  
consumer governor and fight for  
the rate payer.  

As Governor, I will provide  
the new leadership, the new  
ideas, and the vision to tackle  
the problems we face. I have

tremendous faith in the ingenuity  
and creativity of the men and  
women of this State. I intend to  
put these resources to work in a  

Kunin administration.
