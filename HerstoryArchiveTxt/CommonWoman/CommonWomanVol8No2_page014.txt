Despite promises to lower government spending, the Reagan
administration is only lowering social programs spending, raising
military spending by $1.6 trillion over the next five years. If you
spent $1 million every day since the birth of Jesus, you would
only spend half that much!

Income Tax Assistance

Student volunteers from
Trinity College have been
trained to teach and prepare
taxes for low income and elderly
people. The Volunteer Income
Tax Assistance (V.I.T.A.) pro-
gram is sponsored by the I.R.S.
The volunteers are educated in
basic tax law and shown how to
fill out simple 1040s. After the
course is completed volunteers
go out into the community to
either aid individuals to prepare
their own tax forms or if they
prefer, to do it for them. Trinity
V.I.T.A. volunteers will be at the
University Mall or the Adult
Basic Education Center in
Winooski, until April 1. For
more information, call the Busi-
ness Department at Trinity
College, 658-0337, ext. 304.

Once in a Lifetime

Continued from Page 10

is the title story of the book and
the epitome of what disturbs me
about For Nights Like This One.
Covey, the main character, has a
fantasy ideal lover (which isn’t
bad, by the way, fantasies can be
fun and healthy); Covey is in the
process of coming out as a
lesbian and fantasizes that her
ideal lover says to her, “You
don't ever have to be unhappy
again, You'll never have to be
alone again. I'm going to be here
with you... You'll always be
loved.” Right and I'm the
Wizard of Oz. Aside from
equating aloneness with being
unhappy, it’s Romantic Love to
the nth degree: There, there
poor baby, I'll love you and
always protect you. I wonder if
Covey wants her lover to wipe
her ass when she shits, Covey
gets up the courage to approach
a woman at her workplace by
the end of the story and I wish
the story was longer so Covey
wouldn't look like such a naive
fool.

“We Used To Be Best
Friends” also reduces the main
character to the status of a little
girl who must be taken care of.
This time, the main character is
a single mother.

“Marisa” is a good story
without outrageously bad con-
tent.

Of course, any writer must
write what she feels, knows or
imagines but I have a hard time
with Birtha’s vision of lesbian-
ism. Why are so many of the
characters jealous, passive or
petty? Why are they so caught
up in patriarchal Romantic
Love? Don’t they focus on
anything but relationships?
“Marisa” is a refreshing change
from this as Marisa does func-
tion on a job as well as have a
relationship.) I wish there was
more blood, nerves and guts
to these stories. What Birtha
needs is more depth, height, and
breadth in her vision of what
lesbianism means; if she tapped
deeper into herself, I’m willing
to bet the stories will be there.
Really, they will.
