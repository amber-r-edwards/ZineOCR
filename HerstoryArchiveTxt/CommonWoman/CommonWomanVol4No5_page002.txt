.. COMPUTERLAND IS COMING ...

or Send My Regards to Ile,
Brother
By Linda Wittenberg

Scene: Small town Burlington,
Vermont, corner of College
St. and N. Winooski Ave.

Time: Any day 1982

Center Stage a sign says:
“Computerland is Coming.” A
woman is standing in front of
the sign but we cannot see what
she is doing.

1982 + 2 = 1984. A year I
grew up thinking about. 1984 —
I'll be 34. That seemed like a
long time away when I was 15
and it was the space age and
then the age of Aquarius. Now,
as I stand on College St. in
downtown Burlington and see
Computerland down on the
corner I realize that the Com-
puter age is here. I realize that
computer technology has acce-
lerated in the last several years,
that it’s become more visible and
that if we participate with them
(computers), appreciate them,

“become accustomed to them,

we will begin to control our
lives.

What’s a computer anyway?
It’s a machine designed to
simplify, to eliminate human
movement. Mental and physical

By Laurie Larsun
Seize structure.
Correspond with the real.
Fuse spirit and matter.
Know your own secrets,
—Muriel Rukeyser

For how many months now
has the concept of this article
brewed in my brain? To seize
structure now is for me to give
these thoughts shape. To bring
some sharable form to the
myriad conversations, and scrib-
bled scraps of notebook-
covers, margins of newspaper
clippings, etc. that have contri-
buted to my recent attitude
about reality. It has meant
creating my own reality with
more energy and passion than I
have in the past.

Be realistic, Laurie. That's
not reality. Well, that’s all fine
and good for some utopian
theorist living with her head in
the clouds, but in the real
world... you need (fill in the
blank): a board of directors; a
good husband; a compact car
with whitewall tires; a small
computer; life insurance; a war-
ranted color T.V.; pantyhose
that don’t run; financial secur-
ity; fiscal responsibility; two
children; a programmable coffee-
maker; etc. ad surrealum...

movement. Motion and emotion.
It’s a labor-saving device, like
white bread is for your teeth,
your stomach, your bowels. You
don't have to do so much
digesting. Less movement. A
computer is a digester, a pro-
cessor. You get the product
without chewing, thinking, mak-
ing mistakes (human error),
learning. It’s true I’ve seen other
movements constipated, co-opted,
destroyed, but human
movement — motion — that’s
life — the breath of the cells,
beat of the heart, flow of blood
in the veins, wings of the spirit.
Pulsation, assimilation, elimina-
tion, thinking, dreaming.
Motion. Sophisticated compu-
ters are one end result of a big
mistake — technology — cars,
airplanes, telephones; a mistake
to aspire beyond the capacities
of our bodies instead of being
inspired by them. So that today,
in an advanced technological civ-
ilization, I can only begin to glean
my own ability to project my
body and mind through time
and space. But beginning I am.

I'm sitting at Cliffside Park
on Lake Champlain — the world
around me as I write. Adiron-
dack skyline on my left, and on
my right, Computerland.

My correspondence with the
real began when? The phone call
two years ago to quit my cushy
teaching job in the suburbs? The
letter I wrote to my mother
when I came out to her? Maybe
much earlier at some point when

I realized (made real, actual-
ized) that the paths that I could
choose from were being proffered
to me by some “other” beyond
my control...
Be realistic! Do the impos-
sible!
—graffiti, Paris 1968

To begin to create a self-
definition and direction to grow
in, rather than consider the
pre-packaged options. An offer
— no taker. A choice — no
choice really. At some point,
fantasy gets acted on and visions
become the real work and play
of everyday.

Truth as fact. Columbus
discovered America, Truth as
storytelling. An anecdote: Where
I grew up in Illinois, two corn-
fields grow on the opposite sides
of a major highway. On the left

side is a field of shriveled,

1. Build a foundation.
Schools and summer camp. I’ve
been thinking about computer
technology for quite awhile, but
I knew they had really swung
into high gear when I heard
about Computer Camp. That’s
right, summer camp! Just ima-
gine it... the counselors are all
computers. How can a kid have a
crush on a counselor when she,
he, it’s a computer? There go
some of the finest breeding
grounds of lesbianism and homo-
sexuality. (And by the way,
heterosexuality isn’t far behind.
Take a look in Upton’s or any
local pinball hangout. It’s not
each other the kids are bumping
and grinding.) So at computer
camp kids will spend part of
their time learning how to
function in Computerland.
Learning how to process and be-
come processed — like good
little American cheeses.

2. Create culture. Infiltrate
language. Language is a basic
human tool of communication.
It shapes how we think, gives
our images form. We are who we
describe ourselves to be, who
we're programmed to be. I want

your input, your feedback. I
need to process what you're
saying. This doesn’t compute. A
lot of things don’t compute —
emotions, psychic ability, magic,
hysteria. Will we lose the words
to describe them, and then will
they be lost?

3. Create fascinating (seduc-
tive) paraphernalia. Take bank
cards for example. Your after
hours money card. Your key
card, your access card. A nice
card. Makes you feel like you
have a credit card. Maybe your
name (and number) is embossed
in gold. Jane Q. Citizen. What's
in it for you? Convenience. You
can get some of your money
most of the time. Nice, but is it
worth it? This system is designed
ultimately not for your conven-
ience but for your control. For
they control their access to you.
They want you as well as your
dollars in their data bank. The
bank card machine is there
because it needs perfection,
modification. It needs to have its
bugs ironed out so it can grow
up and become a social control
machine — Big Brother. You
there — with your access card —
they're training you to punch in
to Computerland.

4. Make the fascinating

Real World

HALF-and-HALF

ULTRA-PASTEURIZED

wilted, yellowed corn labeled
organic; on the right a field of
ten-foot tall, super-green butter-
crunch corn with its hybrid
number posted at regular inter-
vals. A sign proclaims the
obvious dangers of organic farm-
ing and suggests ways to get high
yields by using a certain hybrid
of corn and certain pesticides
and certain herbicides and cer-
tain irrigation equipment and
certain fertilizers and all these
wonderful products can be
obtained through three different
subsidiaries of the same corpora-

tion... They don’t mention that

the “organic” corn is dying from
the effects of the monocropping,
erosion and soil-mineral deple-
tion that these products have
already caused, necessitating the
use of more and “better”
chemicals and machinery. And
more money.

So in my life I talk about.

“real” food vs. “junk” food.
And what do I mean? What's the
difference between styrofoam-
nestled Grand Union tomatoes
wrapped in cellophane and co-op
local organic tomatoes? Between
apple-crisp and coffee cheese-
cake? Well, some of the differ-
ence is the very real differences
of PCB’s, pesticides and herbi-
cides absorbed by plants, or the
real differences of how we get
apples and maple syrup vs. how

cane-sugar and coffee-beans
come to us. And some of the
difference is the very real
difference of the attitudes

involved in the acquisition and
distribution of the food. That
means a full dumpster of vege-
tables behind the P&C, vs. a
donation to the Community
Food Shelf, a barter, a gift, a

paraphernalia impossible to do
without. Did you ever try to
rent a car without a credit
card?

5. Propagandize. The idea of
a computerized world is not a
very attractive one. So why do
people still want to buy it?
Advertising. Picture your nice
average clean-cut American
family huddled around the video
game on a sunny afternoon.
Doesn’t it look like they’re
having fun? Imagine a sexy
blonde sitting on top of your
home computer. She’s wearing a
bikini (even though it’s Jan-
uary). That’s how they sell cars.
That's how they sell chain saws.
A computer is sold as a symbol
of power. A powerless woman in
the picture makes the sale.

6. Create adult games. Atari
announces the introduction of
“adult” video games. Pornogra-
phy, remember, is a multi-
million dollar business.

7. And on the seventh day
create weapons to defend Com-
puterland against any move-
ment. Let’s not forget that the
most sophisticated, extensive
and expensive computer tech-
nology goes into weapons.

A third-world surcharge on
bananas. A smaller mark-up in
exchange for help in the store-
front. Funky homemade songs
and laughter vs. pumped muzak.
Something more is understood
when a seed is planted by hand
with a dead fish and a prayer,
than it is when planted by
machine with Ultragro 94

In the food you eat. In the
things you build. In the love you

Whose reality is it?

Seem a botanical drawing—
—from Winter Trees

by Sylvia Plath

How many times has the
sunset looked like a postcard?
Or the trees like a painting? Or
has the lake glinted like in a
movie? Or the bird seemed
to be off of a postage stamp?
Frames and margins... How
much does our art free us? Or

trap us? When does art become a
controlling factor? Does art
reflect reality or reality reflect
art? What about the “media”?

What does it mediate? Reality
