“Coming Out of Violence,”  
a videotape about battered wom-  
en, will be featured at an exclu-  
sive Vermont screening at 8:30,  
Saturday, June 23, at the Image  
Co-op in downtown Montpelier.  

Illustrating the plight of the  
abused women, the tape uses  
testimony from both battered  
women and the personnel that  
run the courts, police forces,  
hospitals and social service agen-  

cies. “It explores the experiences”  

of battered women with the  
various agencies and the insensi-  
tivities of our society towards  
them,” said Dottie Shami of  
Eggplant Media Productions,  

producers of the tape.  

Shami will screen the pro-  
duction at the Montpelier gallery  
and later discuss the issues with  
viewers. She is a member of the  
Hartford, Connecticut feminist  
media  

group and has been  
actively organizing in New Eng-  
land for several years around this  
and other feminist issues.  

Each chapter of the tape is  
divided by original music and  
photo montages, along with  
conclusions and recommenda-  
tions made by the U.S. Commis-  
sion on Civil Rights. “These  
conclusions and recommenda-  
tions are applicable to many  
similar agencies around the  
country. Hartford is not unique  
in its attitudes and procedures  
concerning battered women,”  
says Shami.  

The tape is one in a continu-  
ing series at the Image Co-op,  
a photography, film and video  
cooperative, providing resources,  
work and meeting space, and a  
downtown gallery for artists.  

A donation of $1 will be  
asked at the door.

WANTED: Childfree  
Persons Over Thirty-Five Willing  
To Be Interviewed. I would like  
to talk with people over the age  
of thirty-five who have not had  
children. More and more men  
and women are deciding to  
remain childfree, and I — along  

with other researchers — am  
trying to gather information  
about what it’s like to not raise  
children. If you yourself do not  
have children, or know of others  
who are childless, and are willing  
to be interviewed, could you  
please contact me? Thank you  
very much. ANITA LANDA, RD
