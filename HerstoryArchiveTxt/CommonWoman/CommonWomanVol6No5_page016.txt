Atomic Cafe

Reviewed by Michiyo Cornell

I found Atomic Cafe to be
as interesting for what it didn’t
say as for what it did say.
Atomic Cafe is a horrific mon-
tage of the U.S. government's
attempts to get Americans to
prepare for and accept the
inevitability of atomic war.
Equally striking throughout the
film clips (mostly, it seems,
culled from military propagan-
da) in Atomic Cafe was the
intertwining of church, state and
military authority behind the
development of the atomic and
hydrogen bombs. Over and over
clergymen, state and military
officials assured Americans (by
“American,” I mean United
States of America citizens; I
know the U.S. doesn’t cover all
of North, South and Central
America) that the bombs were
being used for “peace.” How
anyone hopes to win peace
through violence is beyond me.

I found myself wishing that
Atomic Cafe would go below the
surface horrific scenes that it
portrayed. I had a sense of the
absurd or ironic throughout the
film, but I wanted there to be
more solid substance other than
letting the military speak for
itself in the film. For instance,
the contrast between Japanese
people walking peacefully about
and the horror of destruction
that followed the A-bombing of
Hiroshima was good, but the
film didn’t go far enough.

I know the bombing not
only of Nagasaki but Hiroshima
was completely unnecessary.
The Japanese military clique
under the urging of Emperor
Hirohito had voted to surrender
to the American troops before
the U.S. demanded “uncondi-
tional surrender” and the Japan-
ese wanted one condition: to
keep Hirohito as the symbolic
power. Hirohito, through all
World War II, had no more real
power than the queen of England;
his is/was/had been for centuries
a strictly ceremonial role. Another
point was the Japanese had no
diplomatic ties to the U.S., so they
attempted to surrender through the
but the U.S. and
Russia had made an agreement
at Yalta that one could not
accept surrender from Japan
without the other. The Russians
turned the Japanese down. So
Hiroshima was bombed. After-
wards the Japanese prime minis-
ter said he had “no comment”
about the bombing of Hiro-
shima. In other words, he had no
authority to comment at that
time. American translators said
the Japanese prime minister
chose to “ignore” the bombing
and a second bomb was dropped
on Nagasaki (three days after
Hiroshima) on August 9, 1945.

This section of the film had
a sense of pornography to me.
Paul Tibbets (the bomber pilot
of Hiroshima) talked about
having coffee and “sightseeing”
after the bombing of Hiroshima.

REVIEWS

Later in the film, various mili-
tary personnel state that the
blast is “beautiful.” Other per-
sonnel talked about selecting
“virgin territory” for the
A-bombing, that is territory that
hadn’t been bombed before. The
linkup between sexuality and
violence is unavoidable for these
men. One song in the movie
makes this linkup between
sexuality and violence even more
explicit; the song lyrics state in a
gallows humor kind of way that
thirteen women and one man
were left after an A-bombing
and the man could have two
women every night. It doesn't
seem to occur to the man in the
lyrics that the women might not
want him.

So the troops come home
and the film viewer is treated to
more instances of racism and
sexism. This is one problem in
letting the military propaganda
speak for itself; much too much
depth of perception is omitted.
There is nothing to counter-
balance the film as if that was all
that happened. America is roar-
ingly happy over V-J Day:
victory in Japan day.

That, I can believe but there
is no mention of how women
were forced out of independent
jobs into the dependent role of
wife and mother. Some women
may have willingly given up their
jobs but many were forced and
guilt-tripped out of work by the
media of the time, the 1950s.
The silent generation. A forced
silence for it was the McCarthy
era of looking for Communist
spies and “fellow travelers.”

The McCarthy era is a good
example of how our government
and media (freedom of the press,
folks) can cooperate to whip up
hysteria. Russia, after World War
II, was in very bad shape. Much
of her cities were bombed out;
women outnumbered men two
to one or three to one since so
many Russian men died fighting.
Russia was reeling from the
multiple wounds of a disorgan-
ized economic and social base
with her former capitalist allies
wanting to move in for the kill.

You would never know Russia
was in such bad shape from the
U.S. propaganda. Why, the
Russkies are going to march up
to our doors and hang the
hammer and sickle on our town
halls! It was in this horror show
of political repression and xeno-
phobia that Ethel and Julius
Rosenberg were sent to their
deaths for espionage. The atmos-
phere was similar to the one that
sent Sacco and Vanzetti to their
deaths and deported many Left-
ists to the country of their
origin. And of course, lesbians
and gay men were harassed and
arrested.

There are many examples of
racism and sexism and general
disregard for human life (poor
white soldiers faced the same
risks as black and brown soldiers
did although most of the white
soldiers probably had a false
sense of white supremacy and
privilege) on the part of the U.S.
from the forcible removal of the
people who lived on the Bikini
Atoll that was used for the
fourth U.S. atomic blast through
false assurances that all one
needed to do “in the event of a
nuclear war” was build bomb
shelters and “duck and cover”
when the bomb was actually
dropped in your area.

Neither a bomb shelter nor
“duck and cover” will save you
from radiation that lasts for
hundreds of years. The ones who
die immediately would be the
lucky ones; the ones who are left
to contend with radiation sick-
ness, genetic damage in coming
generations and the general
horror of no uncontaminated
food or water are the unlucky
ones who will envy or even
choose to join the ones who
already died.

There is a lot more I could
say about details of the film over
the Korean War, inadequate
protection of the Earth, the
general public and American
soldiers from indiscriminate
nuclear testing and bombs, but
I would like to back off from that
and share some concerns of a
theoretical nature about the film
clip. The view of human nature
in these films was frightening to
say the least. All of us are white
(preferably blonde, especially
women), middle class and free in
a family with Daddy as head of
household, Mommy as servant of
Daddy and nursemaid to the one
girl and boy who will replace
Mommy and Daddy when they
get older. This, of course, is
classist, racist, sexist, ageist and
generally inhumane. What are we
free to do? Why consume, to
endlessly consume! The quantity
of goods produced is the index
of how well off American people
are, according to the film clips.
And we need our patronizing
leaders of church, state and
military to tell us what to do.
One film clip made this insult-
ingly clear: the “average man”
cannot handle the pressures of
human life and is gullible and
looking for someone to take care
of “him.”

Of course, our benevolent
leaders must step in to save us
from commies such as the older
woman who, when asked what
to do about the Korean War,
said, “Why, we should bring our
boys home. They've been gone
too long.” Much too simple and
clear for the government, church
and military leaders who make
up convoluted reasons for war
when no war exists. I agree with
the woman. Let’s bring our boys
home, forever and stop maraud-
ing the world and each other.

Present Stage

Food Fright

Food Fright, a three-woman
touring show, will open in
Northampton, Massachusetts
October 8, 9, 15, 16, 22, and 23
and is available for bookings
thereafter. Food Fright is a
collage of scenes which addresses
issues surrounding food and
body image and the ways in
which these pressures affect
women. The obsession with
thinness is explored through the
portrayal of a range of psycho-
logical and social influences. The
play examines how family
dynamics, peer group pressure
and media images contribute to
obsessive dieting patterns, often
beginning in early adolescence
and resulting in eating disorders:
anorexia nervosa and bulimia.
Food Fright is set in a cabaret
and uses humor, original songs
and music, powerful personal
narratives and statistical infor-
mation to make the show
entertaining, informative and
accessible to a broad audience.

Calamity Jane is a two-
person touring show and will
open in Northampton, Massa-
chusetts November 5, 6, 12, 13,
19 and 20 and is available
for bookings thereafter. Calamity
Jane is the tale of a remark-
able American character, told in
the words and actual accounts of
the period and in Calamity’s
own words with music and songs
of the West. Calamity tells of the
events of the time: the battle for
gold in the Black Hills of South
Dakota, the end of the frontier,
the little known role women
played in the life and building of
the West. It is also the story of
the way in which a woman
becomes transformed into a
legend in her own lifetime.

Suzanne Baxtresser, who
with director Steve Wangh, has
written this new musical play,
plays Calamity Jane. Ms. Bax-
tresser’s career includes lead
roles with New York’s Public
Theater, Reality Theater in
Boston, the Cambridge Ensem-
ble, as well as with theaters
throughout the country. Recently
she was the principal actress
in the Emmy award-winning
production, No Lies, broadcast
nationally on PBS. Calamity
Jane is the first in a series of
plays which will be created by
Ms. Baxtresser focusing on lives
of both famous and infamous
women.

Both shows are approxi-
mately one to one and a half
hours in length, have simple set
ups and minimal technical
requirements. Fees for Food
Fright and Calamity Jane are
negotiable. Contact:
