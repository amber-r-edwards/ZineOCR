CAMPAIGN OF TERROR

I am dreaming though it feels real  
the room is dark & dank  

sterile and hollow  

the TV box is speaking at me  

Gerrick Uptley nonchalantly  

relays the evening news  

atrocities violations pause/comma/smile  

assumptions exploitations pause/comma/station break  

this evening he becomes startled, anxious  
illegible script? technological difficulties?  
temporary program disruption, I assume  
the static and confusion an embarrassment  
to prime time national news  

the message he hears on the earphones  
becomes terror on his face  
maintaining his role he announces in anguish  

“it has finally happened. 10 seconds until destruction.  

we only have 10 seconds.”  

life extinguishing before my eyes  
I seek the comfort of another in vain  
to share this horrifying holocaust  

his image on the screen shows nothing  
but the knowledge of terror  

I awake in a trembling sweat  

I leave the dream of the man on the TV  
but his ghastly message lingers  

and the threat remains real  

it is real though it feels like a dream

atrocities violations when I am dreaming  
atrocities violations when I am awake  
my head falls in somber stillness  

the man in the city  
smashes my windshield  

steals my money my clothes my running shoes  
the man steals my pen — gift from a sister poet  

the man steals my books — words of  
comfort and challenge by  

wild and wise women  

my head falls . . .  

3 men drive up to me  

in a 7-11 parking lot  

one man with a Mick Jagger shirt  
extends his arm  

holds a gun in my face  

blasting blank phallic bullets  

in my face  

my ears ring with fear  

they break into boisterous laughter  
pleased with their prank  

as my ears ring with fear  

the newsprint explodes in my face  
and it is not just a dream  

to caution the working women  
at the Herstory Archives  

Lena has posted a letter of hate  
addressed to you and me  

‘4 hate fags of both sexes  

and my campaign of terror  
against you has just begun”  

in my dreams  
on the TV  

in the newspaper  
in the city  

in our homes  

in our minds  

this campaign of terror reigns  
threatening extinction  

I will no longer bow in somber stillness  
as atrocities and smiles and station breaks  
monopolize the air  

women and whales  

constantly violently endangered  

I will not bow in sorrow  

I will not collapse in acquiescence  

take my money take my clothes  
but when you take my pen and my poetry  
let it be known  
I will still sing the humpback song  
and write my own goddamn poetry  
in my own wombyn’s blood  
if I have to

Eight Vermont women reading their poetry. The seventh  
year of an annual event. I had  
attended once before, several  
years ago and finding much of it  
too tepid for my taste had not  
returned. This evening there is a  
large audience at the Fletcher  
Library and from the beginning  
a sense of motion, Something of  
a revolution in poetry reading  
here. These poets are married,  

single, third world, white, lesbian,  
divorced. Divergent world  

views converge for the listener as  
poems arranged by theme are  
spoken, a different woman each  
time. Gwen Shervington starts  
with “Never Liked the Color  
White.” The poem speaks of the  
oppressiveness of putting on a  
white dress, the impossibility,  
annoyance of trying to keep it  
clean if one is alive, moving,  
doing. White here stands for  
blandness, restriction of free-  

dom. The reference is, of course,  

racial, but I think, also, of the  

straight jacket of a wedding  
dress. Then Pat Fontaine elicits  
silence announcing “I am a  
Woman of Color,” a poem of  
affirmation, a song of herself, a  
journey through the pain of  
feeling different, marked by a  
birthmark, the efforts to change  
her moving to an acceptance of  
this color as part of herself. The  
next round of poems were all  
addressed to another in the  
poets’ lives except Nell Rose’s  
which referred to herself.  

In her book The Work of a  
Common Woman, Judy Grahn  
notes that one set of her poems  

was inspired by a production of  
Ntosake Shange’s For Colored  
Girls Who Have Considered  
Suicide When the Rainbow Is  
Enuf. Then in reading the  
introduction to Ntosake’s book  
she learns that it was inspired by  
Grahn’s Common Woman  
poems. Grahn says, “How I love  
these vital threads passed around  
among women, especially those  

of us who are expected to be  
completely split from each other  
by class, education, race, age,  
homophobia. How important  
this is, to our lives and our  
literature.” I felt the presence of  
these threads at this poetry  
reading and that was part of  
what made it such a good  
evening. Having the poems  
arranged thematically gave the  
audience a chance to draw their  
own connections. Much of the
