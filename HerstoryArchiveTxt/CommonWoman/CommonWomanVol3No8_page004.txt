Gay Issues  

Anita  

Anita Bryant has had a  
change of heart regarding some  
of the issues she was formerly so  
adamant on. “I’m more inclined  
to say, ‘live and let live, just  
don’t try to flaunt it or legalize  
it.’ I guess I can better under-  
stand the gays’ and feminists’  
anger and frustration.” She said,  
“fundamentalists have their  
heads in the sand. The church is  
sick right now and I have to say  
I’m even a part of that sickness.”  
She went on to say that “there  
are some valid reasons why  
militant feminists are doing what  
they're doing.” She still does not  
support the ERA, however.  

Pay Off  

Leonard Matlovich, the gay  
soldier kicked out of the Air  
Force for his sexual preference,  
has accepted a $160,000 settle-  
ment from the service. He said it  
was a “great victory” because by  
paying such a sum, the Air Force  
was showing it recognized that  
discrimination did take place.  
Air Force Secretary Hans Mark  
said the Air Force agreed to the  
settlement because it regards  
“homosexuality as fundamen-  
tally inconsistent with military  
service.” Matlovich agreed not to  
attempt to enlist in any branch  
of the armed services.  

Native  
Americans  

The Cayuga Indian Nation is  
asking for the return of 64,015  
acres of upstate New York land,  
the removal of 7,000 property  
owners, and $350 million in  
damages. The tribe claims land it  
sold in 1795 and 1807. The  
federal government never rati-  
fied the sale as required by a  
1790 federal law. State, federal  
and Native American officials  
negotiated a settlement which  
would have given 5,480 acres to  
the tribe for a reservation made  
of state and federal park land  
and an $8 million trust fund. The  
settlement was defeated in the  
House last March.  

The  
Environment  

Senate Waste Bills  

The Senate approved a toxic  
waste bill that would provide  
$41.6 billion over a five-year  
period for cleanup of hazardous  
waste dumps and chemical spills,  
with 88 percent of the money  
coming from the chemical indus-  
try. The bill does not provide for  
paying compensation or medical  
expenses of victims, like those of  
Love Canal, where 1,000 families  
have been forced to move since  
August 1978.  

A bill has passed the Senate  
which allows for the Federal  
government to create without  
state or local approval toxic  
chemical and radioactive waste  
sites anywhere in the country.  
Now in the House, H.R. 7418  
may come up this session. This is  
a very dangerous bill and one  
that people should be aware of.  

Agent Orange Suit Dis-  

missed  

A class action suit filed by  
hundreds of Vietnam vets was  
dismissed by the 2nd Circuit  
Court of Appeals in a 2-1  
decision. The suit claimed 5  
major manufacturers of the  
defoliant were liable for billions  
of dollars in damages because of  
birth defects caused in the  
children of those exposed. They  
were seeking to have Agent  
Orange banned and a trust fund  
for claims set up by the manu-  
facturers.  

Racism  

In what has been called a  
“green light for the Klan,” the  
all-white jury in Greensboro,  
North Carolina acquitted four  
Klan members and two Nazis in  
the shootings of 5 Communist  
Worker Party supporters. Des-  
pite the fact that experts proved  
the defendants shot first, the  
defense managed to convince the  
jurors otherwise. National Nazi  
leader Harold Covington called  
the verdict “a great victory for  
white America... It shows we can  
beat the system on their own  
ground.”  

Nuclear  

Yankee Hike  

Vermont Yankee’s rate in-  
crease is $22.6 million this year,  
almost half of which is due to  
their rising costs. Repairs and  
safety features alone at the plant  
could cost customers of Central  
Vermont Public Service Corpora-  
tion and Green Mountain Power  
$10 million. Both utilities will  
attempt to pass costs on to  
consumers.  

Subs Dumped?  

The Navy plans to sink four  
old nuke subs at sea if the  
government allows resumption  
of radioactive waste disposal in  
the ocean. The coasts of Califor-  
nia, Delaware and Hawaii are  
under consideration.  

Fast Breeder  

The male attempt at repro-  
duction, the fast-breeder nuclear  
reactor, is underway in France.  
The “Super-Phoenix” stands 250  
feet high, is 190 feet in dia-  
meter, and will hold 5,000 TONS  
of plutonium. It will cost at least  
$2.5 billion. The French plan to  
build 6 fast breeders, or one  
every three years until the end  
of the century. The Soviet  
Union also has a fast breeder.  

F.B.I.  

Two high-ranking former  
FBI agents, W. Mark Felt and  
Edward S. Miller, were found  
guilty in November of violating  
the civil rights of former Wea-  
therpeople supporters. They  
authorized illegal searches of  
homes in New York and New  
Jersey in the early 70s by failing  
to get court warrants for the  
break-ins. The four men and  
eight women were sequestered  
throughout the two-month trial.  
No sentencing date was set. Each  
man could receive up to 10 years  
in prison and a maximum  
$10,000 in fines.  

QUIBIUIE XII RIESS  

Resistance  

Pentagon Action  

An estimated 2,000 women  
demonstrated at the Pentagon  
on November 17, of whom 150  
were arrested for blocking  
entrance to the national military  
headquarters. Most were released  
on $25 bonds pending trials later  
this month. The protest was the  
culmination of a two-day event  
that covered different parts of  
Washington, including Arlington  
Cemetery where the women  
expressed mourning for women  
who have been victims of male  
violence.  

Woman Speaks Up  

A woman Roman Catholic  
youth leader confronted Pope  
John Paul II on November 19  
about “too many prohibitions”  
in church dogma on sex, and the  
Vatican’s proscribed role for  
women. Barbara Engl, 29, said  
that young people were alienat-  
ed from the church “because it  
clings fearfully to the status  
quo” on matters of sex and sex  
roles. An audience of a half a  
million watched as she denoun-  
ced church rigidity. The 60-year  
old man sat with bowed head  
and clasped hands and did not  
respond.  

Health  

Caffeine  

The Food and Drug Admin-  
istration has advised that preg-  
nant women should limit the  
amount of caffeine they con-  
sume. Caffeine has been linked  
in tests with rats and mice to a  
high rate of birth defects. March  
of Dimes advises women to have  
less than 6 cups per day, but  
even that is probably too much.  

Birth Control  

Ireland has a new birth  
control law. Contraceptives will  
now be legal, but only for  
married couples. Hundreds of  
women and men swamped illegal  
family planning clinics before  
the new bill went into effect,  
trying to get devices that will  
now be regulated.

Washington State Action  

Also on Monday, November  
17, 21 people, mostly women,  
were arrested after chaining  
themselves to the gate of a new  
$12 million Mormon temple, in  
Bellevue, Washington. They were  
protesting the Mormon church’s  
opposition to the ERA. Police  
used bolt cutters to cut chains  
and wires that had held some of  
the protesters since Saturday  
night. Witnesses said some were  
pushed to the ground by on-  
lookers. One woman filed a  
complaint with police against a  
man who allegedly pushed her to  
the ground and kicked her in the  
side.  

Among those present was  
Sonia Johrison, the ex-Mormon  
who was kicked out of the  
Mormon church for her support  
of the ERA. She was sentenced  
to 90 days and fined $250, the  
jail term being deferred as long  
as she does not go near the new  
temple. “That remains to be  
seen,” said Johnson.  

Issues  

Blame “Lib”  

“Women’s Lib” is getting  
the blame for the increase in  
oral cancer among women in this  
country. Doctors and scientists  
claim that women drink too  
much, smoke too much and sun  
themselves too much because of  
feminism. We've come a long  
way, baby.  

Midwifery  

A 29-year-old Lincoln  
woman has pleaded innocent to  
two counts of practicing medi-  
cine without a license. Carol A.  
Warnock was midwife to Mary  
Appelt who gave birth to her  
second child on October 7.  
When she began hemorrhaging,  
her husband called Warnock who  
came to the house and inocu-  
lated her with Ergotrate and  
Pitocin. John Appelt made his  
statement without realizing that  
actions constituted  
practicing without a license.  

In recent months, the state  
Board of Medical Examiners has  
been growing more vigilant of  
the midwives’ challenge to doc-  
tors.
