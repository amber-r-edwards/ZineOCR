Burlington  
Sustaining  
Fund  

A new fundraising idea has  
come to town. The Burlington  
Sustaining Fund, which hopes to  
raise money for social change  
groups not funded by United  
Way, is now holding meetings to  
determine methods of fund-  
raising and ways to connect  

disparate groups which are all  
working to change society.  

The BSF got off the ground  
at a “kickoff day” held October  
20 at the Warehouse in Burling-  
ton. A coordinating committee  
consisting of Stephen Cram, Bill  
Davis, Greg Guma, Joy Nelson,  
Julie Orvis and Jo Schneiderman  
presented its ideas to about 20  
representatives from social  
change groups and asked the  
representatives to contribute  
their own thoughts. During the  
kickoff day, two working com-  
mittees were formed to continue  
making plans: the committees  

Burlington  
Sustaining  
Fund  

are the Social Change Network  
Committee, which will discuss  
ways of facilitating communica-  
tion between various social  
change groups, and the Fund-  
raising Committee, which hopes  
to come up with ways to bring  
in money.  

New people joining the  
Sustaining Fund during the  
kickoff day included Kelly Cul-  
linn, Betsy Gentille-Higgins,  
Helen Keith, Pat Metevier,  
Michael Monte, Roberta Strauss  
and Michelle Weiss.  

“What we have to do right  
now is define what we mean by  
social change and define the  
responsibilities and demands of  
our recipient groups,” says Julie  
Orvis. “We hope to concentrate  
on raising large amounts of  
funds from people who have  
large amounts of money. Indivi-  
dual recipient groups would still  
be encouraged to hold their own  
benefits to raise smaller amounts  
of money and to sustain com-  
munity spirit.”  

The Burlington Sustaining  
Fund’s next meeting will be held  
Saturday, December 15, at 10  
a.m., at the offices of the  
Vermont Vanguard, 95 College  
St., Burlington. Interested peo-  
ple are invited to attend.  

The Boys Got Us  
into this Mess  

By Joyce Cheney  

Seventy-five lesbians from  
six states attended a DONT  
(Dykes Oppose Nuclear Techno-  
logy) conference held in New  
York City on October 27. The  
group held workshops on non-  
violence, tactic or way of life;  
sexism and homophobia in the  
anti-nuke movement; dealing  
with interpersonal relationships  
within political groups; dealing  
with our racism and classism;  
foods to combat radiation.  

DONT lesbians carried their  
lavender banner to the legal  
no-nukes rally at the World  
Trade Center October 28; and,  
on October 29, attended the  
demonstration at Wall Street,  
where several of them were  
arrested while attempting to  
close down the stock exchange.  

The boys — once again —  
got us in this mess. To quote  
FANG (Feminists Against Nukes  
Group, Philadelphia, Pa): “Are  
nukes masculine? We live in a  
male-dominated society: a pat-  
riarchy. Under patriarchy, men  
and women are channeled in  
different directions. Men are  
trained to run the world, to be  

cool and task-oriented. Women  
are taught to keep things run-  
ning, nurture men and children,  
so men are free to do ‘impor-  
tant’ things. This separates the  
thinkers from the carers, the  
power from the nurturing, the  
decision-makers from life.  
Nuclear power is a product of  
the patriarchy and of its econo-  
my which puts profit before  
people’s needs. In order to build  
machines which are life-threaten-  
ing, it is necessary to ‘forget’  
that [we] care about life.”  

Dykes have not forgotten.  
As we have little investment in  
male society, we can afford the  
clarity of life-affirmation,  
though that means rejection of  
aspects of society which most  
people still hold as privileges,  
comforts, truths, necessities. We  
still care about life. DONT  
womyn arrested in previous  
anti-nuke actions say that half of  
the womyn arrested are dykes.  

Valuable parts of the week-  
end included 1) the visible show  
of specifically dyke presence at

Abortion Rights  

By Abby Hale  

The week of October 21-28  
was National Abortion Rights  
Action Week. All across the  
country a wide variety of groups  
organized to bring attention to  
the increasing repression and  
erosion of abortion rights.  

In Burlington, the Vermont  
Women’s Health Center held an  
open house, with the public  
invited to see and demystify an  
“abortion clinic.” Tours were  
given of the building, and Health  
Center staff members were there  
to discuss state legislative issues,  
reproductive control politics,  
Health Center services and more.  
Attendance was good and as  
varied as are the supporters of  
abortion rights.  

On Sunday, October 28, a  
more assertive action was taken.  
In spite of the miserable  
rain/snow day, about 20 women,  
several children and one man  
picketed the Catholic Diocese  
Cathedral on Pearl St. It was a  
spirited demonstration with  
energy generated by the satisfac-  
tion of directing action and  
anger at one of the most active  
anti-abortion forces. In spite of  
“laws” separating church and  
state, the Catholic Church has  
collected money in church ser-  
vices for anti-abortion actions,  
and, with its tax-free status, has  
used its organizational structure  
to rally support for letter writing  
campaigns and more. In this  
country, the Catholic Church's  

politicking is necessary to pro-  
mote the church’s misogyny, but  
in predominantly Catholic coun-  
tries (especially South and Cen-  
tral America) the church's anti-  
birth-control and anti-abortion  
positions are followed like dog-  
ma, promoting machismo and  
the enslavement of women’s  
bodies.  

It is important to remember  
that abortion rights is not an  
isolated issue — that it is part of  
a broader issue of reproductive  
control and the right of women  
to ultimately control their own  
bodies in all spheres. The people  
who favor repressive and pater-  
nalistic laws about abortion  
are the same ones who want  
compulsory sterilization for  
Third World and poor women,  
and restrictive laws for homo-  
sexuals. They are also generally  
opposed to anything that helps  
women choose to have children  
outside of traditional nuclear  
families. They would deny the  
right to artificial insemination  
for a single woman (especially a  
lesbian) and give no subsidies for  
childcare or welfare.  

Demonstrators at the chur-  
ch maintained their energy with  
assertive confrontation. Some  
women started off in the church  
and were promptly told to leave.  
No one was prepared to get  
arrested, so people stayed on the  
sidewalk displaying their signs.  
Appropriately, there was no  

ANTI ~  
NUKE  

RALLIES  

By Nancy Powell  

People just don’t like bad  
news, and that must be why  
only the already converted come  
to anti-nuke/disarmament rallies.  
The one in Washington, D.C., on  
October 13, sponsored by the  
Women's Strike for Peace, was  
attended by a small crowd of  
perhaps 400. Although the town  
was full of thousands of lesbians  
and gay men who had come for  
the March for Gay Rights the  
next day, relatively few were at  
the rally.  

Many people still do not  
perceive nuclear power as similar  
in origin to homophobia. That  
is, the patriarchy hates homo-  
sexuality because it threatens  
the nuclear family which keeps  
men’s power stable. In like  
manner, the patriarchy, in its  
indifference to life, has created  
the rapist-energy of (radiation-  
ejaculating) nuclear power. None  
of the speakers at the rally made  
this connection either.  

The overwhelming threat of  
nuclear weapons was the theme  
of the day. Speakers called for  
an end to the arms race in this  
“year of the child.” Dr. Helen  
Caldicott spoke angrily of her  
rage at a technocracy which has  
placed the earth in danger of  
imminent destruction. She said  
that the nature of the arms race  
will change radically in two  
years if the MX cruise missile is  
installed. This deadly phallic  
projection flies too low to the  
ground to be clearly detected  
and will set a hair trigger to the  
Soviet defense operation.  
Nuclear war will be, according to  
Caldicott, inevitable in another  
two years, scheduled to be deployed.  

Other speakers noted that  
50,000 nuclear weapons

our  

respect for the church — signs  
read “Abort the Pope,” “If men  
became pregnant, abortion would  
be a sacrament,” “Keep your morals off my body,”  
“Abortion is a woman’s right,”  
“We demand the right to control  
our bodies.” As the services  
ended, people again went to the  
front of the church to talk and  
be more visible. With a gentle  
voice and true Christian spirit,  
the Monsignor called the cops,  
and some women were actually  
manhandled by tougher types  
wearing aprons who seemed  
unable to stand the sight of  
strong women.  

No charges were pressed by  
either side, but the demonstra-  
tors left stronger for having  
expressed their rage and seeing  
how truly threatening it is!
