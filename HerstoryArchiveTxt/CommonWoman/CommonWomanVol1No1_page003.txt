Criminal Code

Reform Act

By Pamela J. Greene

Two years ago the Senate's  
Criminal Codification Bill, S.1,  
was killed following swift and  
massive public opposition by  
civil libertarians. Today, S.  
1437/H.R. 6869, often referred  
to as the Son of S.1 because it  
contains so many of the dangers  
and restrictions of the original  
bill, has passed through the  
Senate and is being considered  
by a House Judicial  
Subcommittee. Attorney  
General Griffin Bell is pushing  
for quick passage through the  
House, but a stormy debate is  
rising with Congresswoman  

‘cont.

Bill of  
Rights?

by someone “not the spouse.”  
“Spouse” includes non-married  
couples living together and  
married couples separated  
without judicial decree.

In addition, although the  
prior or subsequent sexual  
behavior of a rape victim is  
eliminated as grounds for  
testimony, an exception  
included “as otherwise required  
by the Constitution,” disclaims  
this, and essentially nullifies the  
first provision.

It doesn’t look good. Most  
people are confused by the  
changing numbers of the bill.  
Rumors fly that it has been  
defeated, or amended. It has  
not been defeated and is  
unamendable. But there are  
protests. A counter-bill H.R.  
1066 urges the House Judiciary  
Committee to “disapprove  
H.R. 1437 and to conduct full and  
complete hearings regarding the  
revision of the Federal Criminal  
Code.” This bill has 15 sponsors,  
and needs more.

The Judiciary Committee is  
expected to report H.R. 6869 to  

the House floor before  
mid-August. It could be passed  
before the October  
Adjournment.

There’s not much time. Write  
to Sen. Jeffords, who has  
remained “on the fence” as  
always, to oppose H.R. 6869, and  
to support H.R. 1966. For more

Sections 1001-1003  

significantly broaden the  
definition of conspiracy so that  
individuals who participate in  
group political activity could be  
held liable for the offenses of a  

few members or an agent  
provocateur. This kind of  
harassment or prosecution has a  
chilling effect on legitimate  
political expression.

Section 1115 outlaws  

picketing before an armed forces  
recruitment center and makes  

encouraging draft resistance  
illegal.

Section 1302 prohibits  
demonstrations at federal  

facilities and “interference” with  
any federal function. The broad  
language of this section could be  
used to interpret an influx of  
cars carrying demonstrators as  

illegal and subject to  
prosecution. Government  
employees' unions could be  
particularly affected by this  
section.

Section 1328 prohibits  

picketing, parading, displaying a  
sign, using a sound amplifying  
device, or otherwise  
demonstrating within 100 feet  
of a Federal courthouse while  
judicial proceedings are in  
progress or when the building is  
occupied by a judicial official.  
Feminist protests would be  
especially vulnerable to this  
section as many of the crucial  
battles of the women’s  
movement, concerning rape,  
reproductive choice, pregnancy,  
disability, and economic and  
employment discrimination, are  
being currently fought in the  
courts.

Section 1343 gives federal law  
enforcement personnel,  
including the FBI, powers of  
prosecution where the agent's  

word is taken against the  
citizen's with no oath, no  
witness corroboration and no  

presence of counsel required.  
Section 1521 broadens the  
legality of mail interference and  
wiretaps by federal authorities.  
Section 1641 defines rape as  
being committed by someone  
“not the spouse” of the victim,  
making spouses completely  
immune from prosecution for

“The Press Is Free  

as long as you own one”  

By Virginia Page  

The press is not loved.  

Surveys after surveys show  
that the public disdains and  
distrusts the daily press while  
placing a bit more faith in Walter  
Cronkite and other electronic  
father figures. The credibility of  
the printed word has taken  
second place to the persuasion  
of real people in television  
pictures, however edited and  
distorted their spoken words.

The unlovability of the press  
is generally attributed to its  

propensity for bearing bad  
tidings. “Why don’t you ever  
print good news?” readers  
constantly ask editors. The  
answer is obvious: if editors  
followed such logic, they would  
fill their papers with stories  
about dogs who did not bite  
children, houses that did not  
burn down, bombs that did not  
get thrown or dropped,  
passersby who were not mugged,  
taxes that are not unjustly  
imposed, FBI and CIA agents  
who did not tap telephones, and  
women who earned equal pay,  
or who were not raped.

Reactionaries and some  
government people hate the  
press for slightly different  
reasons. They so esteem this  
country’s prevailing social values  
of capitalism and patriarchy that  
any news dug up that discredits  
the system is considered  
destructive, disloyal and  
ill-mannered.

The Agnew-Nixon strain of  
press hatred lives on in the U.S.  
Supreme Court, which has  
recently handed down various  
decisions that may cement the  
already close partnership  
between the press and the  
government. For example, under  
a new search warrant ruling, the  
police can burst into a  
newsroom, dig through  
reporters’ notes, and discover  
the identity of any source who  
had tipped off the paper about  

police corruption.

Ironically, the press has  
already made itself the  
handmaiden of the police, the  

government, and the major  
economic powers in this  
country. Press releases from  

nuclear power corporations have  
a far better chance of being  
printed in most newspapers than  
press releases from the Clamshell  
Alliance. The arguments of  
Pacifists get little coverage  
compared to the screams and  

alarums sounded by Defense  
Department hawks and red  
baiters. Garden club notes on  
“women’s pages” far outnumber  
stories about feminist issues.  
This country’s prevailing  
social theories or dogmas are  
almost never challenged by the  
daily press, whether liberal or  
conservative. Their news stories  
are couched in Adam Smith's  
capitalistic theories in the same  

way that the Vatican's  
newspaper, L’Osservatore  
Romano, writes from the  

perspective of church theology.

And yet the American press  
prides itself on being “objective”  
as well as “free,” which is one of  

the most peculiar intellectual  
delusions of our era.  
Like most myths,  

“objectivity” serves a practical  
use for certain people. It permits  
journalists to wash their hands  
of the blood, or to avoid making  
moral judgment — even when  
reporting about threats to the  
survival of the human species,  
such as the nuclear arms race,  
pending environmental  
catastrophe, and the epidemic of  
cancer that is accompanying  
industrial development.  
“Objectivity” is just another  
word for “amorality” because it  
requires the press to treat both  
evil and innocence equally. This  
logic of objectivity was carried  
ad absurdum by a former editor  
of mine, who insisted that I  
report the name of a rape victim.  
He said that it would be  
“unfair” to the rapist not to  
spread the painful notoriety and  
embarrassment equally between  
victim and attacker. I disagreed  
and lost my job.

Another important use of  
objectivity is that it has  
relegated only to publishers and  
editors the right to mold public  
opinion. Lowly reporters are  
forbidden to permit their own  
opinions to surface in their news  
reports. In practice, however,  
this means that a reporter's  
opinions may guide the story if  
they coincide with the “editorial  
policy” of the paper, but must  
be suppressed if the reporter's  
opinions differ from that policy.  
My bias against nuclear power  
was quite apparent in the stories  
I wrote, but that was acceptable  
because the paper’s editorial  
policy was anti-nuclear. But if an  
editor is opposed to publicizing  
certain issues, such as feminist  
issues, strike issues, and the  
absurdities of the  
medical-industrial complex, a  
reporter who does want to cover  
those stories is likely to be  
forbidden to do so.

Reporters who are obligated  
to be “objective” are in a plight  
similar to that of automotive  
assembly line workers. In the  
past, those workers might have  
been blacksmiths who designed  
and built entire carriages. But  
their knowledge and  
craftsmanship was stolen from  
them during the industrial-corporate  
revolution. Similarly, news  
reporters’ right to make a  
judgment about a public issue,  
to take a moral stand, and to  
affect public opinion was stolen  
from them by corporate  
journalism. Tom Paine would  
have found it awfully hard to get  
into print in 1978, except in an  
“alternative” newspaper.

The fact is that “objectivity”  
does not exist any more than the  
“free market” exists. No  
journalist is without an opinion;  
to be neutral is to be dead. But  
only the opinions of the editor  
and publisher get into print.  
Often reporters share those  
opinions, and the newsroom is  
quiet. On other occasions, they  
disagree, and there is hell to pay.

Some of my former colleagues  
wanted the paper to endorse  
Presidential candidate Fred  
Harris in 1976, but the editor  
was enthusiastic about Jimmy  
Carter, and wrote an editorial  
supporting him. My colleagues  
said they would take an ad out  
in the paper announcing that the  
reporters disagreed with the  
editor's endorsement of Carter.  
The editor said that the  
reporters would be fired  
immediately if they took out  
such an ad. Editors and  

publishers own the First  
Amendment.

Reporters on daily  
newspapers are generally  

underpaid, overworked, and  
bossed about, which can give
