Sandy Baird on Juvenile Court

By Peggy Luns

Commonwoman:  
What is your job?

Sandy Baird: I am a deputy  
State’s Attorney and my specia-  
lty is prosecuting juvenile cases.  
I'm the only person in the office  
who does it and it is the most  
interesting part of my job.

CW: What does prosecuting  
juveniles entail?

SB: Well, any kid under 16  
is classified as a juvenile. Be-  
tween the ages of 16 and 18  
they can go either to juvenile or  
adult court. In juvenile court the  
state acts in loco parentis; that is  
in place of the parents. I also  
deal with children in need of  
care and support and neglected,  
battered or unmanageable child-  
ren.

CW: How does the court  
define a neglected child?

SB: That is the hardest  
category to prove and that’s  
where the most abuse of state  
power occurs.

CW: Would you elaborate  
on that?

SB: The court is supposed  
to act in loco parentis and  
provide the best environment for  
the child, which sounds good,  
but who defines the best envi-  
ronment? That's where the prob-  
lem comes in. We're dealing with  
mostly poor women and the  
court is middle-class white men.  
The definition of the  
interest of the children varies  
with the national mood. The  
current mood is towards the  
therapeutic state, meaning that  
social workers with therapeutic  
backgrounds tend to define what  

best -  
good parenting is without looking  
at or being aware of the  
economic context of the families  
involved. They are becoming  
quicker and quicker to take kids  
away from parents and place  
them in some more sterile  
environment like a born-again  
Christian foster home.

CW: And you object to  
this?  
SB: The law says that  
biological ties are the ones that  
should be honored. I feel that  
my first obligation is to keep  
kids at home and out of state  
hands. The right to reproduce is  
pretty basic.

I want to say here that  
when we talk about family it  
really means women and child-  
ren, because that’s who it is  
most of the time. The poor  
family is basically a matriarchy  
because lower-class men don’t  

serve much purpose if they  
can’t be breadwinners. What  
happens in the case of welfare is  
that the state marries the wom-  
an, provides support, etc. Then  
it tells her how to do her job and  
the woman can’t just argue  
with the state the way she could  
a husband because the state isn’t  
human. It has the power of  
police and courts to back it.

CW: Feminists have made  
the analysis that the family is a  
building block of the state and  
prepares the way for more  
oppression, but you are saying  
that the state is less and less  
preserving the family and more  
and more taking it upon itself to  
define an environment for the  

child.

SB: Yes, and I think we’ve  
got to ask why and question the  
equation of state supports fam-  
ily; family supports state. We  
need to ask why the state would  
rather marry the woman or  
break up biological families. I  
think at least part of the reason  
is that they don’t trust poor  
people, and those are very much  
women, to run their own lives  
and want to impose their mid-  
dle-class values on them.

CW: I take it for granted  
that sexism is everywhere. How  
does it work in juvenile court?

SB: A woman is supposed  
to bring up children according to  
male and therapy defined stan-  
dards with no money or power  
of her own, and if the kids are  
problems it is the mother who is  
responsible, and if anyone suc-  
ceeds there is no credit given  
her. The state doesn't recognize  
the economic problem and the  
therapeutic state sees the prob-  
lem in terms of how good the  
relationship is. If you're poor  
and live in one room with three  
kids it’s going to drive you  
bananas, but, instead of looking  
at that situation, what happens  
is a social worker goes in and  
says the mother is having a  
problem with her relationship to  
her children and lacks parenting  
skills. Now if that woman was  
given more money and space it  
might solve her relationship  
problem. But therapy doesn’t  
look at the context of people's  
lives, particularly in terms of  
money, and the state will take a  

child away from a mother before  
it gives her money to solve some  
of her problems. Of course the  
court has no power to give out  
money, but it does enforce its  
standards of parenting without  
regard to economics and will  
send a child to a foster home in  
which the foster parents are  
given more money to raise a  
child than its own mother, on  
welfare, would be given.

CW: I would guess deciding  
how children should be raised  
gives the state more power than  
is in the statutes. Isn’t this  
dangerous?

SB: Yes, because therapy  
does not have a political con-  
text. It only sees you have  
problems defined by its own  
impossible standards. It blames  
the victim. The law says it’s not  
up to the court to provide a  
perfect environment. The  
mother has to be adequate, but  
the therapeutic state says you  
must do it their way by their  
impossible standards on your  
impossible income or lose your  
child. It’s anti-poor, anti-woman  
and colossally middle-class.

CW: What about an abused  
child?

SB: Some children need to  
be taken from their parents,  
though I would say almost never  
in a preliminary hearing. Most  
kids want to be with their  
natural parents no matter what.  
There is also sexism in the lesser  
concern for the battered mother  
or wife and not enough concern  
for why the abuse happens.

Again there is a failure to look at  
how economic pressure makes  
people behave.

CW: What kind of solutions  
would you see?

SB: There is one simple  
solution — give people money.  
But our society says if you're  
poor you're defective, you have  
a problem and shouldn’t have  
kids. Racist attitudes also pre-  
vail. Large numbers of the poor  
are black or brown. The state  
doesn't trust poor people, espec-  
ially women. The therapeutic  
state with its pretense of provid-  
ing help really makes even more  
inroads into deciding what peo-  
ple’s values will be and I think  
women have reason to be  
concerned about the direction  

things are taking.
