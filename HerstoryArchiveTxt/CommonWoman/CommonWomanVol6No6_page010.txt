Many thousands of years
ago, before people exchanged
people for things, before people
used people as if they were
things, before paternity was
known to have anything to do
with creation, people lived joy-

Wimmin worked together
while they sang beautiful melo-
dies. Wimmin laughed together
and felt sorrow together know-
ing that the sorrow would pass
and change into joy as the moon
changed from New to full every
month. Wimmin danced and
made love together under the
full moon, in forests, on plains,
on mountain tops, in womblike

caves. They lived their lives in

perfect love and perfect trust.
And so mote it be.

Wimmin gave birth to wim-
min who gave birth to wimmin
who gave birth to wimmin.
Wimmin saw themselves as crea-
tors and saw in all of nature the
female principle: female cats
having litters, female birds laying
eggs, trees bearing fruit, flowers
blooming, indeed the whole
earth appeared feminine,
womanlike, and the Goddess was
seen in all and was all. Wimmin
rejoiced in creation which was of
them and they a part of it.

Wimmin, however, also gave
birth to sons. Wimmin loved
their sons and their sons loved
their mothers. Their sons loved
all of nature and celebrated the
female principle, the Goddess.
But, their sons were not wimmin
and felt insecure because they
could not be part of the cycle of
creation which all wimmin were.
They felt less than wimmin and
sad and hurt and deprived of
their wimminhood, their place in
the cycles. They were spun from
the spiral dance but could not
spin themselves. They were
jealous of wimmin's powers and
this jealousy simmered for hun-
dreds and thousands of years.

Wimmin, however, were not
aware of these feelings in their
sons because that jealousy was
foreign to them and their sons
were too ashamed of these
feelings to tell their mothers or
sisters or even brothers about
them.

Wimmin made pottery and cared for their

children. Men created what they
could but still felt their empti-
ness. They tried harder to create
things due to their inability to
create life and cycles.

Then, one day while a son
was out watching sheep as he
had done for 144 moons, he
all of a sudden realized that the
male sheep was a part of crea-
tion! When there were not rams
in the flock — no lambs were
born! He thought and remem-
bered how rams rode ewes and
then and only if this happened
would ewes give birth to other
lambs. He was at first excited.
He felt reprieved. He felt the
emptiness of his maleness ebb.
He felt a part of the female
principle and saw the Goddess in
himself. He told a brother about
his discovery and they talked
long into the night, relieving
their fears and emptiness and
exchanging their mutual anxie-
ties over the new revelation.
They talked so intensely that
they totally forgot that it
was both the night of the full
moon and the great Winter
Solstice celebrations.

On returning from the pas-
ture the next morning they
realized their oversight. They
felt an ugly, terrible, newly
different feeling — guilt. They
had made such a big discovery
that they felt resentful to their
mothers who wondered why

they had missed the celebra-
tions. The wimmin did not
understand what could deter
their sons from celebrating the
Goddess, indeed to forget the
Goddess entirely short of mortal
death. Wimmin, knowing they
did not understand ego.

The sons told other sons
who told other sons who told
other sons, till all the men knew
that they had something to do
with creation. They all felt
resentment toward the wimmin.
They felt “in the know.”

One day a womyn overheard some men talking in the
pasture. The men talked with
voices filled with a tone she had
never heard before. She didn't
understand. They talked with
unnatural intonations. Their talk
was like the wind — strong, but
without the wind’s gentleness. It
was like fire which destroys but
it did not give off warmth. Their
talk was like snow — cold and
biting but this snow was not soft
nor sparkling. It was like the
earth without water, without
life. She felt a feeling she had
only felt a few times in her life,
a feeling she had felt when a
rabid wolf entered the village
unseen and nearly bit her
mother before her sister’s arrow
pierced its heart.

But she had never felt this
feeling toward her sisters or
mothers or brothers before. She
hesitated and then dismissed
these strange feelings, for after
all, these were her brothers, her
mothers’ children, just as she
was — in perfect love and perfect
trust.

She emerged from her place
at the edge of the pasture — the
men started — again she felt the
presence of the rabid wolf. She
felt confused, but shameful.
Shameful because her feelings
toward her brothers were not in
perfect trust.

They raped her.

ANCIENT REMEMBERINGS | DOUBLE-EDGED

By Robin Devine

She had driven all day and
well into the night hoping to get
there without having to stop for
sleep. But now, her car veered
on and off the road. She could
not keep her eyes open any
longer and knew that she must
stop.

“For sleep,” she thought.
“If only I could keep my ears
awake to listen for sounds while
the rest of my body slept.”

She turned off the main
drive onto a narrow dirt road.
The road led to a field at the
forest's edge. Having chosen a
place and knowing that sleep
was next to come, she suddenly
felt wide awake. Her eyes
strained to see movement
around her, and saw none except
the swaying of tall grasses and
branches. She listened deep into
the night — a bard owl, a whip-
poorwill, the rustling of leaves
caused by the wind. And then a
branch snapped. She froze. Her
senses alerted to the snap. She
listened hard, glared into the
night and felt the wind move
around her body. She heard
nothing more. “A small animal
or the wind,” she reasoned,
turning her attention to the
blanket in her car.

She looked up to the sky
and winked at the small sliver of
the moon. The moon said,
“You'll be fine. I’m watching
you and sending you strength,”
and gently kissed her on the
cheek.

She smiled at the moon and
sent her another wink and a kiss.
She felt a calm spread through-
out her sleepy self. “But I’ll
sleep with my clothes on and
feel a bit safer,” she thought.
The earth gave comfort to her
and she snuggled under the
warmth of a wool blanket. She
listened to the sounds of the
night but sleep soon came and
she hoped for pleasant dreams.

The cold had awakened her.
She groped for her blanket and

realized it was gone. The figure
of a man stood over her.

Her body stiffened with
fear. Her heart raced, pounding
against her chest looking for an
escape. She had time to breathe
deeply twice before he was upon
her, undoing her belt, her pants
and pulling them down to her
thighs. He unzipped his own
pants and fought his way
between her legs.

She wrapped one arm
around his back, holding him
close to her.

“Like it, huh?” he grunted.

She groaned. Her other arm
reached down to her belt. The
buckle. She found the buckle
and easily slid it loose, exposing
a double-edged knife that had
been hidden inside the belt. She
firmly gripped the buckle that
doubled as the handle of the
knife.

He thrust at her and missed.
He rose slightly to better his
position upon her. She placed
her weaponed hand between him
and herself, the tip of the knife
at his heart. With the arm
around his back, she fiercely
pulled him closer to her.

He offered no resistance and
fell on top of her. She twisted
the blade back and forth and
warm blood oozed onto her
hand. He groaned for a second
and then was silent... The weight
of his body rested heavily on
her. With her hand still gripping
the buckle, she pushed him off.
She yanked the knife out.

“You fucker,” she said
through gritted teeth, and spat
on his face. She wiped the blood
from her hand and knife on his
shirt. Dressing herself, she put
the knife in its sheath and the
buckle back on the belt.

After picking up her blanket
she gazed up to the moon. She
winked and cracked a faint
smile. The moon smiled back.
She then got into her car and
drove until daybreak.

Dear Editors:
I would like to submit the

enclosed manuscript, “A Lesbian
Speaks to Her Straight Friend,”
for publication. With lesbians strug-
gling against the destruction of the
New Right and the “Moderate
Middle,” we need to reaffirm the
nurturing and magical aspects of
relating intimately with women. This
article is my attempt to affirm that
self-love, and to communicate to
straight women, specifically friends. I
hope your readers will enjoy it and
relate to it. Even more, I hope they
will pull this letter out of your
publication, and send it to straight
friends and family of their own.

Sincerely,

Linda M. Waite

My Friend,

Perhaps since we last talked,
you've had a chance to start to
learn about lesbians and our
lifestyles. You may have realized
that we (the vast majority of us)
bond on affectional levels to
depths much more lasting and
important than those reached
through a good orgasm or a
romantic night in front of the
fireplace. It is that depth of
connection, that level of what a
few of us call “being reached,”
that drew me to women and
keeps me celebrating the day I
finally allowed myself this joy.
It is the journey into the depth
of that other person, and the
opening up that comes with
letting myself be reached on
these levels, that is the essence
of my partnership with Judy. We
work hard, and have grown
tremendously as an “us.” I
am learning to build an “us”
that also includes and is depen-
dent on building “Linda” and
building “Judy.”

The experience of “being
reached” and of reaching into
that other person is like the door
to the power and magnificence I
feel inside me. The love and joy
I am privileged to exchange with
Judy is the most positive,
powerful part of me — it is “me”
at my best. That best has been
reached after conquering the
self-hate and negative socializa-
tion that told me that being a
lesbian, that committing my life
and love to women and to
another woman, is sick, dis-
gusting, criminal and destructive.

You've told me that you're
sick of hearing about my les-
bianism. Since I usually talk
with you about my relationship
with Judy and my job, I am left
to assume that any reference to
Judy is a reference to lesbianism.
The thought of having my love,
sharing, joy, fighting, learning,
building, and harmony with
Judy implicitly reduced to the
act of FUCKING (as though
lesbianism referred only to sex
and who shared my bed, and had
nothing to do with affection and
who shares my life) is so repul-
sive to me that I can hardly do
my own anger justice. Reducing
my existence and my relation-
ship with my lover to merely
sex, is inaccurate, if not incre-
dible.

When I say I’m a lesbian, I
am owning the very best parts of
me; I am reclaiming my power as
a human being and as a woman.
I am risking a lot to put the best
I've got out there. Identifying
myself as a lesbian is like putting
my finger deep inside me to the
very source of my power and
holding it there, to conduct that
power up out of me into the
world. It makes me feel good
and strong. I feel like I’m freeing
myself over and over again from
the bonds of my own self-hate,
and from the bonds of society's
prejudice and destruction. I live
in a world that attempts to
destroy my people (and literally
does), a world that is blatantly,
frustratingly, oppressively

see women presented together
on TV, for example, where there
is not an implicit or explicit
affiliation with men — women
either camping with men, or
doing their laundry, or dressing
up for them, or anguishing over
affairs with them? It is infuriat-
ing when we lesbians are called
“blatant,” and suffer physical or
verbal violence for simply hold-
ing hands while walking to the
store, while heterosexuals can
hang on each other, kiss in
public, and have intercourse in
cars and public parks. It all
makes me very angry. In some
ways, though, anger is necessary
for my survival.

This is not a phase or a
“stage” or a “trip,” and I resent
my life, my relationship with
Judy, and my power being
labeled as such. What I ask
from you is what I've asked of
my parents — that you love me
as I am, accept my lover into
your home with the same
hospitality that you accept the
partner of any of your other
friends or relatives, and read
“Loving Someone Gay” and
“Sappho was a Right-On
Woman.”

It's important to me not to
have to hide my life and love,
and not to have to feel like a
freak with my friends. The
world makes it very clear that it
considers me a freak; I’m not
strong enough to remain open
with friends who think that also.
Given that you've said you're
angry about me being a lesbian,
continuing to be friends will
require work. I'd like to support
you in this.

Love,
