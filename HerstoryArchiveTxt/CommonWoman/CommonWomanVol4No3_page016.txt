Summer Games By Joan Tennessee

There will be different activities this summer for Burlington area womyn, ranging from rock climbing to softball.

I want to encourage anyone who is having second thoughts about her ability to play sports to talk with me. Last summer was the first time for many womyn to feel comfortable playing softball, so I don’t want it to be the last time. Hopefully, we can start playing volleyball (outside) in Burlington by May. According to womyn center surveys, volleyball, softball, and soccer are the most popular sports to play. If there is anyone who wants to go hiking or rock climbing or anything else, please use Everywoman’s Place for a contact. I have taken the organization for these and other activities on myself, so I’m gonna need a lot of help, but mostly a lot of participation.

So drop by Everywoman’s Place for sign up or to check out other weekend events! Everywoman's Place is on the second floor at 200 Main Street, Burlington.

Women’s Information Exchange, a feminist information technology project, is pleased to announce the NATIONAL WOMEN’S MAILING LIST. For the first time, women throughout the nation will be able to voluntarily sign up to receive mail in a variety of interest areas — from women’s culture, sports, politics, and health, to mailings about women’s spirituality, non-traditional employment, and issues regarding violence against women. The list of interest areas reaches into every field that touches women’s lives.

The National Women's Mailing List is the feminist response to the computer lists of the Moral Majority and the National Conservative Political Action Committee, which so effectively mobilized anti-feminist forces in the last election.

Individual women and women's organizations are invited to participate in this vital information and communications resource. Registration is FREE, donations are encouraged. To obtain registration forms or further information, contact The National Women’s Mailing List, 1195 Valencia St, San Francisco, CA 94110.
