FERTILITY AWARENESS

What is fertility awareness?  
Why is it important to us as  
women to understand our  

fertility cycles? What is the  
connection between fertility  
awareness and natural birth  

control? These are just some of  
the questions that I asked Janet  
Young and Karen Kreda who are  
both involved in teaching classes  
in fertility awareness at the  
Vermont Women’s Health  
Center. At these classes the  
physiological basis for the  
method of fertility awareness is  
discussed with visual aids, as well  
as rules that can turn this  
knowledge into an effective  
means of natural birth control.

Fertility awareness involves  
getting in touch with your  
body's natural cycles and  
patterns. It fosters self-reliance  
and a heightened awareness of  
your body and its rhythms. In  
order to gain fertility awareness  
for its own sake, or as a method  
of natural birth control, a  
woman must be willing to touch  
her body, and explore her  
sexuality. She must become  
familiar with the appearance and  
sensation of her daily cervical  
secretions. Specifically, this  
means observing your day-to-day  
pattern of cervical mucus by  
touching your vaginal opening to  
feel the consistency and to see  
the color of your discharge. It  
may take one to two months  
before a woman is able to  
recognize and assess what stage  
her mucus is at in terms of  
fertility risk, if the method is  
being used for pregnancy  
prevention. One benefit of  
becoming familiar with your  
monthly mucus pattern is that  
you become aware of what is a  
normal mucus pattern and what  
is an abnormal discharge. (An  
abnormal discharge does not  
change day to day and may  
cause itching and a foul odor.)

Normal mucus is produced by  
glands that are just inside the  
cervical os or opening. As a  
woman approaches ovulation,  
the hormone estrogen (produced  
by her ovaries) stimulates the  
mucus glands to start secreting.  
By learning to recognize the  
presence of this mucus and the  
gradual changes in it, a woman  
can identify fertile and infertile  
phases in her cycle.

In order to become familiar  
with her mucus cycle, women  
are asked to chart both the  
sensation and the appearance of  
their mucus. Here is a  
description of a woman’s typical  
mucus pattern. The onset of  
bleeding is considered to be the  
beginning of the cycle. The days  
directly after bleeding ceases, in  
terms of discharge, are often  
“dry.” There will be no  
discharge, but the vagina still  
feels moist, much like inside the  
mouth. It is difficult to say how  
long this period will last, as  
every woman’s cycle is different.

The next stage is the onset of  
mucus. A woman feels a  
sensation of dampness and  
moistness. The discharge will  
appear yellow or white and have  
a thick pasty consistency. In  
fact, it will form stiff peaks  
when held between two fingers.  
The vaginal mucus becomes  
more liquid and creamy and the  
sensation now is still wet. The  
most fertile part of the cycle is  
described by a clear mucus (like  
a raw egg white) which will form  
long strands when stretched  
between two fingers. The last  
day of this is referred to as the  
“peak symptom.” The sensation  
during this stage is “gushy.” This  
is the stage when some women  
are most likely to think that  
they have an abnormal discharge  
and may even want to wear a  
pad or a tampon. This symptom  
will markedly disappear and the  
mucus will become creamy or  
tacky, or non-existent for the  
rest of the cycle. Ovulation  
occurs the day after the peak  

symptom.  
After ovulation, the ovary  
produces a second hormone,  

progesterone. Progesterone is  
known as the heat-producing  
hormone because it causes a rise  
in the body's resting  
temperature. When charting  
daily basal body temperatures, a  
sustained rise in temperature can  
confirm the mucus observations  
which indicated ovulation had  
occurred. At the same time, the  
cervix also changes cyclically.  
During the onset of mucus, the  
cervix begins to raise, soften and  
the os dilates (opens); prior to  
this and after ovulation, the  
cervix lowers, becomes firmer  
and closes. A woman can learn  
to recognize these changes as  
well as temperature and mucus  
changes. As women begin to  
tune in to these hormonally-  
triggered changes, they often  
become more aware of other  
cyclic changes such as mood,  
creativity, dreams and sex drive.  
The combined observations of  
mucus and charting of basal  
body temperature rise, together,  
give this method its name which  
is the sympto-thermal method of  
natural birth control.

In terms of fertility, the egg  
can live at the most 24 hours.  
However, sperm can be kept  
alive in the mucus for up to  
seven days, though it is thought  
that they are viable for less time.  
Therefore, depending on a  
woman's cycle, she must abstain  
from intercourse for  
approximately seven to ten days.  
This does not mean, however,  
that she must also abstain from  
sexual play and orgasm.

There are many and varied  
benefits associated with the use  
of fertility awareness as a  
method of natural birth control.  
First of all, this method allows a  
woman to reclaim control of her  
body. She learns, perhaps for the  

first time, the joys and  
responsibilities that fertility  
brings. By using this method she  
becomes familiar with her  
body’s natural rhythms and she  
becomes more self-reliant in  
terms of what is happening to  
and in her body. Secondly, this  
method is not bound to the  
medical and drug industries. A  
woman does not expose herself  
to various health hazards by use  
of the method, i.e., she does not  
have to use chemicals (the pill,  
spermicidal creams) or devices in  
order to contracept. The method  
is cheap and highly effective  
when used properly. The  
method is simple and easily  
taught and can be used by all  
women. Perhaps one of the most  
important benefits is that this  
method of contraception allows  
a woman to get in touch with  
her natural cycle. She is not  
conquering or controlling her  
body, rather she is respecting  
and living in harmony with it.

Natural birth control calls for  
an intense sense of motivation  
and responsibility on the part of  
both sexual partners.  
Communication between  
partners is a must, if the method  
is to be effective. Both partners  
must seriously examine their  
thoughts and priorities honestly  
regarding having children,  
spacing children, and their  
feelings regarding an unplanned  
pregnancy. Men who previously  
disassociated themselves from  
the burden of contraception,  
now find themselves active  
participants in the success or  
failure of the method.

In order for this method of  
birth control to be effective for  
a single woman, she must be able  
to exercise this knowledge in  
terms of whether or not she has  
or doesn’t have intercourse.  
Studies have shown that women  
must be highly motivated to use  
this method effectively.

Another benefit of this  
method is that it can also be  
used to choose the best and  

most fertile time for a woman to  
conceive. This is a very good  
method for couples that are  
having trouble with infertility  
and women, both lesbian and  
straight, who wish to get  
pregnant through artificial  
insemination. Natural birth  
control through fertility  
awareness associates the  
potential act of intercourse with  
procreation.  
After a woman becomes  
accustomed to her cycle, this  
method of natural birth control  
eventually becomes as simple as  
feeling whether you are wet or  
dry. If you feel wet, then it is  
time to tune in more closely to  
the appearance of the mucus.  
Natural birth control is just  
beginning to take off on a  
national level. Although most  
physicians do not readily accept  
this method of birth control  
(they feel women cannot  
recognize the cycle accurately  
enough), Secretary of Health,  
Education and Welfare, Joseph  
Califano, is pushing to have  
federally funded agencies teach  
natural methods of birth  
control. Various religious  
organizations and churches are  
funding research and donating  
funds to natural birth control  
study. Naturally, pharmaceutical  
companies are not doing any  
research as there is no money to  
be made from the proliferation  
of natural birth control. Both  
Janet and Karen feel strongly  
that the method should be  
taught on a widespread basis. It  
should also be taught by a user  
of the method — a person who is  
committed to the method. A  
person who is personally  
involved with the method is  
naturally better able to provide  
support and understanding to  

new users of the method.  
Ideally, fertility awareness  
would be taught to young  
women in school biology classes.  
(Grade school on up.) These  
young women would then be  
able to understand what is going  

on in their bodies, in that their  
menstrual cycle is a cycle of  
fertility. Perhaps this knowledge  
would enable women to better  
love and appreciate their bodies.

We, as women, are taking  
back control of our bodies from  
men and the medical world. We  
can finally exercise our right and  
responsibility to control our  
bodies without aid of physicians  
or chemicals. We are taking that  
power back by simply becoming  
aware of our natural cycles and  
patterns.
