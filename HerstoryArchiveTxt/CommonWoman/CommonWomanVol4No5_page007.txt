Culture. It is a culture we  
separate from. A culture which  
teaches that all things about  
women are inferior, less impor-  
tant: her intelligence, work, art,  
physical ability. A culture which  
explains that women’s successes  
are exceptions. “She thinks like  
a man.” “She writes just like a  
man.” “She can throw as far as  
any man.”

All feminist movements  
have spread the same “separate”  
information; what you have  

been told “a woman is” is  
inaccurate. The collage of  
coquettishness, dilettantism,  

helplessness, mysteriousness,  
maternainess, and problems with  
math is not accurate.

At this time, in this coun-  
try, there is a feminist move-  
ment and women are telling each  
other, and themselves, what is  
accurate.

We are telling through a  
process which includes our own  
stories, our own history. We  
unwrap secret feelings and pub-  
lic wrongs.

So. There are books about  
and by women of the past,  
either previously published or  
never published. (The culture  
has been purposely silent about  
our past.)

There is women’s research:  
new interpretations of “anthro-  
pology,” or “history;” new  
interpretations of myths. (The  
culture has been solemn, straight  
and patriarchal in its vision.)

There is a network: infor-  
mation from other women about  
our bodies, our position in the  
culture: crucial economic and  
sexual information.

There is an audience, apart  
from the culture, for women’s  
songs and poetry: women’s art.

There is a caretaking, apart  
from the culture.

I call this work separatism.  
Separatism. I know, there is a  
problem with the word. Is it the  
separatism of women from men,  
or the separatism of “Separatist”  
women from other women?  
Does separatism mean a choice  
to live, work with, love only  
other women? Or can it mean  
involvement in politics, sports,  
activities that are completely  
female, to take place in a life  
that includes men, as friends  
and/or lovers?

So. We all agree. We want to  
change things, as previous femi-  
nists did, for all women. We see  
that we have been deprived,  
starved, our thoughts raided and  
replaced. We see women around  
us who believe they are, as a  
gender, inferior, frivolous,  
bodies existing for reproduction  
which will, with luck, please  
men. We concentrate on reject-  
ing humiliating myths and set-  
ting forth a new set of realities  
and myths. We tell out loud the  
patterns of misogyny and vio-  
lence against women; tell out  
loud that we will have rape crisis  

In political struggles, in  
Cuba and Nicaragua, women  
who have joined in revolutionary  
activity struggle and continue to  

SPLINTERING  

struggle for their roles to change.

Revolution does not yet write  

into its process equality for  
women: our societal memories  
have no model for this. It is a  
separate battle, this battle  
against centuries of saturated  
humiliation of women.

It is a separate battle.  
Separatist. And the word itself  
evokes exclusion, polarization,  
determination.

It is a word that appears to  
conjure up an “answer.” Like a  
genie with the truth. It is a  
strong word provoking a moral  
stance, right and wrong.

Said aloud it invites exclu-  
sion. Secret clubs — magic  
happenings for members only.  
(Suffering what we usually refer  
to as an adolescent feeling,  
being “left out,” is widespread  
among adults.)

So. Is a lesbian politically  
incorrect when she likes James  
Bond movies? Do I have a right  
to call myself radical if I sleep  
with a man? Correctness/Incor-  
rectness: it has the power to  
displace, confuse, anger. As if in  
the process of our own lives and  
efforts we do not, cannot,  
concentrate on different angles,  
forget at different speeds. As if  
we were not creating a new  
process, as if it were already  
settled.

(I see myself leafing, con-  

descendingly, through Ms.  
magazine. Establishment co-  
opted...feminism...I laugh to  

myself. But I am a little frighten-  
ed as I see ad men turn “femi-  
nism” into a perfume, a com-  
modity. Yet, the woman who  
sees Ms. for the first time may  
not feel co-opted, she may  
feel the world opening up for  
her.)

We splinter. We work hard.  
Our thoughts are kind. We love  
each other. A splinter. A drop of  
blood here on the tip of a finger.  
The blood, healthy. Push hard  
and the skin around drains. Lick  
the blood, a sliver of wood  
under the skin marked with the  
circular lines of the future. Steri-  
lize a pin. Be gentle. The splinter  
is out. It leaves only a small  
wound.

Women, in women’s work,  
are stretching, airing, strengthen-  
ing our intellect, imaginations.  
We talk loudly, absorbed in  
interest. They call it strident and  
we disagree, “They” are not  
only men. Many women are still  
absorbed in the culture. We  
disagree. We carefully try to  
learn from one another. We are  
paying attention to new things:  
to economics, to racism, to the  
class system, to the power of the  
words of the culture we fight.

We disagree. Disagreeing is  
part of the creative process. It is  
part of the energy of discovery.

And women can hate dis-  
agreement, having learned to be  
healers, nurturers against the  
worst of stakes. And now, we  
have a further reason to bond, in  
our hyperconsciousness of  
oppression.

We are political. Anger and  
frustration turned outward, but  
how much of it is still inward? Is  
all of our disagreeing, separating,  
part of a creative process? Is  

some of it petty, blinding,  
distracting?  
Creating the future and  

living now with the shredding  
strong remnants inside of us of  
what we were supposed to be.  
How many of us are not in  
personal struggle?

Impatience makes us happy  
and strong, sullen and powerful.  
Issues. Separatism is a word. An  
ideology. An issue. A program.

I am outside the separatism  
that defines itself as apart from  
men. But I do not feel outside  
when I sit at a Commonwoman  
editorial meeting. I feel dis-  
agreed with, but not rejected. I  
am sometimes asked “Why?”  
Yes, there is a gap in full and  
all-encompassing understanding.  
But, not only with me. All of us  

disagree, at times. I’m like  
everyone else — I need to feel  
accepted and included. I get  

enough warmth, clear laughter,  
support, to balance the choices I  
make that are different.

Different. Separate. Exclu-  
ded. There have been times  
when I have not felt accepted by  
lesbians. I have heard an apoliti-  
cal lesbian say she is not  
accepted by political lesbians.  
And, I have heard, over and  
over, the story of lesbians being  
slighted, set aside, by straight  
women. I know this happens.  
Among women.

I have noticed, over and  
over, that community activities,  
some of the best researched and  
clearly written books about  
women, women’s art — are the  
work of lesbians.

I am outside, observing. I  
have defended radical lesbian  
separatism as an idea/ideal, one  
of the possibilities of concentra-  
ted feminism. But, I do not  
consider this the “one answer.”  
I do not envision a world with all  

women and men in separate  
camps.  
We disagree. We make  

different choices. We argue. We  
get angry and alienated. New  
ideas are pushed into existence  

by struggle.  
In the 1860s the National  
Women Suffrage Association  

(NWSA) split from the American  
Women’s Suffrage Association  
(AWSA) to become a separatist  
organization, with only women  
members and officials. In 1878  
the National Citizen and Ballot  
Box became NWSA’s official  
paper, stating its goal: “As the  
first process toward becoming  
well is to know you are ill, one  
of the principal aims of the  
National Citizen will be to make  
those women discontented who  
are now content.”

Excerpt from a 17-yr.-old les-  
bian high school student to a  
local Burlington dyke. are  
changed.  
“I’m in such a bind! My  
emotions are going wild! I have  
so many questions, so many  
feelings and thoughts to clear  
my aching head. Where do  
I start? I worked at a camp this  
summer and again I felt like an  
alien. Girls date guys, talk about  
guys, sex with guys. I was so  
lost. I had to pretend I liked  
guys, I feel robbed. I hate  
myself! I love Jean! I know I do!

DEAF

Deaf women, like deaf peo-  
ple in mainstream society, are  
frequently isolated from others  
and are often left out of events  
in the women’s community. This  
alienation results, at least in-  
part, from hearing people’s lack  
of understanding, leading to  
fear, prejudice, and the perpe-  
tuation of stereotypes and  
myths. Knowledge, awareness,  
and sensitivity may help ease  
misunderstandings. The follow-  
ing concepts are offered to raise  
some consciousness around the  
issue of access to the women’s  
community for hearing-impaired  
women.

1. It is ironic that concerts  
are primarily the events which  
are consistently interpreted, con-  
sidering that deaf women do not  
share hearing women’s apprecia-  
tion of music. This appears to be  
exploitation of the beauty of  
American Sign Language, for the  
benefit of hearing women. Deaf  
women’s actual communication  
needs for events such as rap  
groups, meetings, etc., are  
ignored.

2. The restrictions put on  
deaf women around the issue of  
interpreters are not acceptable.  
The struggle to obtain interpre-  
ters for events we wish to attend  
is energy-draining. It is not OK  
to require a minimum number of  
deaf women to attend before  
providing an interpreter. It is not  
OK to expect deaf women to do  
the outreach work. It is not OK  
to request advance notice that  
an interpreter will be needed.  
And it is not OK to pressure  
deaf women to attend an event  
because it will be interpreted. If  
none show up, that is OK. Deaf  
women need the same choices as  
hearing women have, such as to  
decide at the last minute about  
attending an event.

3. Costs of interpreter ser-  
vices should be figured into  
events’ expenses, along with  
rent, childcare, etc. The com-  
munity needs to share the  
responsibility for access to all  
people.

4. The special seating needs  
of hearing-impaired women need  
to be respected. The interpreter  
must be clearly visible, free of  
distraction and obstruction.  
Photographers and others should  
understand this. When able-  
bodied women complain about  
disabled women getting “special  
privileges,” this reeks of screams  
of “reverse discrimination.” This  
demonstrates ignorance of the  
discrimination against disabled  
people in many spheres of daily  
life.

“I've never felt so much for  
someone, not even Nancy,  
whom I love. It’s not that I want  
to be lovers, but I want some-  
thing — what it is I don’t know!  
I love women, I always will. I  
can't live here. I feel as though  
I'm exploding. I don't know  
where I am. Before I felt this  
way I was happier, I felt secure,  
comfortable about me and  
others. Now what? I have  
feelings of hate, anger and hurt a  
lot; more than happiness and  
contentment. I care, I'm energetic,  
I'm tired! I don’t know what to do with my  
life, if I want to belong to my  
family, friends, anymore. I’m  
not trying to sound self-pitiful.  
But I don’t know what to do or  
anything! This letter doesn’t  
make sense, but what does of  
my life anyway? What do I do?  
I'm really scared! I need you.

Please; Ma

5. In a group situation, it is  
frustrating at best, impossible at  
worst, to follow a discussion  
when many women are talking  
at once and interrupting each  
other, whether or not an inter-  
preter is present. Hearing women  
cannot understand the conver-  
sation under these circumstances  
either. Respect each other and  
what you have to say. Help the  
interpreter if she requests assis-  
tance, so that the deaf women  
can keep up with the discussion.

6. Hearing women should  
not rely completely on the  
interpreter to communicate with  
deaf women, but should try to  
communicate yourselves with  
your hearing-impaired sisters.  
Don’t ignore us or leave us to  
communicate only with the  
interpreter. Don't be afraid to  
try to communicate with us,  
especially in 1-to-1 situations  
where we can understand with  
greater ease.

7. If you talk to a hearing-  
impaired woman and one of you  
does not sign, or there is no  
interpreter present, and she is  
able to read your lips, keep  
your mouth unobstructed and  
make sure there is enough light.  
Talk clearly, but in your usual  
manner. Don’t shout. If it is  
necessary to repeat, try re-phras-  
ing your words. Write if needed.  
Fingerspell if you both know  
how. Be creative in finding ways  
to communicate. If the deaf  
woman makes a suggestion, try  
it, as she has more experience in  
this than you do. If an interpre-  
ter is present, speak to the deaf  
woman and not the interpreter.  
Look at her and say what you  
wish; do not say to the interpre-  
ter, “Tell her...”

8. Different women have  
different types and amounts of  
hearing loss. Some wear hearing  
aids, some don’t. Some use our  
voices, some don’t. Don’t make  
assumptions about deafness or  
deaf women. Don’t be afraid or  
embarrassed to ask us questions.

9. Hearing women need to  
take at least some of the respon-  
sibility for educating yourselves  
about deaf women’s lives. Often  
a barrier exists in relationships  
between deaf and hearing  
women because of lack of  
understanding of the meaning  
and effects of deafness, which  
are hidden and invisible.

10. Reach out to women in  
the deaf community, take the  
trouble to communicate with us,  
learn about us, include us in  
your activities and lives. In this  
way, you can benefit from our  
participation and we can learn  
from each other as we all work  
together on our common strug-
