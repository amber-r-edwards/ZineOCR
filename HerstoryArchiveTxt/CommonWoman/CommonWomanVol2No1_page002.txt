The Commonwoman  
Collective feels it’s time to let  
our readers know how we're  
doing. We'd like to give you  
some picture of the process  
we've been using to put this  
paper together, as well as give  
you an idea of some of our  

struggles.  
WHAT WE ARE TRYING TO  
DO:

Our vision of Commonwoman  
is to provide a forum for the free  
exchange of women’s ideas and  
opinions, whether conservative  
or radical, political or apolitical,  

capitalist or socialist,  
heterosexual or lesbian,  
"housewife" or “career  
woman,” mother, daughter,  

sister; in short, Commonwoman  
is a celebration of women’s  
diversity — our skills, arts,  
accomplishments, and feelings.  
HOW WE ARE DOING IT:  
Working Structure  

We have three working  
committees (layout, editorial  
and business/distribution) as  
well as a decision-making core  
group. The core group meets to  
determine policy and evaluate  
the newspaper. We make  
decisions by consensus, which  
means that all members must  
consent to a decision — although  
we may not necessarily all agree.  
Non-hierarchical, collective  
decision-making is slow and  
frustrating. The Commonwoman  
collective staff and committee  
members are at present working  
on an unpaid-for basis (not  
volunteer, i.e. we view this as  
work that should and at some  
point will be paid for). Our time  
and energy commitments vary as  
we can afford to take time from  
our jobs, our families, our selves.  
The committees are at present  
open to any women who are  
interested in working on the  
paper. Those who work through  
two issues are then invited to  
become members of the core  
group.  

Editorial Process  

Once a month the editorial  
committee meets for several  
hours to go over and edit  
whatever copy we've received.  
Since we don’t have officially

Letter  
From the Collective  

designated reporters to go out  
and find the news, we have to  
rely on what comes through the  
mail unsolicited, what member  
of the collective or committee  
would like to write what article  
this month, or who in the group  
knows someone else who might  
be interested in writing an article  
on this and that. At this point we  
usually confront one of our  
“standing arguments.” To some  
of us, the writing may not be  
exciting or grammatical or  
“professionally journalistic.”  
However, we have not yet  
established criteria for judging  
quality or content of copy,  
although we do talk in terms of  
a balanced paper. Sometimes we  
send copy back to the author for  
revision, sometimes we decide to  
hold an article for another issue  

“because we have too much copy,  

and sometimes we call the  
author and ask permission to  

edit it ourselves. (One time we  
failed to ask permission, and  
that was a mistake.) Due to  
deadline pressures we often  

make last minute decisions (at  
11:30 p.m. the night before  
copy is due at the typesetter’s,  

for example) that we are not  
always comfortable with. We are  
aware of these problems and  
want to improve our process for  
soliciting and selecting articles.  

Now and then, because of the  
diversity among the women in  
the editorial committee, we have  
heated arguments about articles  
that seem too “radical” to some  
members of the committee, or  
too “conservative,” or not from  
a “feminist perspective.” That  
term, “feminist perspective,”  
which is part of the masthead,  
has been a big problem for the  
collective. Although all of us  
identify ourselves as feminists,  
our perceptions of what that  
means for this and future  
societies vary widely. Further,  
many of us feared that printing  
the word “feminist” would turn  
people away who might  
otherwise enjoy, write for, or  
support the paper. We thought  
that the label would be too  
limiting. Others of us felt that  
using the label “feminist” is a  

Shoplifting  

To Commonwoman:  

How can the act of shoplifting  
ever bring an end to the control  
Corporate America has over the  
people? Shoplifting is a crime  
that does not end after the act  
of stealing is completed. It is  
repercussive in that all prices  
must increase to compensate for  
the articles that prove to be  
missing in a store's periodic  
inventory.  

For those of us who choose to  
purchase what we may want or  
need, the responsibility is placed  
upon us to pay for the stolen  
articles through the increased  
prices. The act of stealing does  
not strike back at Corporate  
America; it lashes out at our  
own innocent sisters and  
brothers. It appears that you  
believe shoplifting to be a  
righteous act, justifiable in that  
it is a political statement,  
speaking its defiance of the  
Corporate America. If stealing is  
such a positive force in opposing  
this system, why then does it  
adversely affect the innocent?  

I do not see shoplifting as a  
political statement, or a “viable  
way” of striking back. I see you  
using your politics as your own  
private license to steal.

Dear Commonwoman:  
I loved the article on  
shoplifting. It was concise and  
true for me. She should have had  
a byline. I support you all for  
printing it.  
Glo  

To the Editors:  
When Standard Oil and Exxon  

stop ripping off the  
environment; when the nuclear  
power mongers stop playing  

“Russian roulette” with all our  
lives; when the Rockefellers and  
their friends stop stealing from  

the tax system and stealing  
everybody's labor; when men  
confront each other and put an  
end to rape and all violence  
against women; when we all own  
it all and shoplifting means that  
I am stealing from myself or  
from those who have no more  
than I do — then I'll stop.  
Thanks for the good article on  
shoplifting.

Dear Commonwoman:  

I have read your paper with  
interest since its inception. I feel  
that your last issue deserves  
some criticism.  

I enjoyed your coverage of  
the NOW work and I hope that  
you bring the women of the  
Burlington community more up  
to date on the national news  

that is affecting women  
throughout the country. In  
order to build a woman's  

movement that is broader and  
speaks to the concerns of all  
women, it is necessary to have  
this information.  

I did not like the article on  
shoplifting in this last issue. I do  
not feel that shoplifting is a  
revolutionary act at all.  
Shoplifting is taking something  
that is not yours, period. It is  
not honest. The person who  
wrote the article obviously  
thinks that her small act of  
terrorism will make a difference.  
If one is really talking about  
revolution, individual acts are  
not the order of the day — real  
revolution demands  
organization, determination and  
honesty. I also do not believe  
that shoplifting keeps you sane  
or will soon be on the decline.  
Shoplifting is a way that  
someone avoids the real tasks at  
hand to dabble in some  
adventure while taking great  
risks. Also, since the economy is  
in another crisis of  
overproduction and inflation is  
rampant and unemployment  
rising, shoplifting will continue  
to increase, because people will  
steal to survive. This does not  
mean that it is a “revolutionary”  
act nor should it be encouraged.  

Also, the differences that are  
made between businesses are  
vague. The Bookstacks is really  

upon close examination no  
different than any business  
partnership that isn’t doing so  
well, and The Frayed Page is not  
unlike numerous hippie-type  
enterprises across the country  
that combine politics with a soft  
business front.  
I also think that if your paper  

is really serious about surviving  
it must talk to a broader  
audience. Sometimes it reads  
like an “in” newsletter for a very  
small circle of people. I wish you  
success.

Thanks  

To the Commonwoman  
Collective:  
I am on a bus traveling  

through Florida on my way back  
to Vermont. With me are copies  
of the four issues of  
Commonwoman thus far  
printed; I leave them in womyn’s  
spaces and communities along  
my way. The womyn who have  
read them are excited; they ask  
me questions about the paper,  
about Burlington, about the  
womyn there.  

It feels wonderful to me to  
have these papers with me —  
they represent and share so  
much process, feelings and  
perspectives. On the bus I read  
through them all, remembering  
and re-experiencing the thirst  
and excitement I felt with each  
new issue.  

I want to tell you all that you  
are doing valuable, precious  
work. I have watched some of  
your meetings, seen some of the  
exhaustion of late night deadline  
decisions, layout, of  
disagreement and frustration.  
Thank you all for creating this  
paper, for working through so  
many hard places and  
continuing. Your energy and this  
newspaper is a special  
connection in and for our  
growing womyn’s community —  
it is part of our herstory and our  
opening.  

I feel a strong and growing  
respect for your collective  
process, and I share the  
excitement of the womyn in  
Florida about these issues of  
Commonwoman. Thank you. In  
celebration and support.

Shoplifting  

The article “On Shoplifting,”  
which appeared in our December  
issue, does not reflect the  
opinion of every member of the  
Commonwoman collective. The  
author of the article (not a  
member of the collective) wishes  
to remain anonymous.  

Correction  

We regret that the poems  
“Barnacle” and “There Are No  
Services on This Route — To the  
Memory of Karen Silkwood,”  
both of which appeared in our  
December issue, were mistakenly  
bylined “June Aleshire.” The  
poet is Joan Aleshire.
