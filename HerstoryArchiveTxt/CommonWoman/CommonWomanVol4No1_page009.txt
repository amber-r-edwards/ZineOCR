Class

(Continued from Page 5)

FEBRUARY 1981

In terms “working-class,” “ruling-
class,” bourgeoisie, and com-
munism. That's where I discovered
I was “working-class,” and I
seemed to get some kind of
token support for it, even some
kind of weird respect. Not
actually for who I was, but for
the fact that I was working-class.
I still seemed to be overlooked a
lot, not taken seriously, even
ignored. I was for certain not
very outspoken or articulate
compared to my “political com-
rades.” I was quiet and shy and
felt inferior. And for all the lip
service support for working-class
people, no one ever seemed to
notice that they (the middle-
class politicos) were doing all the
talking, and all the thinking and
all the work for me, for my
struggle, for the “working-class
people.” No one ever paid much
attention to me, a small work-
ing-class woman, and saw how
much I was struggling to acquire
the skills other people had and
took for granted (not seen as
privileges) that seemed so necessary
in doing political work.
I did learn some wonderful
slogans (that later on I was able
to identify as rhetoric), such as
“working-class people are the
salt of the earth” and “Dictatorship
of the Proletariat — that’s me!” and none of this meant

these admirable people. I wanted
to talk like them, think like
them, even play like them (i.e.,
go skiing, hiking, bicycle tour-
ing, and play tennis). Not that
all middle-class radicals play
tennis, etc., but these sports
were definitely more popular
than bowling or playing gin
rummy on a Saturday night. I
was fortunate, though. I lived
with a middle-class political
man, and he tried to help me

learn all the things that would
make me more the way he was,
so I could be happy. For exam-
ple, he had a beautiful fancy
bicycle and went on wonder-
ful bike trips all the time, and
since we were a couple and were
supposed to do things together, I
went out and bought myself a
fancy, expensive ten-speed bicy-
cle, with his encouragement. Of
course I had a hard time riding
it, never having had a bicycle
growing up. And of course I felt
very bad about myself, again, for
something I couldn’t do. He also
tried to change me to be calm,
composed and speak in a ration-
al manner when I was painfully
angry and was instead used to
screaming and yelling and cry-
ing. I really began to believe that
I was a “crazy woman” whenever I expressed myself so
candidly.

I’m remembering now all
the painful struggles I’ve gone
through to become someone I’m
not, and all the ways I’ve tried
to hide who I really am, and all
the ways I've been oppressed by
my supportive, political “class-
ist” comrades.

Now I'm a lesbian. Again
trying to fit in. I’m getting
closer, I can feel it, but this time

I feel stronger and more in touch
with the anger and distrust I
have towards middle-class peo-
ple/women/lesbians. Some
women in Burlington are feeling
very angry and distrustful these
days. Working-class women not
trusting middle-class women;
Black and Third World women
not trusting white women, and
all for good reason; many
women not trusting men —
makes good sense! It's a man’s
world/culture/society -
PATRIARCHY. Women’s cul-
ture/herstory/self has been
denied. Much of women’s exis-
tence has been trying to “fit in”
to their molds, and very few
women fit, painfully realizing
their oppression.

It’s also a white, middle-
class culture/society. My own
existence as a white working-
class woman has been trying to
fit in, buy in, become like
middle-class people. I’ve been
denying who I am and rejecting
my culture, feeling unaccept-
able, having less all the time
while seeing others having more.
I've struggled long and hard to
become someone I’m not, some-
one I wasn’t brought up to be,
denied much of my childhood,
my growing up experiences,
trying to pretend they didn’t
exist. I've been buying into a
culture that oppresses me...
doesn’t accept me, I've bought
in and have oppressed myself by
not accepting myself. That reali-
zation hurts me deeply. I've
gone through a period of reject-
ing me, my past, my family
(who at one time I had much
contempt for),
friends, a

I fear I may have lost forever.
My own ethnic back-
ground has been denied me

because of my parents and
grandparents rejecting who they
were, to fit into and to become

more acceptable in their “new
world” white middle-class
America.

Middle-class lifestyle,
values, everything is very differ-
ent than working-class. White
culture is very different than
black and Third World cultures.
Growing up white is so different
than growing up any other color
in this country. Growing up with
very little money is so different
than growing up with lots, or
even with just enough. This is so
obvious. Yet why do so many
people assume we are the same?
Why does everyone assume we
should be thinking, feeling,
doing the same things? Making
the same political choices? Why
do people forget that they are
who they are and can do what
they can do because of certain
privileges easily granted them
because of looks, class and racial
background?

I have lived with self-hate
for a long time. I also have and
have had many privileges. But I
refuse to compare myself to
(give power) or measure up ever
again to someone else’s stan-
dards, to a person with more
status than myself because of
privileges they’ve had that I
haven’t. At the same time, I
need to be very careful of not
oppressing someone with my
privileges. I refuse to be patient
with politically aware women
who try to deny their privilege
(i.e., defensiveness, and down-
ward mobility as the “politically
correct” choice), I respect
women who are giving up the
privileges they can, and staying
very aware all the time of the
privileges they have that can’t so
easily be given up, but which
make living a little bit — and
sometimes a lot easier for them.
Many women within the
lesbian women’s community are
working very hard to create
and/or bring back women's
culture — rejecting patriarchal
values. Well, along with the sexist
patriarchal attitudes are racist,
looksist and classist attitudes
that continue to oppress many
women. We must begin to realize
our privileges as privileges and
pay very close attention to how

we are oppressing other women
and STOP! NOW!

Racism

(Continued from Page 6)

to us to be degraded, then what
makes it so hard for us to trans-
fer the same feelings to other
people who are degraded?

If gay men and lesbians are
to help form a new and humane
society, we must rid ourselves of
sexism, racism, and looksism.
How can we expect others to
follow our example when we do
the same old stuff that the rest
of society does? Let's show the
world that we can really learn
to love and be free.

Fat Oppression

(Continued from Page 5)

celebrates and affirms differ-
ences among us, instead of
trying to destroy people who are
different.

We want to expose the lies
that are the basis of our oppres-
sion as fat women — and encour-
age fat women to listen to our
own experiences and the experi-
ences of other fat women as the
truth about being fat.

We will expose the lies put
out by the medical profession —
and expose the “cures” develop-
ed for fat people — which serve
to keep us physically weak,
starved, preoccupied by diets,
and which kill us simply because
we are fat. We demand that the
medical profession stops pawn-
ing off “cures” — because being
fat is no sickness, and needs no
cure!!

By forming consciousness
raising and political action
groups we want to end the

isolation and self-hatred that fat
women have felt.

We are confronting ideas
and attitudes which oppress us
as fat women, or ideas which
deny our own perceptions of our
lives. We want to confront those
ideas as they come up in public
(like TV or social gatherings)

HEY! DID YOU HEAR THAT
BOB'S FOREIGN AUTO MOVED
TO 377 PINE ST. Benno

CITIZENS’ OFF. CO. ?
THEY SURE HAVE QUALITY RELIABLE
SERVICE FOR FOREIGN CAR REPAIR,

FROM TUNE-UPS TO MOTOR ENGINE
REBUILDING, AND ALL THEIR
WORK IS GUARANTEED! .

and also when they come up

with our friends, lovers or
families.
We are fighting against

social and legal oppression: like
the denial of jobs, or the lack of
inexpensive clothes, or the limits
to mobility created by narrow
chairs, benches and aisles.

We want thin women to see
how they too are victimized by
the fear of getting fat, or the
fear of getting fatter. This fear
keeps all of us preoccupied with
our bodies; and keeps us from
uniting together to fight the real
oppression: a sexist society
which dictates how we ought to
look, or how we ought to live.

We are creating a positive
presence and a positive image as
fat women in sports, at the
workplace, in theatre and the
arts, in the media — everywhere
we go.

We are learning to love and
respect ourselves, and we want
all women to love and respect
fat women, so that each woman
can truly accept her body as
beautiful.
