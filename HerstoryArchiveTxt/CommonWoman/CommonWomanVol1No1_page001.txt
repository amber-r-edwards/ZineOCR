I swear it to you  
I swear it on my common woman’s head  
The common woman is as common as a common loaf of bread —  

and will rise!  

VERMONT  
WOMEN.  

MARCH  

The handful of women, one  
with an 18-month-old baby, who  
climbed aboard the bus in  
Montpelier on Saturday, July 8,  
began the journey of the  
Vermont delegation to  
Washington, D.C. for the  
National ERA March. The Equal  
Rights Amendment, which states  
that “Equality of rights under  
the law shall not be denied or  
abridged by the United States or  
by any State on account of sex,”  
was sent to the states for  
ratification in March, 1972. It is  
presently stalled 3 states short of  
the required 38. Most supporters  
agree that without an extension  
of the deadline of March 22,  
1979, there is no hope of  
passage of the amendment, since  
some unratified state legislatures  
will not even meet again to vote  
until after the deadline. The  
National ERA March was  
coordinated by the National  
Organization for Women (NOW),  
and was scheduled for July 9 to  
commemorate the first  
anniversary of the death of Dr.  
Alice Paul, suffragist and author  
of the Equal Rights  

Mueller  

Amendment, which was first  
proposed in Congress in 1923.  

Among the women on the  
bus, the sense of participating in  
a history-making event was very  
strong, and the early hours of  
the ride were marked by intense  
political discussions and singing  
as the 46 women from all over  
Vermont became acquainted. As  
the hours wore on, the excited  
talk quieted as most tried to rest  
and get what little sleep they  
could. At 8:30 a.m., when the  
bus arrived 13 hours later in  
Washington, it was already 80  
degrees and humid. By 11 a.m.  
the official gathering time, the  
Mall was a sea of white-clad  
humanity, broken by hundreds  
of purple, gold and white  
delegation banners and posters  
held aloft by excited standard  
bearers. The white clothing and  
banner colors were a tribute to  
the ERA’s suffragist heritage,  
echoing the colors worn and  
carried by those who marched in  
Washington in support of the  
vote for women in the early  
1900s.  

As early as 11 a.m., march

Organizers were calling the  
crowd of 30,000 the “largest  
parade for feminism in history;”  
by the height of the rally, the  
commander of the U.S. Park  
Police estimated that 90,000 to  
100,000 demonstrators had  
taken part in the march.  
Sweltering and burning in the 90  
degree plus heat, the marchers  
formed into delegations and  
waited, sharing food and water,  
for the march to begin. At  
12:30, right on time, the front  
of the demonstration moved out  
of the Mall. Marching  
twenty-four abreast behind the  

“National ERA March for  
Ratification and Extension”  
banner, the D.C. Columbian  

Band and another banner giving  
the text of the Equal Rights  
Amendment, wave after wave of  
demonstrators flowed down  
14th Street to Constitution  
Avenue to the west steps of the  
Capitol.  

Among the women and men  
who marched in the forefront as  
“honored guests” were Eleanor

You:  

Womyn At Seabrook  

By Lynn Vera  

In May and June a group of  
local womyn met and began  
working together on the issue of  
Nuclear Power and, specifically,  
they planned occupation of the  
Seabrook nuclear power plant  
on the coast of New Hampshire.  
For many of us it was a first  
time focus on nuclear power: for  
some it was also a  

first-in-a-long-time attempt to  
work on a common project with  
men. The first task proved  
compelling, the latter difficult  
and, for some, impossible. The  
result of our participation in the  
4-day demonstration at  
Seabrook was our sharing in the
