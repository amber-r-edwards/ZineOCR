Dust, or the Escape of the Cleaning Lady

Hey, Dust,  
you get outta here.

I got to chase you

Round and round,

Round and up and down,  
trap you in my cleaning cloth.

Hey, you sister-spider-weaver  
Come on down outta that corner.  
I hate to wreck your feminist home  
But my rich boss lady says  
So.  
So come down.  
I'll give you a ride on  
My broom  
And we'll both escape.

—Bear

Georgia O'Keeffe, as photographed by Stieglitz  
1

He shows her work in his gallery;  

she comes to see how it's hung.

Her face is so soft she might be anyone  
posing once for Stieglitz, smiling to please,  
a nice young teacher from Texas,  

painting on the side.

1

She's spent the night:  
in the morning her hair is down,  

her face drugged with love,  

‘The sun’s warm mouth touches  

her strong throat, the beginning of breasts  
where the kimono falls open.

1

Obsessed with her hands,  
he poses them over and over  

as starfish.

‘They cover curtains and canvasses.  
Wearing a thimble, threading a needle,  
they curve into swans,  

Vv

Her thighs have the strength of workhorses;  
with such breasts she could rule the world.  
He crops these photographs at chin and knees,  
sees her as a statue of Artemis or Athena.

As I took closer, her muscles  

seem to flex.

v

He shows thinning hair,  
face whittled to sharp angles,  
deep lines between the eyes.  
She's been studying skyscrapers’ edges,  
searching for a hill not on any map.  
In the last picture, framed in the Ford's window,  
alone, she'll travel to find it.

Pinball Wizard

Like the silver ball  
In the pinball machine  
I remain calm  
Within my own machinery,  
Until someone comes along  
And pulls the lever  
Lights start flashing  
Bells ringing,  
Score,  
Score,  
Score,  
‘Then it happens,  
‘The inevitable,  
Uncontrollable  
TILT,  
Game Over,  
Lynn

EASTER 1978

‘The grandchildren,  

riding up from Virginia  

through mists of April night,  

hold magnolia blossoms in their hands.  

As they come north into dawn  

they will see how the heavy petals  
open and bruise easily  

and how, outside their windows, leaves  
shrink back into bud  

and trees stiffen.

I am waiting in a land  
where snow holds the earth's cold  
heart, my arms aching  
to gather them.  
Gladys LaFlamme

CENTERING

MANICURE

Snipped every cuticle to the back  
edge of nail corner, cut  
deep to the cracked and trying,  
gouged and tender irregularity, deep  
like my sister has always done  
and her sister before her, too,  
‘We make this ritual, the treating  
of our hands, roughly. A ritual  
meant for the healing to start  
after a long session of mistrims, nips  
and pain. Our hands are very strong  
throughout the emory smoothing and blending of lotion  
but they will not be beautiful until they’re perfect  
will not be perfect  
till they're right.  
Marcia Goldberg

A Spring Ritual

in the spring woods  
bare and warm  
from new heat  
I make a fire  

sit before her  
throwing in  

last winter's leaves  
to urge her  

to soak my face  

in flames  

she coats my hair  

my clothes, my skin  
with her scent  

when she burns  

hard and long  

in the spring wind  

my heart melts  

but I keep her burning lightly  
keep her fires dancing  
on and off  

a light touch  

‘sometimes she explodes softly  
with a crack  

sometimes she rolls  

closer to herself  

to intensify the heat  

I'd nurse her all afternoon  
feed her hemlock twigs  

like feeding my soul  
every woman  
ought to play  
with fire

SHRIMP

I was more dubious than anyone  
mail ordering sea monkeys, Artemia  

salina, the shrimp  

to be birthed miraculously from packet No. 2  
three days after the salt dissolved, tinier  

than swimming gnats and just as clownish  
I would have thrown them out for dead,  

a bad deal, on the second day  

but you, believing  

would not let me, said I didn’t dare  

take one life until the six weeks passed  

the Emergency Instructions directed us to wait. <  

Now I see how they have grown, nearly to a quarter inch,  
swim on their spines and spin their tiny legs.  

For amusement, I note in the guide from Flushing,  

New York, how they breathe from their feet,  

mate in forcible play, kill,  

in rambunctious masses  

if the diet is turned to their liking,  

I would have dumped this dwarfish world,  
presumptuous in all its demands, cataloging  
silly performances creatures can be made to do  
under lights, would have blacked the whole experiment,  
handily. And now the aquarium’s swirling  
with hundreds of quests, you have lost interest,  
little jester. Was it for this —  
to prove with a cartoon offer  
how brilliant the littlest are?  
Marcia Goldberg

RCA

‘They gave me  
A phonograph  
At age three,  
She called it a phonograph,  
He called it a Victrola  
So my silence  
Became less obvious  
And my play  
Had rhythm,  
And if I could lean  
To harmonize  
I would never  
Seem “off beat.”
