Commonwoman, Inc. is a not-for-profit corporation founded
for the purpose of publishing Commonwoman, a Vermont
woman's publication of news, culture and dialogue from a femin-
ist perspective. Commonwoman, Inc. is made up of a small group
of women who work together collectively to put out this paper.
At present, no one on the collective is paid for her work.

We will consider for publication articles, short stories,
graphics and photographs submitted by women. All articles
should be typed and double spaced. COMMONWOMAN will not
be responsible for returning any written materials, poems,
graphics, or photographs unless special arrangements are made
ahead of time or a stamped, self-addressed envelope is provided
by the contributor.

Signed articles reflect the viewpoint of the author and not
necessarily that of the collective.

An Open Letter to the Burlington
Wimmin’s Community from
Flash and Pandora

Dear Sisters,

We love you!!!
As we drive down the
highway toward our next

destination we are filled with
warmth and good vibes from our
visit with you wimmin of
Burlington. We had heard glow-
ing reports from Lynn and Viki
and Marcia and Debbie about
their great community and ya
know, you wimmin are even
more far out than we could have
imagined.

We both thank you all
sincerely for opening yourselves,
space and energies to us. It’s
very important to us to feel at
home so far away from our own
home and to get such a wonder-
ful response to our music. I wish
you'd all move to Florida!
Seriously though, you have a
community spirit that you
should truly feel proud of and
we were glad we could come and
share our energies with you. I
hope we can return next year.
At any rate, perhaps we'll see
some of you in Michigan this
August or in Florida.

Blessed Be

In Sisterhood and Song,
Flash and Pandora

One of the hardest ques-
tions the Commonwoman Col-
lective has had to deal with is
whether to edit articles, and, if
so, how much. In the past, our
policy has been not to edit,
either for length or for clarity,
without the permission of the
author. As a result, we found
ourselves rushing around at the
last minute trying to find
authors, sometimes without suc-
cess. We have sometimes printed
very lengthy articles and left out
others equally good or impor-
tant because we couldn't contact
authors.

Because we are receiving a
lot of copy for each issue, we
have decided that we will edit
for length. We will have less
editing to do if your feature
article is no longer than three
double-spaced, typewritten
pages.

We will also edit for clarity,
if editing will make it possible
for us to print an article. It has
been and will continue to be a
priority for us to contact the
author(s) if possible. You can
help by getting articles in early
or at least on time, with your
name, address, and/or phone
number on the article.

Thanks for helping us bring
women’s news and views to
Vermont.

Yea Team

Dear CommonWomen,

Had to send my congratu-
lations on the last issue of the
newspaper. I am really glad the
collective decided to change
printers; the paper looks and
reads much smoother.

In regards to the editorial
by Dian Mueller, I am glad she
has decided to get off the fence
post at last.

One suggestion — some of
the articles were a little long; try
setting a maximum limit on
length.

Keep up the good work; will
be looking for the next issue.

Sincerely,
Pat D. Metevier
