REMEMBERED

Rape and “Justice”

By Jo Schneiderman

If George Paige’s accuser
was not raped, then I have not
been raped. After my experience
I remember feeling violated,
humiliated, degraded and angry.
But this woman was stronger
than I. She fought back, whereas
I gritted my teeth and “went
through with it.” For her
courage she has been rewarded
with defamation of character
both in the courtroom and
through the Burlington rumor
mill.

The rape trial of George
Paige, a 33-year-old promotion
man from Waitsfield who also
does PR for the Burlington
Square Mall, ended in acquittal
August 17. It illustrated failures
in male/female socialization and
the inadequacy of the current
legal process for dealing with
rape.

George Paige’s behavior was
neither unusual nor socially
disapproved. The woman, on the
other hand, broke a number of
“rules.”

Most women are familiar
with the social myth that if we
don’t actually say “no” we are
interpreted to mean “yes.” We
also mean “yes” even if we say
“no.” If a woman goes to a
man’s apartment, that implies
consent, regardless of how she
got there. If we don’t imme-
diately leave the apartment, even
if it is very cold out and we
don’t know where we are, then
that “proves” consent. If we
accept any invitation from a
man who has expressed an
interest in dating, that means we
want to sleep with him.

No man has ever experi-
enced sitting up in a “compro-
mising” situation while hoping it
won't get sexual — hoping he
will read your body language,
respect your boundaries. No
man has experienced the in-
grained social fear of creating a
scene, of behaving actively ra-
ther than passively, of being
labeled a “cock teaser.”

Because of their superior
strength, no men have experi-
enced the fear of assault result-
ing from sexual refusal. We
should not have to have these
experiences either.

During the experience I
referred to earlier, the man, in
his rage, pulled down the canopy
over my bed and threw things
around. Fearing that he would
do the same thing to me, I gave
in.

In spite of our defense of
our right to refuse sexual advan-
ces most women (and men) still
believe that only “good girls”
can be raped. If a woman has
been drinking, accepted a ride
from a man, invited him to her
apartment, or accepted a date —
then she is a “bad girl.” She's
gotten herself into the situation
and she gets what she deserves.
Merely talking to a man is
construed as leading him on.
Accepting a drink is tantamount
to leaping into bed.

Men on the other hand are
socially trained to ignore wom-
en's body language or stated
refusal. They are allowed to
“misinterpret” cues and perceive
them as come-ons. Many men
assume that if they are sexually
aroused or interested, the wom-
an must feel similarly. So if she
protests she is being either coy
or malicious.

Approximately 150 people
attended the August 6th Hiro-
shima Day Rally in Burlington’s
City Hall Park, commemorating
the thirty-fourth anniversary of
the dropping of the atomic
bomb. It was not hard to tell
those who had merely come to
enjoy their lunch in the sun
from the no-nukers who reli-
giously go to such events. At the
same time, people who a year
ago might have walked past the
rally appeared to be listening
with interest. It’s wonderful
what a crisis situation (specifi-
cally, Three Mile Island) will do
— and how we still have some
survival instinct in us.

Witch 1, a band of wimin,
opened the event with four or
five songs, including an alterna-
tive energy tune demanding that
our atomic poisons be taken
away. With Carter’s renewed
drive to greatly expand Ameri-
can nuclear power, we know
that if we are to live nuke-free in
the future, we must do it our-
selves. Asking the business-
government sector to stop the
nukes please is like asking the
ravenous wolf that has you in its
teeth not to bite. It is at such
rallies that I ask myself, “Can
people allow themselves to see
the huge, irrational threat to life
which nuclear power and espec-
ially nuclear arms pose?” Will we
be willing and able to fight for
our lives? To actually oppose the
corporate state in its lethal
pursuit of increasingly central-
ized power and ever greater
profits?

Robin Lloyd spoke of the
personal aspect of living under
nukes. She described deciding
what to do to make her home a
fraction more bomb-proof. She
said she pondered boarding up
her lakeside picture window,
because of the military’s impos-
sible instruction that “when
you see the blast go off, not to
look,” and whether she should
start stocking her cellar with
groceries. After working herself
into a paranoid frenzy (albeit
completely justified), she said,
“I started to get angry at a
government which was making
me think so much about my
own death.” She has since
become involved with the Bur-
lington Peace Coalition, a group
working for disarmament, and a
co-sponsor of the rally.

David Conrad of the B.P.C.
detailed the emotional experi-
ence of visiting Hiroshima with
his family. The Peace Square in
the center of the city is testi-
mony of man’s error and brutal-
ity, as well as an appeal to the
governments of the world that
we go beyond our capacity for
overkill and develop the far
more difficult ability to live in
peace. He recommended Dr.
Helen Caldicott’s Nuclear Mad-
ness and read several accounts
by young survivors of Hiroshima
and Nagasaki of what it means
to watch your relatives die
slowly from radiation poisoning.

Several other speakers
followed, of whom Terry Bori-
cious was one of the more direct
and comprehensible. He urged us
to refuse to live under nuclear
terrorists: the capitalist men
who seek ever-expanded markets
for their nuclear arsenals and
equipment, the former of which
already gives us the ability to
destroy key Soviet cities 65
times over. Boricious named also
the inseparable counterpart to
the multinational nuclear advo-
cates: the men in government
who seemingly do not realize or
wish to perceive that we come
daily closer to nuclear destruc-
tion, which is by definition
uncontainable.

Doreen Kraft followed with
a few words about the Japanese
legend of the crane. According
to an ancient theory, the crane is
