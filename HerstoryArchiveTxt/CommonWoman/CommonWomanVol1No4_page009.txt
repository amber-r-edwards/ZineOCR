apartment in the last weeks of  
her life. She and two friends  
were contaminated. The  
contamination was traced to  
some sliced bologna and cheese  
in her refrigerator. By chemical  
analysis, the plutonium in the  
refrigerator was linked to a  
particular batch under  
Kerr-McGee’s control.  

One week after the  
contamination incident, Karen  
Silkwood died en route to a  
meeting with a union health  
official and a New York Times  
reporter. Her yellow Honda  
Civic had driven off the road and  
into a concrete culvert. The  
sheaf of documents Karen was  
to have turned over to the union  
and the reporter were missing  
from the car the next day after  
Kerr-McGee officials had visited  
the car twice. The cover-up of  
her death starts here. The  
Highway Patrol ruled that Karen  
had fallen asleep at the wheel.  
OCAW hired an expert who  
found evidence that her car was  
forced off the road by another

Car. Two Congressional  
investigations have been  
cancelled after visits by  

corporation officials. The FBI  
has prevented any further  
investigation by its agents into  
the connection between the  
missing plutonium and the death  
of Karen Silkwood.  

A suit has been filed on behalf  
of Karen's estate, her parents  
and her children against  
Kerr-McGee. The suit charges  
Kerr-McGee Nuclear  
Corporation, Kerr-McGee board  
officials, and FBI agents with  
violating Karen's civil rights as a  
worker, a union activist, and an  
employee who filed grievances  
with the government. Further, it  
charges Kerr-McGee Corporation  
with legal responsibility for the  
plutonium contamination of her  

There Are No Services on this Route  
—To the Memory of Karen Silkwood  

Oklahoma: lonely road across the plains  

The car comes out of nowhere  

Doing 80, doing 90 inches from her bumper  
Won't pass pushes her to higher speeds.  

The concrete abutment waits for the crash;  
Her hands grip the wheel so hard  
it snaps on impact.  

Gloved hands brush her body;  
Steal the folder from the seat.  

It’s an ill-travelled highway,  

Hours before someone sees the wreck.  

The reporter waiting for her story  

begins to call her friends.  

In her empty apartment  

her clothes hang in their dusting of plutonium;  
her food in the refrigerator glows.  

All modern nightmares converge at this spot:  
One woman in danger struggles to speak;  

Her voice rises over the lonely highway  

out of crushed metal and contaminated clothes.  

The plains grasses wave; the signs tell us:  
“There are no services on this route.”

home. The case is on its third  
judge and is expected to come to  
trial in January.  

Local groups held memorial  
events during the week of  
November 11-19. There was an  
information table on Church St.,  
sponsored by The Frayed Page  
Bookstore and local affinity  
groups from Clamshell.  
Montpelier supporters held a  
memorial march, and concerned  
people in New Hampshire  

picketed a Kerr-McGee  
manufacturing plant in East  
Walpole, NH.  

Karen Silkwood died for  
being a strong woman working  
to make her workplace safer and  
to expose corporate wrongdoing  
and faulty production. The  
results of a fault in a fuel rod in  
a nuclear power plant could  
endanger us all. The legal fund  
for the suit against Kerr-McGee  
and the FBI needs money. Send

Safe  
Energy  

An anti-nuke, pro-alternative  
energy group has formed in  
Burlington to fill the gap left by  
the dissolution of the Red  
Clover Alliance Against Nuclear  
Power. The Burlington Safe  
Energy Coalition will be on a  
monthly schedule, — meeting  
Tuesday nights at Saint Paul's  
Church at seven p.m. One  
meeting each month is open to  
the public, featuring a film,  
speaker, or debate. The other  
three meetings each month are  
for business and the steering  
committee. The steering  
committee is elected and rotates  
every two or three months.  
Anyone interested in joining this  
organization should contact Jim  
Ellis at 425-2136.
