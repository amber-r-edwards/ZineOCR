Mission Possible

To Commonwoman:

The ferryboat ride sponsored  
by Mission Possible turned out  
to be a lovely evening; seeing so  
many women having a rowdy  
good time together left me with  
a sense of the solidity of the  
Burlington Women’s movement.

Since then, however, I have  
been hearing rumors about the  
future plans of Mission Possible:  
about their plans to acquire a  
building to house the women’s  
movement; to create a library -  
discotheque - publishing house -  
massage parlor on 4 floors... but  
as of yet there have been no  
public meetings to announce or  
discuss these plans, or to start an

Dear Commonwoman:

A few comments on Vicki  
Smith’s article on “The Politics  
of Penile Penetration”:

I agree that there are good  
reasons for some women to  
avoid penile intercourse. These:

LETTER FROM  
THE COLLECTIVE  

The Commonwoman Collective grew out of a shared vision and a need to have a publication by and for  
Women in Vermont. We are a collective of twelve feminists with diverse lifestyles and backgrounds. We  
envision Commonwoman as a forum for feminists separated by class, politics, economics, theology, and  
sexual preference. Commonwoman is also an exploration and celebration of our similarities.

We will consider for publication all articles submitted by women. Since we wish to provide space for  
dialogue, we especially encourage letters and articles which are in response to published articles.

We are organized as a not-for-profit corporation. Management, decision making, and daily operations are  
shared by all. At this point, we are not able to pay ourselves for our work, nor can we offer money to  
contributors. A statement of our financial position is available on request, and will be printed in future  
issues... LET’S DEPEND ON EACH OTHER!

COMMONWOMAN an uncommon newspaper.

As The Movement Moves

It says here in the National Enquirer  
that the Average Housewife is  

impacted by us left -  

Response to  

include the possibility of  

unwanted pregnancy, the  
transmittal of disease, the  
increased likelihood of  
developing cervical cancer (in  

very young women), and — most  
important — the fact that many  
women (and all women at times)  
do not enjoy it.

However, I don’t think it’s  
that simple. Some women do  
enjoy it, as Vicki reported but  
did not write about in detail.  
They, at times, enjoy it more  
than other forms of sexual  
pleasure. Some women protect  
themselves from the risks — by  
using contraception, by choosing  
their partners carefully, and by  
not allowing semen to come in  
contact with their cervixes when  
they are young.

A few years ago women were  
oppressed by the idea that they  
should have “vaginal” orgasm. (I  
define this, incidentally, as  
something that feels vaginal —  
although Masters and Johnson  
may record electronic evidence  
that it is physiologically  
clitoral.) A “clitoral” orgasm  
was viewed as inferior.  
Fortunately, that view is now  
widely recognized within the  
feminist community as bullshit.  
But Vicki's article creates the  
opposite sort of oppression. A  
woman who especially enjoys  
vaginal penetration and is not  
always interested in direct  
clitoral stimulation may wonder  
what's wrong with her.

No sexual act should be done  
by one person to another person  
unless it is enjoyed and asked for  
in a spirit of mutual sharing.  
Traditionally, as Vicki says,  
penetration has been done to  
women as a sort of standard way  
of “making love.” We are  
growing out of that as women  
are learning what they like and  
their partners are learning to  
listen. Both sexes are starting to  
step out of their traditional roles  
in bed. Let’s not label anything  
“natural sexuality.”

To the Editors:

In responding to Vicki  
Smith’s article (“Politics of  
Penile Penetration”) I am afraid  
of falling into the accusation  
that I’m playing the Devil's  
advocate. In no way do I defend  
the “patriarchy” or the people  
who perpetuate sexual  
oppression, but I do feel that it  
is important to defend myself as  
an individual heterosexual man  
and to point out what I believe  
is a disservice to the feminist  
struggle.

Vicki Smith’s article is based  
on gross generalizations and  
presumptions, some of which  
contain elements of truth. “Men  
have the power.” I realize that in  
this society I, as a man, am  
offered significant advantages.

That does not mean I choose to  
take those advantages, whether  
they be in the job market or with  
friends or lovers. Which brings  
me to the definition of  
“intercourse.” Paraphrased,  
“intercourse = fucking =  
penetration.” Vicki Smith goes  
on to say that “intercourse”  
does not provide the necessary  
stimulation of the clitoris to  
produce orgasm in women. I  
accept the anatomical rationale  
for this statement, but not the  
conveniently narrow definition  
of “intercourse.” Yes, I enjoy  

penetration, but I also enjoy  
variations of “intercourse”  
according to the needs and  

pleasures of my partner.

I find it both presumptuous  
and maddening that Vicki Smith  
has the nerve to tell me that  
“Orgasm is the/my/. prime  
motivator and goal in sexual  
activity.” I resent the inference  
that as a heterosexual, I “value  
penetration as the only valid  
sexuality.” Would she care to  
listen to recounts of my own  
struggles to break out of the  
mold that was cast for me? I  
doubt that she is interested, as I  
doubt that I could share my  
vulnerabilities with one so  
prejudiced. But if she is not  
willing to listen to a relevant (at  
least to some of the women she  
is trying to reach) perspective,  
she can do no more than pretend  
to write, with any objectivity, an  
appeal for the re-analysis of  
women’s sexuality.

One of the clearest and  
strongest lessons I've learned has  
been from what I used to half  
jokingly refer to as “post  
orgasmic letdown;” that is, the  
profound emptiness of having  
intercourse with someone with  
whom I share little else. I, too,  
would like to forget that kind of  
intercourse.

“Fucking is ownership,  
property, dominance” is a  
catchy phrase, but is little more  
than rhetoric. I believe that  
feminists, female and male,  
would do better to examine the  
politics of sexism and sexuality  
rather than merely “fucking.”  
The former will lead us closer to  
the sources of power that  
oppress us all. The latter seems  
to lead to tangential  
presumptions and conclusions as  
to how other people feel, think,  
act, etc. It represents an insult  
not only to some undeserving  
men, but to the women who are  
able to recognize that not all  
men are “The Enemy.”

In closing, I would like to  
compliment Debi Ennis and  
“Commonwoman” for the  
article that appeared next to  
Vicki Smith’s article. The former  

provided an effective  
counterpoint.
