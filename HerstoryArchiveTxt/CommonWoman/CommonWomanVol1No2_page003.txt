VIEWPOINT / VIEWPOINTS

HANDICAPPED: A Minority Within A Minority

By Linda Gwizdak  
member of Central Vermont  
N.O.W. and the Central  
Vermont Women’s Center  

One out of six people are  
members of this large  
“minority.” This minority is  
the mentally, emotionally, and  
physically handicapped who face  
oppression every day by an  
unthinking majority. We are  
denied entrance to buildings  
which are not equipped with  
ramps or raised-print or Brailled  
elevator buttons.  

We have been barred from  
employment and some housing  
because of society's poor  
attitudes towards us. We are  
forced to get along in a world of  
cars, stairs and the majority of  
our communication is through  
the printed word or graphic arts.  

Am I saying that most people  
are bad? No. We tend to forget  
things if we do not experience  
them ourselves. For instance,  
readers of this article do not  
have to get someone to read it to  
you. When you walk into one of  
those modern buildings, you  
don’t have to worry about  
smashing your head on the nice  

artistic staircases that stick out.  
The list could go on. What most  
people take for granted, some  
must be in a constant struggle  
for the very basics of life.  

To me, oppression of the  
handicapped is similar to the  
oppression of gays. Like Jews  
and gays, the handicapped were  
gassed in Hitler’s death camps.  
Like Jews and gays, disabled  
people were “imperfect” in the  
eyes of Hitler's Master Race.  
There is one major difference  
between gay and handicap  
oppression. The handicapped  
were not hated in society like  
gays are. However, we were  
forced into “closets” of our  
own. When my sister and I were  

born blind, our parents’ friends  
thought that we should be put  
into institutions. We are  
fortunate that our parents had  
the guts to resist this pressure  
and raised us themselves. The  
schools for the blind do not  
teach the children to be  
independent where public  
schools expose the child to all  
kinds of people and situations.  
My sister went to such a school,  
and I went to public school.  

We are stereotyped. People  
think that we do not have  
brains, feelings or sexuality.  
Many of us get left out of  
activities because people think  
that we would be a burden or  
they assume that we would not  
be interested in their activities.  

We may even remind people that  

THEY could become  
handicapped so they don’t want  
to be reminded. You know, the  
old “Out of sight, out of mind”  
adage.  

It is more difficult for the  
blind gay to “come out” because  
to do so would mean loss of the  
blind community. With the  
specter of non-acceptance in  
both the blind community  
because of homosexuality and  
non-acceptance in the gay  
community because of  
blindness, it is Catch-22 and  
better to remain closeted. Then  
the hassle of dealing with  

society-at-large. For these  
reasons, the gay blind person is  
denied access to the  

communication network of the  
gay community and is doomed  
to a very isolated life.  

Last Fall, while researching  
for a paper for class, I discovered  
the horrendous lack of feminist  
written material available to the  
blind. There were even fewer  
books of interest to lesbians or  
gay men. To me, this is a gross  
violation of our Constitutional  
rights. We are denied these  
books because the places that  
record or Braille the books  
either are too poor to do  
everything or they don’t like the  
subject matter. These places put  
the needs of students first.  

We are all oppressed by this  
capitalistic system. If we fail to  
support ALL oppressed people,  
then we ALL lose. Education is  
the key to getting people’s  

support. I not only have to  
educate people daily about my  
blindness, but I also educate  
people about my lesbianism. I  
have hit more brick walls on  
account of blindness than I've  

ARE FEMINISTS  

AGEIST?  

By Alverta Perkins  

Feminists, exquisitely aware of the oppression of women,  
working, hoping for the Revolution and the freedom of ALL  
women, are ageist!  

It does not seem unrealistic to believe that although feminists  
are very much in tune with sexism, racism and even to a lesser  
extent, classism, they have yet to deal with ageism. Feminists are  
not immune to believing many of the feeble stereotypes that  
abound about the older woman. Feminists have succumbed to  
many of the same old clichés about older sisters as have people  
everywhere, even alas, the older sister herself. Although older  
women are as different individually as are their younger sisters,  
feminists fall into the trap of categorizing and stereotyping them  
as a minority group as does our society as a whole.  

Many women who are actively involved in the Women’s  
Movement have shown a decided curiosity about what brings an  
older woman to the movement. Since a great majority of women  
active in the movement are in their early 30’s or younger, the  
very few older (50+) women are somewhat of an oddity.  
Sometimes the curiosity of the younger woman seems to stem  
from fears and concerns about their own inevitable old age. Other  
times the curiosity is a real interest in a lifestyle that differs quite  
drastically from their mother’s or from their own experiences.  
However, too often, once the curiosity is satisfied, the younger  
feminist goes about the concerns of the movement largely  
ignoring the potential input of the older woman. They thus  
perpetuate what our society dictates: Put the older people on the  
shelf, they are out-of-it.  

Feminists believe the same stereotypes that do all people. One  
of these is that older women are “set in their ways.” It is believed  
that they do not or cannot understand the “new” ways and  
thoughts be it ideology or child rearing. In other words they  
cannot change. This ignores the fact that almost any older woman  
coming to the Women’s Movement has undergone a whole lot of  
changing already.  

Menopause is another area in which misconceptions about the  
older woman are plentiful. Younger women seem to have a fear  
and a horror of the menopause. The notion still abides, even in  
the heart of a feminist, that somehow life is horrible at  
menopause and even worse, it signifies the end of the good life  
and the start of a downhill course. A menopausal woman is  
thought to be depressed, suffering and sorrowing. A feminist  
defines a woman by biology much as do others.  

Other untrue stereotypes are that the older woman is asexual,  
lonely and suffering from the “empty nest syndrome.” The  
University of Nebraska found that older people were way down  
on the list of people with whom loneliness was a problem. College  
students were first! Older women do not attend meetings because  
they have nothing else to do and are seeking company.  

Lest it seem that all the blame for ageism is put on the younger  
woman, it must be said that the older woman can be as ageist as  
the younger. One of the characteristics of a minority group is  
group hatred. Older women see in each other all of the negative  
aspects that they have been led to believe. They too believe the  
clichés even though their own lives deny the truth of them. They  
too can see the older woman as no longer valuable and at the  
bottom of the status heap. Their concept of their older sister, no  
matter how wrong, reinforces their own negative self-image.  

Some feminists are beginning to examine their own feelings  
and misunderstandings about the older woman. As hopefully  
more middle-aged and older women come into the movement,  

ageism will lessen. Older women are oppressed daily, by the world  

around them, by feminists and by themselves. All feminists must  
come to recognize that “oldness” is a political institution and a  
social convention.  

COMMONWOMAN is for you  

hit for being gay!  

As feminists, we must throw  
away our fears of handicapped  
people because we are your  
sisters too. We must have a true  
sisterhood if we are to survive.  
We will NEVER be truly  
liberated until we lose our  
hang-ups about sex, looks and  
racism.  

Limitations  

the choices I have made  
drape my body  

like Spanish moss  

thick gray strands  

set in motion  

when I walk  

sway as I walk  

like gray ghosts  

I meet you  

for the first time  
want you to taste me  
raw and fresh  

as wild mint  

I begin to dance for you  
quickly  

so you cannot tell  

how I am shaped  
cannot tell  

that I bear imprints  

like well-used leather  
well-loved  

Standing still now  

I watch your eyes adjust  
to the shadows  

that surround me  

can you, too,  

hear the other voices  
echo as I speak?  

I watch  

weary  

your eyes go wild  

with suspicion  

you tempt me  

to tear away  

these flimsy strands  
one hand claws the air  
the other  

clings to my gray limits  

wait  

before you go for good  
come here  

and glide with me  

to freedom  

On one brief burst  
of laughter
