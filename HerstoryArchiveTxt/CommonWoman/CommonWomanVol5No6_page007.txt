COMMONWOMAN DECEMBER, 1981

Guatemala

By Elena  
The following is a small  
excerpt from a long article about  
living in Guatemala. It was  

mostly written during 1978-79,  
before the current military situa-  

“secretions” had much  

village. I left Pacelin Abaj at the  
beginning of 1981, when fourteen  
truckloads of soldiers set up  
camp on a soccer field about two  
km away, and lived in nearby  
San Lucas for six more months,  
watching the situation widen  
and worsen.  

Living in Guatemala this  
past year gave me a sense of  
what living in Nazi Germany  
might have been like, for one  
whose life wasn’t personally  
threatened (and who lived in a  
quiet neighborhood). Life goes  

on as usual. Every day the  
newspapers are full of alarming  
stories. Students, professors,  
doctors machine-gunned. Tor-  

tured bodies found along the  
roadsides. “The Cadavers of  
Mazate are the Kidnapped Plan-  
tation Workers of Reu.”  
“Twelve Tortured Bodies found  
in Abandoned House in Zone  
11,” Life goes on, you don’t  
read the papers every day, the  
sun shines. You hear rumors of  
even worse atrocities; everyone  
knows that what gets printed is  
only the tip of the iceberg. You  
hear ominous sounds of guns in  
the night, see groups of soldiers  
parading along the roads, hear  
whispered conversations in the  
houses of neighbors. The bus  
you are in is stopped, the men  
are made to dismount and be  
frisked, some don’t return. More  
and more people you know are  
personally affected; a son or  
brother killed, a neighbor kid-  
napped. You file these facts  
away and go on with your daily  
life.  

Shortly before leaving  
Guatemala, I walked to Patzun,  
one of the many beautiful  
highland Indian villages. There  
were few people in the market-  

place, a strange quality of  
silence. Two days earlier, in  
broad daylight, a car with four  
masked men in it had driven up,  
a woman had been singled  
out from among a group of  
women standing in the plaza, her  
baby had been thrown to the  
ground and she had been hustled  
into the car, which had then  
proceeded to drive around town  
that way, as if to flaunt the  
capacity of these killers to do  
anything. Then the car drove  

off, and some days or weeks  
later, the woman's tortured  
body was found somewhere  

along the roadside.  

Well, there are all kinds of  
horror stories coming from all  
parts of the world, and if one  
pauses too long at them one  
risks being engulfed in despair,  
and certainly it does little good  
to dwell on them. But this  
particular one has haunted me.  
What if I’d been there that  
afternoon? What if I'd been  
there in the pretty flower-filled  
plaza, admiring the beautiful  
embroidered clothing of the  
people, and the pleasing distant  
perspective of fields and forests?  
What would I have done? Stood  
there like everyone else and  
watched in horror knowing that  
to intervene would only mean  
losing my life as well as hers?  

The longer I stayed in  
Guatemala, the more I was  
touched personally by what was  
happening. Fiesta de Santiago  
Atitlan, August 1980. Santiago  
Atitlan is one of the most  
beautiful villages in Guatemala,  

with a jewel's setting between lake  

and volcanos. Both men and  
women wear rainbow-colored  
handwoven garments, lavishly  
embroidered with fantastic  
birds. During fiesta, everyone is  
even more beautiful than usual.  
I sit on the market steps watching  
the passing parade of radiant  
smiling people. Suddenly there is  
a silence. In the center of the  
silence, some 12-15 soldiers  
in brown and green camouflage  
outfits, helmets, guns with  
bayonets, blank faces. Then  
another silence on the other side  
of them and Fiesta de Atitlan  
resumes, gaudy and gala. It  
happens so fast, you almost  
wonder if you dreamed it. But  
later the same day, it happens  
again, and again. Are they the  
same soldiers? Different ones?  
How many groups are there?  
Their presence is so incongruous  
that it is easy to forget them  
when they are not directly in  
eyeshot, but we have all seen  
this television show before, and  
we know all too well what the  
next episode is. Sure enough,  
some six months later, several  
dozen Indians working in a  
coffee grove are collected and  
murdered, apparently in retalia-  
tion for a guerilla raid on an  
army convoy, though it is not  
even pretended that these  
Indians have had anything to do  
with the raid. But the guerillas  
are gone and Indian lives are  
expendable. In the preceding  
months, the army had occupied  
an area just outside of town and  
set up camp there, destroyed the  
radio station, killed a number of  
people and harassed any number  
of others, and terrorized the  
whole village by issuing lists of  
people to be killed. One visits a  
friend and learns that she must  

go to a distant town to fetch the  
tortured body of her husband,  
dropped there from a helicopter.  

One leaves Guatemala  
shaken, and returns to the  
United States. One learns that  
the situation is even worse than  
one knew. Far worse. The  
facts compiled by Amnesty  
International and other groups  
are sickening. That the U.S. is  
supporting the Lucas govern-  
ment is truly monstrous. That  
we should be contributing in any  
way to the activities of this  
government, instead of applying  
all our strength against it, mocks  
any pretensions the U.S. might  
have of being a moral country.  
Communism couldn't possibly  
be any more oppressive than the  
current regime, and I have it on  
reliable report that things are a  
lot better in Nicaragua, despite  
much poverty and the after-  
effects of devastation. There are  
many people who don’t much  
like the Sandinista government,  
but they’re saying so out loud,  
which is more than people dare  
in Guatemala. The atmosphere  
of oppression in Guatemala is  
enormous. The government now  
has a huge literacy program  
going, which is very commend-  
able except that all public  
employees must devote some  
fifteen hours a week to it,  
without pay. Those who have  
protested have been found dead,  
which seems to be the only  
way the Lucas government deals  
with its critics. (A government  
official lugubriously joked that  
there are no political prisoners in  
Guatemala, they are all dead.)  
There is no way to protest the  
government's policies, nor any  
legitimate opposition, because  
all who might participate in such  
opposition are killed. (Large  
numbers of others are killed  
anyway, just because killing is  
happening, especially Indians,  
whose lives count for nothing.)  

I went to Guatemala to  
write about cultural imperialism  
(among other things), but that  
situation, which is the reality of  
all Third World countries today,  
quickly loses significance when  
people are being slaughtered  
wholesale. I exhort you all to  
write to Reagan and your  
congresspeople expressing your  
opposition to U.S. support of  
the Guatemalan government in  
the strongest terms possible, for  
it is U.S.-made arms and equip-  
ment (cleverly channeled  
through countries like Israel and  
Argentina) that are making the  
killing possible.

Argentina.  
By Robin Loyd  

The people of Argentina  
have for a number of years faced  
a terrifying secret police  
technique: the authorities don’t  
simply arrest people and put  
them in jail or torture them;  
they ‘disappear’ them: they  
arrange to have their opposition  
whisked away in unmarked cars  
by plainclothesmen — and  
nothing is ever seen or heard  
from their victims.  

In the United States under  
Reagan, we are faced with the  
same technique, used more sub-  
tly in the destruction of human  
rights standards that have been  
part of U.S. foreign policy. As  
Cindy Buhl, Co-Director and  
Human Rights Coordinator for  
the Coalition for a New Foreign  
and Military Policy wrote in a  
statement prepared for Human  
Rights Week (Dec. 6-13):  
“Today in the United States, we  
are faced with an Administration  
dedicated to the disappearance  
of human rights standards  
in U.S. foreign policy and the  
eradication of their existence in  

U.S. public law.”  

The Reagan team has  
repeatedly emphasized “quiet  
diplomacy” as its favorite  

method of promoting human  
rights. But, as Cindy Buhl states:  
“by forsaking public statements  
in support of human rights,  
increasing Fiscal Year ‘82  
foreign military aid one billion  
dollars (that’s one thousand  
million!!!) over the last year  
(and decreasing economic aid by  
26%), reviving cordial relation-  
ships with such human rights  
offenders as Chile, South Africa,  
Guatemala, vigorously  

and  

attacking human rights laws and  
leaving vacant the key human  
rights advocacy post in the State  
Department for over 9 months,  
any hope for quiet diplomacy  
to succeed has been severely  
undermined.”  

What do you do — what do  
we do — when the president  
breaks the very laws he is  
charged with upholding? A case  
in point is the President’s  
approval on June 5th of $3.2  
million in trucks and jeeps for  
the Guatemalan military. Now  
there is a U.S. law prohibiting  
the sale of such articles to  
rights-violating countries. The  
President simply circumvented  
these provisions by removing the  
jeeps and trucks from the  
munitions list subject to law. He  
justified this by proclaiming that  
“U.S. security assistance will  
enhance our human rights  
efforts.” We are truly in the age  
of doublespeak. How military  
aid will accomplish this goal  
when put in the hands of troops  
which, according to the interna-  
tional Commission of Jurists are  
renowned for massacre, assassi-  

nation, and torture, is not  
discussed.  
On Saturday, Dec. 12th,  

Bright Morning Star will perform  

a benefit for CISPES at the  
Unitarian church. ($4 at the  
door) And on Monday, Dec. 14,  
Father Jesus Nieto, former close  
co-worker with Msgr. Oscar  
Romero, will speak on religions  
in El Salvador at 7:30 pm,  
McCarthy Arts Center, St.  
Mikes.
