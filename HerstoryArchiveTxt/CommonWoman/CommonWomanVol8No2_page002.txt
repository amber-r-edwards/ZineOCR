When you post an
announcement of a meeting,
political rally or demonstration
on a local bulletin board, do you
ever get the feeling that someone
is watching? When you attend a
political meeting, do you ever
wonder if there are infiltrators —
informants — present? Paranoia?
Not according to Captain Kevin
Scully of the Burlington Police
Department.

In a panel discussion held in
mid-January to discuss police
surveillance in the city of
Burlington, Captain Scully said
that he does send someone to
surveil the University of Ver-
mont and other community
bulletin boards. He also admit-
ted to sending informants to
political meetings. Indeed,
according to Captain Scully, it is
the constitutional right of his
people to attend such meetings,
whether their purpose is to
support the cause at hand or to
gather information. That is, to
spy.

And furthermore, if a meet-
ing is announced with the
express purpose of ‘planning an
action of civil disobedience —
peaceful or otherwise — you
may be sure that the Burlington
Police will be there, under cover.

Protesting in Vermont — 
Should A Record Be Kept?

The panel discussion was
held at St. Paul’s Cathedral and
was sponsored by the Commu-
nity Council of Greater Burling-
ton. The luncheon/discussion
was attended principally by
middle-aged, apparently middle-
class members of the commu-
nity, people who are probably
very concerned about First
Amendment rights but were
willing to leave the hard ques-
tions to members of the press, a
strong presence at the discus-
sion.

The topic arose from the
disclosure by Mayor Sanders last
June that police had been
video-taping a peace march
through the city of Burlington
and a rally that followed. In a
display of outrage at such a
violation of the right to demon-
strate peaceably and without
harassment, Sanders denounced
the police action to television
cameras at the rally. The dis-
closure attracted the attention
of civil rights and other commu-
nity groups and was given a good
deal of media coverage.

Two days later, when
demonstrators staged a sit-in at
the General Electric plant in the
south end of Burlington, police
were back with their cameras as
was the mayor. The target of the
protest was a shipment of guns
leaving the GE plant destined
for right-wing government forces
in El Salvador.

Panel members were Kevin
Bradley, Chittenden County
State’s Attorney, a former police
captain and the initiator of the
police videotaping, and Burling-
ton Police Captain Kevin Scully,
a graduate of the FBI Academy,
who spoke in defense of the
video-taping. Nancy Powell,
UVM graduate and member of
the local chapter of the Women’s
International League for Peace
and Freedom (WILPF), a group
involved in the GE protest, and
Scott Skinner, the director of
the Vermont chapter of the
American Civil Liberties Union
(ACLU) in Montpelier, spoke
against.

There seemed to be little
concern among panel members
about the video-taping of the GE
sit-in, a self-described unlawful
action which was also an-
nounced to the public in ad-
vance. What was of concern was
the video-taping of a peaceful
and lawful march and the
retention of the tapes or the
keeping of files on local peace
activists.

State’s Attorney Bradley
defended the video-taping of the
march by saying that he had
access to information which
indicated there might be trouble
at the parade from counter-
demonstrators and that there
was fear that violence would
erupt. When the counter-
demonstrators did not material-
ize, the tapes of the march and
rally were eventually destroyed.
Tapes of the GE demonstration,
however, have been retained. The
need for these tapes was said to
be for training police for demon-
strations. Bradley and Scully
both emphasized the importance
of such tapes should charges of
police brutality be made by the
demonstrators, to protect the
police in possible lawsuits. They
will be destroyed at some future
date when the police no longer
deem them necessary for their
protection. Although the audi-
ence seemed to have no problem
with their having been made,
there was evidence of unrest at
the knowledge that they were
still held by police. Scully
assured the audience that no
files existed on the demonstra-
tors other than normal police
files when the arrests of the
demonstrators were made.

Skinner responded to Brad-
ley's claim of possible violence
as a motive for the taping by
pointing out that there is no
organized resistance to the peace
movement in the state of Ver-
mont, and thus the taping of the
march and rally was totally
unnecessary. And as for using
the tapes to train police, he said
that there were many tapes
available nationwide for such
training and that there was no
need for local police to make
their own.

As to the validity of such
tapes in the courtroom due to
the subjective position of the
cameramen — the camera could
“look away” or certain footage
could be erased if brutality did
occur — Scully and Bradley both
admitted that the tapes were of
course subjective. Curiously
though, Bradley seemed to think
that the question indicated bias
against the police. Moderator
Anthony Lamb, a private attor-
ney in Burlington, indicated that
the court would take into
consideration such bias when
presented with such tapes as
evidence in a lawsuit.

Powell attacked the video-
taping on the grounds of its
effects on demonstrators. “We
will never know how many
people are intimidated by the
record-keeping of the police,”
she said. And Skinner spoke of
the “chilling effect” of video-
taping, its inhibition of First
Amendment rights.

The hard questions:

Indeed, this was a chilling
incident in the history of Bur-
lington leftist politics. Those of
us committed to the creation of
a different society have grown
used to the fear that the FBI
photographs us at rallies, at
demonstrations, perhaps inter-
cepts our mail, taps our phones.
But the Burlington police?

And what does such activity
do to our movement? Not only
does it probably keep people
away, as Powell suggested, but
what of the paranoia that
results, our suspicions, our edgi-
ness that affects our relation-
ships with each other?

The surveillance of activists
is a contradiction of the First
Amendment. I felt a chill when
Captain Scully defended the
constitutional right of informers
to attend our meetings. And
later felt dismayed that no one
had challenged the statement.
When police claim to have a
constitutional right to spy on us,
we had better have another look
at what it means to exercise
the right of assembly, and the
rights of police, the FBI, to spy.
It isn’t a principle I would want
to test in a Reagan court, but
certainly we need to keep the
discussion open about the role
of internal espionage in a society
that professes to be open.

And what of the objectivity
of a court investigating a charge
of police brutality when present-
ed with videotapes of arrests
with no shots of such brutality?
Do demonstrators carry with
them expensive cameras to
record otherwise? Memories of
police attacks on television
cameras at a pro-separatist rally
in Montreal haunt me. Are we to
accept the objectivity of a
court presented with the tape of
the defendants when the plain-
tiffs have no such strong evi-
dence? What of the truism that
one picture is worth a thousand
words?

And, finally, a question
raised by a woman sitting next
to me at the discussion, but
unfortunately never asked of the
State’s Attorney or the police
captain, a question that should
have been on every journalist’s
mind: What if the mayor had
not discovered the video-
cameras? What if the mayor
were not easily outraged by the
violation of civil rights? Would
there now be files on every
demonstrator? Permanent files?
Would the peace march files
never have been destroyed with-
out the media attention? Next
time, will the police have learned
better to disguise themselves?
