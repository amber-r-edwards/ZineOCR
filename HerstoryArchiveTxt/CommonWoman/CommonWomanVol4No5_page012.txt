I came across this scarf one day  
bloodied  
and wondered what woman had left it there  
and how she came to bleed.  

I cry a little every day  
for my sisters  

robbed, beaten,  

raped.  

Hurt at the will of a man  
slain by his hands.  

I turned the scarf over to the police  
who seemed unimpressed  

though they'd found a knife there  
just the other day.  

Women come to me  
bruised, broken,  

to pick up the pieces  

of a life forever changed  
by the feel of his knife  

and the hatred in his eyes.  

Did he hurt her badly,  

I wonder,  

or will the scars she carries all be inside  
where only she has to look.  

Where was I  

when my sister was bleeding  
if I could have been there  

this shattered woman  
weeping in my arms  
might still be whole.  

I saw the body of a sister today  
bloodied  
and wondered what man had left her so  
and how she came to die.

MARCH ON  

The armies marched today.  
Across the country  

they marched;  

for their wounded, their maimed,  
their dead.  

The armies marched today.  
Carrying the banners of  
their communities,  

six abreast down the street  
they marched.  

The armies marched today.  
Shouting, chanting, angry  
they marched;  

fists raised high  

against their enemies.  

The armies marched today.  
And yesterday and tomorrow  
they march;  

until there is justice,  

until they walk free and safe.  

The armies march today.  
Armies of women  

they marched;  

for their rights, their safety,  

their lives.  
The armies marched today.  

Sisters hand in hand,  
they marched.  

In love and anger,  
they marched.  

For freedom,  

they marched.  

In hope for peace,  
they marched,  

for all of us,  

they marched.  

March on.

POETRY  

BEFORE MORNING  

anger is such in this  

rudimentary house  

that I awaken,  

stumbling to you  

whose naked eyes scan  

my most disturbing gazes.  

red warmth engages in a dimness  
elegant as your bones,  

round and skin softened.  

how much of this humid blizzard  
can one pour on another?  

solidified, condemned, twisted  
sounds of a dark night lacking  
music, without the gentle  
notification of hell arising,  
our eyes pried open to  
what experience:  
gates colliding, our skin  
burnt together, echoes of  
bones breaking, hands amputated.  
our eyes are to experience in sleep  
that which is untouchable  
in the bronze blazing morning  
of summer.

NIGHT IN JULY  

walking, without you, this night,  
returning to only the solitary moon  

is not enough.  

we were strange vines crawling within  
a dampness,  
old bells declaring a vivid wooden strength.  

to thrive in this house is to acknowledge  
roles of the observer, the wanderer.  

the rattling of the body beneath love,  
thin slices of a distant thunderstorm.  

out of ourselves, easily it would be  
to move hardly examining  
language’s sultry energy changing  
into dark, winter leaves.  

in this there is an uttering, a cry.  
a woman twice my age walks jagged sidewalks,  
tiny dewdrops reflected in eyes, and I call,  
in heart to yesterday’s lover, but there is  
no reply. only a soft, cold body,  
opening, where I have existed,
