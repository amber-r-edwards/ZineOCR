‘But where does my love go?  

Is it absorbed into your dream?  

You never touch me when I sleep.  
ERATE OMA TE,  

Changing now  
twist and turn your mind.  

Alice, Alice  
alone inside  
with changes that you find.  

Your outward looks  
refract back.  
A mirror meets your stare.  

Make the  
Chittenden  
a part of your  
life.  

Alice, Alice  

come on through.  

Life is waiting there.

Facts  

The boy builds the House of God  
from Playdough  

using his half-price pump  

and mixing the red, yellow, and blue  
showing me where the slide is  

for baby Jesus to play (how  

does he involve himself in these stories  
of gods?) and where the snakes  
come out in the night. Primary  
colors mix; Christ topples  

into the imagination, memories  
straighten themselves out  

and walk on the mushy moldings.  
Mottled, mashed with my thoughts  
I see the child's delight  

making the loops and curlicues  
connect and blend. Creator  

makes world for Creator  

and the half-price fare  

is just another mistaken impression:  
what we see going on  

is first a set of facts  

getting human and formed;  

taken through the slides  
underground and back  

we build up from our allowance.

Ease  

I  

Baked, soil packed firm,  

in sun streaks bathed  

I stretched toward you:  
Obsessed, blinded, bending.  

Once there, the fingers of your fist  

unclenched to examine the petals, the stem,  

to ride the stalk down  

and search for the roots  

to rip open the petals one by one  
and straddle the stem.  

Petals into granulated soil  
clustered earth breaking apart  
particles of soul sticking  
stem to denuded stem.  

Roots that could have grown down  
afloat at the top of a jar.  

Choked and strangled threads  
unburied, untended  

denied their watery berth.  

Come to me and bring your tools,  
put me in a garlanded boat  
and row me underneath the Earth.  

Come to me and bring your tools:  
touch a cool spade to parched sand,  
green water-pools of your eyes  
guide a hand  

to maimed and withered branches.  

Beloved friend  

eternal gardener of my psyche  
only you can close the circle of  
my pain.  

Come to me, heal me.  

Pull my roots back into your dark and supple soil.
