COMMONWOMAN MAY, 1981

By Carol Cohen  
Wimmin must save the pla-  
net. That’s the message I’ve been  
receiving from the outside world  
and from my own internal  
workings. Even those who do  
not want to particularly separate  
themselves from the patriarchy  
like Grace Paley and Helen  
Caldicott have gotten up on the  
podium in Burlington this past  
year and clearly made appeals to  
the wimmin in the audience to  
take action. But I think we need  
to do more than directly con-  
front the men who are raping  
our land, although that task is  
hard enough. Perhaps it’s too  
late, but I know, to preserve my  
sanity, I need to keep working  
on improving my own personal  
relationship with the natural  
world. I have to believe that we  
wimmin have not lost our touch.  
We can still talk to the birds,  
hear messages in the waters, play  
with the moon like the good  
witches we are. We must learn to  
make love with the rocks and  
the light. We must do more than  
just leave our Mother alone; we  
must fondle her, stroke her, help  

bugs. We've got to get through  
the bug paranoia we've inherited  
from the patriarchy before we  
can truly feel comfortable out-  
doors. Most of us have learned  
to be so tense around insects  
that we'd as soon kill them as  
take a look at them. An inno-  
cent honeybee in search of a  
flower can throw us into a  
paralysis of fear. “Don’t move  
and it won't sting,” we are  
warned. So there we sit, frozen,  
our eyes bugging out of our  
heads watching a minute crea-  
ture terrorize our lives. Or we  
feel an ant crawling over us, a fly  
land on our bare skin; and we  
flail away, using enormous force  
to smash the critter to smither-  
eens. Perhaps bugs touch off the  
ultimate in paranoia because  
they can invade our very bodies,  
the only beings in the world who  
can literally get inside of us and  
chew away. (How many of you  
are getting the creeps as I so  
much as mention the possibi-  
lity?) And it’s true. Not all bugs  
treat us well, but in my opinion  
the patriarchy has overreacted  
with its DDT and stories of  
marauding locusts that most of  
us have ceased to appreciate  
their incredible beauty and carry  
around an abhorrence for insects  
way out of proportion to the  
actual harm they do.  

I used to hate bugs, too, but  
about seven years ago while  
teaching environmental educa-  
tion in public school I dis-  
covered a type of microscope  
often used by jewelers under  
which I could put an opaque  
object and see things blown up  
to thirty times its size rather  
than three or four hundred  
times. When I placed a bug  
under that stereoscope, all of a  
sudden I could see the facets on  

the lens of a compound eye, the  
tarsal claws of a hornet, the  
clubbed antennae of some bee-  
tles, the scales on the wings of  
a butterfly, the baskets of pollen  
on the back of a bee's leg —  
filmy underwings, furred abdo-  
mens, segments and segments of  
foolishness and horror, ghoulish-  
ness and awe.  
Over the past year, though,  
I have changed my process  
around bug study. Most text-  
books and field guides (written  
by men, of course)  
recommend killing, collecting, preserv-  
ing; but I found that every time  
I scooped up in my collecting jar  
a beautiful bug that had caught  
my eye in the wilderness I felt a  
tinge of regret. And one day last  
summer while camping with a  
few very conscious friends of  
mine, they told me how repulsed  
they were by these acts of  
brutality against creatures I so  
admired. At first I defended  
myself claiming that the insect  
population was so numerous  
that I didn’t have to feel badly  
about killing just one — there  
was no danger of wiping out the  
point. Since then I’ve learned a  
lesson in the light touch, in slow  
gentle approaches knowing that  

the ultimate in paranoia is also some of the lacks in tradi-  
tional psychotherapeutic  
approaches to abuse.  
Incest victims may be of  
both sexes, but the perpetrators  
are overwhelmingly male. As a  
psychotherapist, I see many  
dynamics involved, but as a  
feminist therapist, I see the  
power dynamics to be central in  
explaining why the sexual abuser  
is hardly ever female.  

Let’s look at the “portrait”  
provided of the typical abusing  
father. He is said to be insecure,  
withdrawn and morally opposed  
to or afraid of extra-familial  
adultery. Aren’t there many,  
description? Why don’t they  
turn to sexual relations with  
their sons much more frequently  
than it seems that they do?  

My answer would be that  
there is a missing element in the  
above psychological profile. And  
mandated to exercise power over  
the female members with no  
termove from wife.  
We need to clarify incest  
is, on rape. Just as it’s been proven  
that rape is not the act of a  
sexually deprived male, but  
rather of a male expressing  
violence and anger towards  
women, so too, the sexually  
abusive male is expressing power  
(and maybe anger, too) as well  
as his own feelings of inade-  
quacy as an adult male. It may  
often be true that there is a  
blocked sexual relationship in  
the marriage, but there is pro-  
bably always a blocked power  
relationship: with wife, others,  
employment, etc. If the chief  
motivation were to find an  
“acceptable” sexual outlet with-  
in the family, then wouldn’t the  
main victims be nubile adoles-  
cents rather than 9- to 11-year-  
old girls?  

Before further proving my  
point, the question arises, ‘Why  
is this important?” The recent  
debate in Commonwoman over  
writing about men and male  
relationships brings up the issue:  
Does the female victim really  
need to understand the motiva-  
tions of her oppressor? I say yes,  
the struggle to free  
oneself proceeds best with as  
much information as possible.

that would be the firm belief  
details I go to the library where I  
can find out more than I ever  
knew about bugs. I’m much more  
patient from daughter or coun-  
selor just as we've needed to educate

(The following is an edited  
transcript of a conversation with  
Bobbi, who does not hold a  
salaried job, but does housework  
in her home and volunteer work  
in her community. The mother  
of one daughter, Bobbi married  
at 17 and spent the first years of  
her marriage working at a paid  
job and doing housework at  
home.)  
DIAN: Did your husband  
do any of the housework while  
you were both working?  
BOBBI: Oh, no. That was  
30 years ago, and that wasn’t  
done.  
DIAN: Did you stop work-  
ing outside the home when you  
had your daughter?  
BOBBI: I worked before I had her, and then she  
was, oh, probably three when I  
went back to work. And I pretty  
much worked outside the home  
until about 15, 16 years ago. I  
stopped working only because I  
had this instinct that said I  
wanted to stay home and take  
care of my nest, rather than  
going out and working. Working  
provided me with the financial  
means to do projects at the  
house, but it did not provide me  
with the time. I got to the point  
where the time was more impor-  
tant to me than the money. It  
gives me a great deal of pleasure,  
a great deal of joy to have a  
clean, sparkling house, to have  
one that is arranged in the way I  
like. I also go so far as to do the  
painting — that to me is part of  
keeping the house.  
I enjoy not duplicating  
Better Homes and Gardens type  
of thing, but bringing my own  
personality into my home. I feel  
that my home is an extension of  
myself, and it’s a way of express-  
ing my joys and the things that I  
appreciate. I take a great deal of  
pleasure in being in a safe, com-  
fortable, pleasant place.  
DIAN: And you don’t mind  
doing the work yourself? Be-  
cause there are a lot of people  
who enjoy being in a place that's  
fairly clean, fairly neat and is a  
pleasant place to be, but there  
aren’t many people who enjoy  
doing the work that’s involved in  
making it that way. Do you have  
a schedule for doing housework?  
BOBBI: No... It is a high  
priority to be flexible. Relation-  
ships within the family, for  
instance, are more important  
than housework.  

DIAN: For many years,  
housework is a job with no  
vacations and no retirement.  
What do you think about that?  

BOBBI: I think it’s desper-  
ately unfair. I think when the  
man retires, the housework that  
has to be done should be shared.  
Just because a woman has  
washed dishes and made beds for  
45 years, doesn’t mean that he  
can't learn to do that, if he  
doesn't already know.  
DIAN: You say that you  
enjoy housework. When I was  
first married and taking care of  
the house and children and so  
forth, I didn’t enjoy it.  
BOBBI: I didn’t then,  
either. I resented the hell out of  
it. I don't know whether I  
resented having to go out and  
work, or whether I resented  
having to do a second job when  
I got home. I think my daughter  
has a better home than I did,  
because now it’s acceptable for  
her husband to do some of the  
work at home.  
DIAN: How do you feel  
about the fact that women who  
work for their families — who  
clean house and cook for their  
families — do not ever get paid?  
And they’re not accumulating  
Social Security or paying into a  
pension fund.  
BOBBI: I think that marri-  
age should be a mutual situation,  
and a woman is contributing just  
as much to that marriage whe-  
ther she works outside the home  
or not. If she isn’t working at a  
paying job, the man should  
make provisions for her retire-  
ment. There are retirement  
funds that can be set up for  
non-working spouses.  

I get angry when I think of  
women who have worked to  
maintain the home and the  
family for years and years and  
then when their husbands  
divorce them, they're left with  
nothing. I think that’s grossly  
unfair. I think that the man  
should be forced, if he won't do  
it voluntarily, to take care of her  
while she gains the skills to take  
care of herself. I think that she  
has spent all these years attend-  
ing to his needs, attending to the  
family’s needs, and thereby not  
looking after her own self, and  
I think that in turn she deserves at  
least a chance to gain some skills  
and find a job so that she can  
provide for herself, without  
having to worry about maybe  
going in to do housework for  
someone else, because that’s the  
only thing she knows how to do.  
DIAN: I think that probab-  
ly most people don’t enjoy  
housework because it gets to be
