Note From the Collective

Note from the Collective

The Commonwoman Collective is excited by the response to
our newspaper. We are, however, aware of certain problems in our
editorial process such as how we select, solicit and edit copy. In
our January issue we plan to include a more detailed letter from
the Collective elaborating on these and other problems. In the
meantime thank you for your support and encouragement.

COMMONWOMAN an uncommon newspaper. |

Sign of the times

you can't

possibly
be shocked

from Kristina

Berster

I want to express my shocked
feelings about the
“trustworthiness” of United
States Attorney Gray. The
stipulation concerning my
staying in or passing through
two countries where I had not
been subject to persecution had
not been made in order to hide
the fact that I had travelled in
those countries, as Mr. Gray had
known their names all during the
trial. The stipulation was
requested by me to protect
myself from further
pre-sentencing and overkill by
the mass media, particularly the
West German press.

In my situation — being
labelled as a suspected terrorist
— a mere association with
countries like South Yemen and
Libya would be enough to
convict me on circumstantial
evidence in Germany. In other
words, I would be found guilty
in the atmosphere of panic in
West Germany where the
overwhelming majority of the
population, including the
authorities, think about these
countries only as “havens and
breeding grounds for terrorists.”
Now, of course, the question
arises — why have I been to
South Yemen? As set forth in
my testimony, I have lived since
1973 as a refugee. This cut me
off from all of society's
institutions and forced me to do
the most menial and unfulfilling
jobs. Upon finding a possibility
of meaningful and humanitarian
work — which, given my
circumstances, was impossible
for me in Europe as well as in
most other countries — I was
given an opportunity to work
for some months with the
Omani Red Cross. I was
responsible for organizing and
sorting the medical supplies
which were received from all
over the world. Therefore, much
of my job consisted of
classifying and distributing the
medical material. Libya was only
a transient place and the most
economical access to South
Yemen, as such access is very
limited and extremely expensive.
I shall continue my efforts to
remain in the United States
where I hope to find equally
meaningful work. I trust that
many people will continue to
support my efforts to do so
through my defense committee.

With Love

To the Editor:

I am submitting this letter to
you with hopes that it will
appear in Commonwoman, even
though its message is really quite
personal. This letter is a kind of
summation of my experiences in
the women’s community here in
Burlington.

Being in an academic
environment has telling effects.
For one thing, you are
conditioned into believing that
you must produce both an
analysis and summary for each
period of your life.

Categorization and
compartmentalization become
second nature, especially for
emotional experiences. For
example, this letter is an analysis
of the process of loving and
learning to cope with loss.
Emotions are irrational things —
analysis seems to make them
more intellectually acceptable. It
puts the proverbial handle on
them, almost making them a
tangible object that can be
observed and studied from a
variety of perspectives.

The point is that this kind of
treatment of an irrational topic
is, in itself, irrational.
Retrospective analysis negates
the spontaneity of feeling. Too
much is forgotten, or repressed.
Language is an inadequate
medium for the expression of
emotion because it is too simple
to express the complexities of
emotion. But, language is the
only tool for expression we
have, when presences cannot be
shared. I’ve learned to live with
its inadequacies.

I'm leaving in a few weeks,
and have been thinking about
my life in Burlington. I’ve found
a place for myself in the
women’s community, and have
been warmed by it. It is a
natural, elemental community
that balances conflict and
harmony. I think I finally
understand why “Mother”
Nature is female.

A women’s community is
filled with energy. The source of
that energy is the women who
compose the community. The
name of that energy does not
exist in our language. The
experience of this energy cannot
be described simply as love, or
power, or strength, yet these are
all part of it. This energy is not
merely positive — hate, distrust,
and fear exist as well. Human
beings are sensitive selectively;
we allow ourselves to feel only
parts of this energy at a specific
time. Perhaps the total
experience of energy happens
occasionally, but it must be rare.
I think I have felt it once almost
totally. The experience defies
definition. It was simultaneously
sustaining and draining. It was
wonderful.

I have truly loved few people
in my life. I have fallen in love
and learned to settle for less
with varying degrees of success. I
have been guilty of living
through my friends. I have also
received the unqualified support
of my friends in this
community.

I have lived among you for
about a year and a half. I have
shared pain, happiness, fear, and
love with some of you. I have
been self-conscious and
comfortable. You have provided
me with a sense of place,
something I need very badly.
This is my way of saying thank
you. The love I have given and
received here will, I hope, persist
after I leave. I'll miss all of you.
You have been my life.

Role
Reversal

Commonwoman Readers:
I want to share this fantasy
vision as the intensity of deer
hunting season once again
invades my eyes, ears and
consciousness; it translates into
reality quite easily. Picture cars
driving around town with a
dummy dressed as a hunter
draped ceremoniously over the
trunk, and the driver wearing a
deer head mask. I have yet to
carry out this project myself,
but want to suggest it to all of
you who may share some of this
same dread of hunting season.

Staring
Back

I was walking down a street in
the North End with a woman
friend in mid-November. Two
high school age males were
standing by a corner store. As
we passed, the taller of the two
very obviously and blatantly
stared down at my left breast. I
felt uncomfortable and angry.
Three steps later I decided to
act. I pivoted, walked back, and
staring the guy down shoved him
a little, saying ‘How do you like
being stared at?’ He backed
away with an expression of total
astonishment on his face, I
turned and left.

On my return trip ten minutes
later, he and his friend avoided
looking at me. It felt good to
strike back. A friend has
suggested that getting the male's
attention and staring at his pants
zipper is less risky and is as
effective in making objectifying
males squirm.
