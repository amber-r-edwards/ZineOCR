It takes regrouping.  
One divided into  
is different from one divided.  
Divide one into two,  
the result is two,  
two separate and solid wholes.  
Or divide one,  
which may also be expressed,  
divide one “in” half  
and get halves, two halves,  
which taken separately are less than a whole.  
It takes rehearing,  
for the ear wants to hear holes for wholes  
and haves for halves  
so that fractions, judging by the ear,  

would sound to be more than the staunch integers:  
Picture one little apple divided  
into a pair of halves. What harm can it do?  

What difference can it make? It leaves two.  
Dismiss the idea of a bullet,  
‘one bullet passing through, that is to say,  
dividing or piercing the hearts  
of two people back to back,  
leaving no hearts at all. Similarly,  

in proliferating the fiction of truth,  
recognize the limits of understanding  

for in the breathtaking doorway —  
Piltdown to one bronze coin —  
it has been fables shared and acted on,  
eluding logic but for the single constant:  

agreement  
that harnesses the space walk,  
‘uncouples launching pads.

Magical, magical connection.  
I cannot touch this with words.  
Know that I am loving you by the sounds we have loosed together.  

Opening, opening so easy.  

I am timing my pulse to the rhythms  

‘Your eyes, and lips, and fingertips set throughout me,  

‘Throbbing with your loving like a lifebeat,  

Whirling with your chaos like the dancing woman I know within me.  
Linda Wittenberg  

‘The dark woman waited the most part  
of this day for the rains to stop.  

Soon after, she was walking in the sun  
up the green hillside.  

At the top of this rise, the scene she so  
often sees through her bedroom window,  
this tender lady rests.  

Her mind high, so at ease with the cool breeze,  
she walks among the plant life and talks  
with the female animals.  

Here her fantasy begins:  
I am with my most recent lover,  

the sun warm on our backs, we are  
silhouetted against the sky.  

On the highest peak of this greenness we embrace —  
‘The naked softness of our bodies brings back  
a sensation in us both...  

I have missed you these past weeks.  
I have missed your embrace —  
your naked softness.

(Once I was an amazon; my skin as brown as  
the earth, my eyes filled with stars, my heart —  
with the light of the moon as my mind traveled  
on rainbows, I could fly.  

My friends were there and my mothers of a different  
time smiled on me and gave me strength to  
continue to fly.  

and the moon was there as she always has,  
going through her cycles and showing herself  
full and round as we bled in praise and  
celebration,

For Ann, My Sister  

We lifted the domed  

lids of the two black  

trunks to see that vaudeville  

of crumbling satins, of laces  
sending up an ecru dust,  

papery silks and patent slippers  
flaking at the touch.  

Underneath a crush of crimson  
lay a tangle of necklaces —  
emerald, sapphire and pearl —  
with a heavy golden sceptre  

and diadems carved in half-moons  
as if from a single diamond:  

all paste.  

But they caught the sun at the window  
and sent their radiance back  

into the deep and shadowed room  
where we were kneeling.  

‘There we spent our long  
and humid hours in a parade  

of pirouettes, all posture  

up and down before the glass  

‘as we shaped the rising passions  
of the only heat our bodies knew  
while the August days melted  
down to night.  

‘Summers pass us by much faster now,  
a brief warmth for yet another year.  
We see each other now and then  
cover the tousle of our children’s  
heads thrust close together  
in their play.  
We listen to their voices  
spin the heat of make-believe  
into fairy tale  
like the ropes of rubies  
we braided through  
the blackness of your hair.

Etching  

‘The children pick their knives into the pulp-  

white fungus kicked from trees  

scratching serrated edges awkwardly  

drilling holes, cutting grooves deeply  

into the creamy edge, discussing Robanic Stooges  

then gone, bored  

they head out of the field toward the car  

out of the wind, the sound of drafts scoring  

the softer places in woods,  

the cold blowing, cutting the side of my cheek  

then back, they return  

with candy coffins found in the glove compartment  

chew noisily discussing the modeled candy forms  

of bat, mummy, skeleton, snake.  

‘They share one with me, which I masticate loudly  

letting the sweet juice flow on my tongue.  

Around us a half-dozen tree spores  

darken where they've been scratched.  

Blinded by sun we rest in the field  

mechanically moving the wheels of our language.  

Arching around us, the pale sky's unmarred.

Seen  

By the Greyhound station  
he spun off the curb carrying the child  
under his arm like a bunch of sticks:  
and when the buses revved their engines  
he started running  
The yellow ringlets flying  
much too much for man.  
and she, a little Kettlehead  
tucked into a red snow suit  
watched sideways,  
her blue eyes excited at the turn.  
He ran in his big boots  
head moving left to right, checking  
the traffic.  
‘The asphalt street became a forest.  
and I saw him steal that girl  
for his dinner.

Comfort  
and the gnawing thrashing search for relief —  

Screams of awkwardness, imperfections,  
I’m inside out and trying so hard to hide it —  
Aah, the “protection” of a smooth, silky veil.  

‘Tumbling in weightless cylinders between our eyes  
Darkness in small spaces between our heads and necks  
and the bright light on your glasses  

“The fit of my lips into soft depressions  

I can’t hear your whispers while you stroke my ear.  

Days later, seemingly unconnected  
our fear grows angered, hard, impenetrable, tight.  
If I felt strong I have lost it  
now I am fighting with all the venom,  
the enemy taught me how —  
But we stopped it,  
saw it,  
named it,  
retched it up  
We hold it delicately  
No need to throw it away,  
cover it up,  
hide it,  
bury it,  
It is ours,  
Born of a need that will die.

‘This separation has been so painful.  
I am full of large gaping wounds  
Where pieces of my flesh had adhered to you,  
‘And been pulled away, clinging.  

‘The wounds heal slowly.  

My anger builds unhealthy scar tissue,  

In vulnerable skin that wants to forget  

The feel of your fingers on my hips, and face,  
‘The feel of your eyes behind mine  

Loving, touching, drawing my insides out.  

‘You have been away and back.  
My scars had formed a thin veil  

‘Your eyes, once touching mine, have pierced.  
Tory when you touch me, and when you don’t  
And thinking that you may still  

This is not the separation of my fathers.  
Long for glimpses of another way,  

And tremble with the knowledge that  

I, you, we, together and separately  

Are birthing fantasies and future visions.  

Hard labor. Our tears mingling make a new baptism.  

I trust my blood to this pain.  
I bless your strength which rises still above our anger.  
I bless the women midwives, as frightened and as strong,  
Bearing our separation.

Mexican Landscape  

Gentle mother mountains surround me  
swelling with the fullness of fertile earth —  
wicca willows permeate the land everywhere,  
witchcraft spoken in every country.

Division and Remainder  

The large maple closest to the house  
Has long etched its odd twig patterns  

On the brittle-cold panes of our bedroom window.  
Now the tree expert insists it must come down.  

His voice drones on about its rot,  

Its threat to the house in a high wind,  
‘And his wide gestures spread the blame  
‘Over years of road salt, exhaust fumes  
Plus the tree's great age  

Soon that maple lies about the grass  
In a jumbled giant puzzle  

While chain saws swarm over its parts  
Like huge black ants  

Dismembering a golden butterfly.  

We stand around and watch  
Until the tree becomes  
What we can load,  
Carry and stack,  
Then measure by cords,  
Our only way of coping  
With the diminished  
Design of things.

Birthday  
I was in labor all night  
and the next day with  
my first child ready  
I thought for anything (which  
is the way I prefer to think  
before waves crest up and get  
snarlish) but all I remember  
through those twenty-three hours  
besides the functional facts  
between superior clinches and contractions  
of fetal monitors and periodic checks  
by the medical student in charge  
because my doctor was driving  
up from the Cape and the way  
people milled in and out  
of the room like guests at a disappointing  
banquet (Indeed, I felt the  
festival air and held forth once or twice  
with a bawdy phrase, a try at  
Bacchanalian jabber, and only once  
heaved a frustrated wretch, dry, into  
a silver plate and after that was given only  
a lemony swab to suck) All  
I can remember  
as on a strained postcard  
thin over the Charles and reverting  
to an extraterrestrial peace  
pink over Boston from my saddle-safe table  
under white sheets like a confused customer awake  
and asleep while dilation arrested and  
someone suggested Drugs — ‘No drugs!’ I  
commanded — and pitocin began to drip,  
then I swerved into gyrating intervals.  
more physical than climbing Big Moose  
and my husband stood there  
waiting as if he expected a newspaper  
to be delivered and  
an anesthesiologist came to hypnotize me  
back into “Breathe, press, relax” —  
was this one thing:  
I remember after we moved to the other room,  
where mirrors and lights bounced with  
skin flashes of thigh, belly  
how seriously gay it felt to  
touch bottom of the Life Mass  
I never understood till the moment  
you flooded Earth into the proper room,  
cheering, yes, and even  
in the squall got out and up in my arms,  
your Dad touched speechless except  
for the absurdly beautiful remark  
I think I heard him make —  
(Something) how really cool —  
(Something, something) and I, as I say,  
touching bottom, touched,  
and alive!

To Eve... because she looked for knowledge  
Herstorian,  
In what sacred book will the secrets we find  
of powers unlearned, buried  
that will turn this all around so quick  
that even I will see the change while I live.  
This urgency, this vision of the ways a culture could be  
is burning me inside.  
Thrust from what I know and what I do not know.

For Rose, reflecting on a picture of my mother ~ her wedding day  
A polished banister,  
a strong supporting newel post.  

You float slowly, pausing long enough to preserve this day,  
preserve its import.  

Five years longer have I paraded  
my smiling framed face,  
my draped strong, supple likeness of you,  
through all those similar wishes and disappointments.  

I am lost, mother.  
In desperation, I would call out to you  
Across miles, I could hear your strength.  

‘Your voice has grown weaker now  
static, crossed lines, interruptions.  
I hear another conversation, a different language.  

You've drifted far away from that stair now.  
Your skin is not so taut.  
‘There is nothing to give a hint of ease in your face.  

I want to cradle you in my arms  
and rock you to a rhythm that will heal our tiredness.  
Draw strength from the both of us  
‘That could never come in our isolation.  

Run quickly from that stair now, mother.  
Walk surefootedly, out that door.  
Vicki Smith  

Beaver  

squat  
and hunkered to the banks  

where cat tails comb wind  

the lapping water missed  

curled ears (curled! curled!) sharp;  
even underwater, provisioned  

with paws becoming webbed, tail  
beating out the slap-dash messages  
and teeth of course  

sinking beyond pitch to woo  

into what wood craftsmen carve  

their birds from — dams:  

not for flight up but under  

(into the silent chambers  

of their cold weather business). Beavers  
clucking like busy nannies  

through the stickish halls  

tending young while rivers groan  
around the stubborn shed  

and quick to beat out the leaks,  

to keep the root-stash dry  

(Gry as driftwood parching in the sun)  
unless a member dies, even then  
laying the goner up  

and walling him off completely  

to preserve the Dutch clean toughness.
