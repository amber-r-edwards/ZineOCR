Support  
Needed  

Members of the women’s  
community met recently in  
support of a rape victim who has  
come to us asking for emotional,  
financial and legal support.  

The woman, who is the  
mother of a 2-month-old child,  
was allegedly attacked in her  
home about 1 month ago by a  
known rapist in southern  
Vermont. The alleged attacker  
sexually assaulted the woman  
after shooting her common-law  
husband, paralyzing him for life.  

The woman and her child are  
now in Burlington, staying with  
a friend, while her husband is  
being treated at the Medical  
Center. The friend she has been  
staying with is leaving  
Burlington for approximately 6  
weeks. The woman and her child  
have a place to stay, but are in  
need of emotional, financial and  
legal support. A system of  
support has been set up by local  
women to make sure the rape  
victim doesn’t have to be alone  
at night when she is afraid, isn’t  
the only one to care for her 2  
month-old baby, and has the  
financial means to get the legal  
advice she needs. Any woman  
who can help this woman should  
contact BEAR at 863-4815,  
where the support network is  
being coordinated.

had to cover up their lovers’  
identity in this way for years. It  
is no improvement if I now feel  
the need to do the same  
(although for different reasons).  

The myths we entertain about  
each other lead us into limiting  

and traditional types of behavior  
and interaction. We begin to  
accept the myths without  
question and to believe the  

stereotypes others make of us.  
By sharing these stereotypes in  
open and honest ways, we can  
unite in a struggle to break  
them.  
UNCOMFORTABLE  
REALITIES  

As I said before, my

them a different  
from that of their more  
comfortable and lofty editors  
and publishers. Thus a reporter’s  
viewpoint may have more in  
common with the opinions of  
most of the paper's readers. The  
public may sense that the news  
it is reading has been filtered  
through the expensive but  
myopic lens of a certain class  
perspective.  

The public’s widespread  
suspicion of the press may be  
rooted in its feeling that  
“objectivity” is a hoax, and that  
many important issues are not  
being covered. Such a system  
can only lead to increasing  
public cynicism, or to wrong  
remedies, such as California’s  
Proposition 13.  

A public that is ill-served by  
the press will make a farce of  
democracy. I. F. Stone wrote,  
“The press is free — so long as  
you own one.” So long as this  
remains true, freedom will also  
be denied to the readers of the  
press.  

perspective  

insecurities about being accepted  
into the feminist community are  
caused by more than an active  
imagination. I have encountered  
a very elitist and cliquish  
attitude among some groups of  
lesbian women. I have felt  
obliged to prove my worth in  
order to be acknowledged as a  
potential ally.  

Although I personally don’t  
always like it, I can accept the  
preference of lesbians to party  
and socialize without the  
company of straight women. I  
am primarily interested in  
joining forces with them  
concerning feminist political  
issues and struggles. This  
becomes difficult, though,  
because so often social and  
“business” agendas are  
combined. If I’m present for the  

work part I may feel out of  
place for the social part.  
Likewise, if I'm excluded from  
the social events I may miss  
informal business discussions  

and agreements.  

One of the things that makes  
me feel uncomfortable during  
social events with lesbians is the  
frequent put-down of men. Not  
just specific men in regards to  
specific acts, but all men just for  
being male. Since I am involved  
with men I feel guilt by  
association. I perceive the hint  
that I must be stupid, blind and  
caught in old traps to be  
involved with men. I resent these  
insinuations. My heterosexuality  
is not a symbol of my ignorance  
or inability to think things out  
and make considered decisions.  
It is a choice I’ve consciously  
made — not just a result of  
brainwashing or programming. I  
don’t think this is the only  
“correct” choice, nor would I  
force it onto other people. I'm  
glad that we have a range of sex  
role models to choose from.  
Once we have made that choice  
from our free will, it should be  
respected.  

These are some examples of  
the sentiments I've experienced  
that cause me to feel alienated  
from the lesbian community. I  
admit that I have been too  
sensitive and uncertain about my  
interactions with lesbians. But  
I'm unwilling to accept all the  
responsibility for the distance  
that frequently exists.  
LEARNING FROM  
LESBIANS  

On the other hand, I have  
great admiration and respect for  

cont.  

lesbian-feminists. I can learn a  
lot from them about personal  
power, struggle and growth. My  
contacts with lesbians have  
shown me how much we have to  
offer each other as women. We  
don't need to depend on men  
for our emotional, physical,  
intellectual or spiritual support.  
It is reassuring to interact with  
women in loving, trusting,  
encouraging ways rather than in  
the suspicious and jealous ways  
that we are taught by society. It  
is wonderful to approach women  
as potential allies and friends  
recognizing our common bonds  
and histories.  

Contact with lesbian women  
reminds me of the importance  
and seriousness of women’s  
issues. Since their lives and  
concerns revolve around women  
they are more likely to be aware  
of the oppression and inequality  
experienced by all women. This  
is a good reminder for me.  
CONCLUSION  

In the course of thinking and  
talking about this article with  
other women I have been  
reassured about the possibility  
of a united feminist community.  
I have heard lesbians say that  
they want to share “women’s  
energy” with straight women as  
well as with each other. I've  
discovered many other primarily  
heterosexual women with  
feminist concerns who are hiding  
because of their confusion about  
dealing with lesbians. I don't  
think our differences are  
insurmountable so long as we  
address them directly. This  
seems necessary in order to  
avoid misunderstandings and  
defensive retorts. It is important  
to join forces within the lesbian  
and straight feminist  
communities in order to increase  
the energy and resources  
available to all of us.  

Writing this article has helped  
me to sort through many  
complex feelings. I am more  
centered and self-assured  
because of this. My energy is  
renewed, and allows me to face  
the more specific tasks and  
issues with strength and  
confidence. It provides me with  
a starting focus from which I can  
branch out and explore the  
issues more thoroughly. I invite  
interested readers to share their  
responses and comments to this  
article. I am also anxious to  
discuss this personally with  
other women.  

Criminal Code  

rape in federal jurisdictions,  
including all military bases.  
Spousal immunity is extended to  
any man living with the victim  
“as husband.”  

Section 1642 provides  
complete spousal immunity for  
sexual assault, which includes  
compelling another person to  
engage in sexual acts by  
threatening her or placing her in  
fear. Meaning of spouse includes  
non-married couples living  
together and married couples  
living separately without judicial  
decree of separation.  

Section 1646 obscures the  
reform to eliminate testimony of  
a rape victim's prior or  
subsequent sexual behavior. It  
states that such evidence is not  
admissible “except as otherwise  
required by the Constitution,” a  
vague statement which could  
open a floodgate of appeals of  
rape convictions.  

Sections 1722-23 make it  

illegal to threaten to damage or  
to damage the property of any  
business by strike action. The  
term property is broadened to  
include potential profits or  
economic solvency.  

Section 1861 gives any federal  
employee the right to forbid  
people from picketing, parading,  
or demonstrating before federal  
buildings “when risk is deemed  
possible.”  

Section 6035 revives an old  
obscenity provision which makes  
it a felony to mail any materials,  
printed or written, which  
“directly or indirectly” give  
information about procuring  
abortion. This statute defines  
abortion information as “every  
written or printed card, letter,  
circular, book, pamphlet,  
advertisement or notice,” and  
could be applied to any  
notification concerning a health  
care facility where abortions are  
performed.  

Protection Clause and a drastic  
limiting of the state and federal

Although several Vermonters  
remained in Washington to  
lobby our Congresspeople  
Stafford, Jeffords, and Leahy,  
most had to return home for  
work the next day. Exhausted,  
sunburnt, and dehydrated, the  

Vermont delegation climbed  

aboard their bus to begin the 13  
hour ride back, exhilarated by  

what had been accomplished  
that day. The women on the bus  
had a sense of energy and power,  
and a feeling of urgency about  
making plans to tackle the  
problems ahead. Using the bus  
microphone, Valerie Eckart, one  
of the organizers of the ERA bus  
and President of Central  
Vermont NOW, talked about  
fundraising to cover the costs of  
the ERA trip. Vermont NOW  
had gone $1000 into debt to  
make the bus trip possible, and  
some funds were still needed to  
help NOW break even. Ms.  
Eckart also talked about the  
importance of working together  
to build a network of feminists  
across the state. Carol Davis,  
co-coordinator of the Vermont  
ERA Strike Force, talked about  

plans to raise money for the  
ERA, and actions supporting the  

ERA that would be held in  
Vermont. Barnee Escott,  
Vermont NOW state  

coordinator, talked about other  
issues of importance to feminists  
in Vermont, mentioning the  
upcoming fight in the state  
legislature concerning protecting  
the right to choose whether or  

not to have an abortion, and the  
struggle to pass a newly revised  
divorce bill. The importance of  
writing to Vermont  
Congresspeople concerning the  
newly revised U.S. Criminal  
Code was also discussed, with  
Ms. Escott pointing out its  
anti-woman sections. Another  
concern in Vermont is the  
introduction of a call for a  
Constitutional Convention as an  
anti-right to choose ploy, and  
strategies concerning this issue  
were discussed.  

The bus reached Vermont at  
7:30 a.m. on Monday morning,  
and as each group of passengers  
got off at Brattleboro, White  
River Junction and Montpelier,  
promising to keep in touch, all  
the women on board sensed that  
after this demonstration, their  
lives could never really be quite  
the same again.
