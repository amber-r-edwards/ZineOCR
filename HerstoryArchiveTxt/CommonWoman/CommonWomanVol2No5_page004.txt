Can Men Be Feminists?

By Dean Brittingham
(Reprinted from
Women’s Write.)

To answer this question, we
first need to define a feminist.
My definition will make my
position clear.

A feminist is a WOMYN
who has recognized her internal
and external oppression, is ex-
ploring it, and looking for ways
and means of support from
other womyn to change her
position. Juliet Mitchell in
Women’s Estate refers to this as
the “politics of experience.”

A feminist not only recog-
nizes her own oppression, but
also that of all other womyn and
does not deny or defend her
right and obligation to invest in
the struggle for womyn’s rights.

In my definition, it is,
therefore, impossible for a man
to call himself a feminist.

The feminist movement is
an independent movement that
arose out of womyn’s dissatis-
faction and discontent with male
supremacy. The movement of
the 1960s also grew out of
womyn’s dissatisfaction with the
so-called “New Left” politics —
and men — those who identified
themselves as liberals or radicals.
Womyn involved in the move-
ments of that time often found
out that these supposedly en-
lightened men were, in fact, not
very different from other men.
We found our entry into politics
often meant the same as our
entry into the ordinary world of
work. We were expected to be
involved in political campaigns
organized by and for the benefit
of males. We were to act as
stamp and envelope lickers,
hostesses, receptionists, and bed-
mates. This was not liberating
politics — except that it helped
womyn to experience and see
their continued oppression and
the need to organize with other
womyn.

The feminist movement is a
movement unto itself. As wom-
yn, we recognize the oppression
of others. But until a womyn
confronts her own oppression,
the oppression of other womyn will
remain foreign to her. Together
we help each other learn and
experience what is unique to
our own situations, and what we
have in common.

We are not a humanist
movement. Without the recogni-
tion of our own oppression and
without solidarity, we will not
become humanists — if that is
even what we desire. It is up to
womyn to affect our own lives.
We should not be appealed to
for unity, or be guilt-tripped
into believing we must provide
unity for all. We are an organiza-
tion of womyn seeing our
struggles and making our own
life decisions and changes, and
helping other womyn to do the
same.

The question for me then, is
not equality of the sexes, but
the absence of it and the exami-
nation of it. We cannot look at
ways to achieve equality unless
we acknowledge that it now
doesn't exist. I for one do not
strive for equality with men.
What they have done is not what
I want to model myself after.
They kid themselves thinking we
will follow their example! We
have to recognize and admit that
a major issue confronting the
movement is the power struggle
between womyn and men. As
Kate Millet says “..we are
revolting against a deliberate
social policy of oppression.” We
can't pretend this doesn’t exist.
Wishing does not always make it
so.

Overall, males have opp-
ressed womyn. Perhaps indivi-
dual men have not. However, the
mere fact that they are males
gives them power we don’t have
— the chance to choose whether
or not to exercise power. Wom-
yn, on the other hand, are
continually fighting for their
right and power to make this
choice.

Our common oppression as
womyn binds us together. Indivi-
dual men can see this and be
supportive, but in the final
analysis, they are not womyn
and not subject to the oppres-
sion. They cannot experience
the discrimination and oppres-
sion that womyn feel; therefore,
they cannot call themselves
feminists.

Those men who claim they
are feminists, in my view, are
even more oppressive to womyn
than men who have no sympa-
thy for the movement. These
men are telling us that they
share our experiences and feel-
ings, even though they are not
womyn, and they deny our
needs and rights to organize
separately around specific issues
affecting womyn. This line of
thought implies to me that
without men in our ranks as
bona fide “feminists,” we as an
all womyn’s movement don't
have legitimate issues to organize
around. Only their presence
legitimizes us. They seem to say
that without men in our ranks
we will not achieve our needs
and goals because we will not be
taken seriously, that there is
no unity, and that we are being
divisive, not them!

In my view, men who
consider themselves open mind-
ed and supportive of womyn
would realize womyn’s needs
and rights to organize on their
own and would not feel threat-
ened. I contend that it is precise-
ly the so-called “feminist men”
who will cause disunity — will
cause womyn to fight womyn
over this and other issues,
knowing this is a sore spot for
many womyn who want “their”
men involved. This tactic is
continually used against us, even
when organizing womyn’s cen-
ters where men are allowed in on
a limited basis only.

I, however, understand men
wanting to be involved in the
feminist movement. It is the
most important revolutionary
movement in this and other
countries — the one that will
affect each and every one of us
in many ways. I myself wouldn't
want to be left out of such a
vital movement. But we have to
look at why men want to be
involved. Perhaps they want to
protect themselves and their
roles by maintaining the status
quo. Or perhaps they want some
input in re-determining their
roles. Is there any better way to
do this than to join the move-
ment that will have the power to
bring about changes? Or do they
want to divide it so no changes
will be possible?

I have no objection to men
organizing to raise their own
consciousness, to discuss their
feelings, their fears and their
joys. But I do not want womyn
to serve as their nurturers. Men
too have to learn to be indepen-
dent in practice, not just theory.

My question then is not
“Can Men be Feminists?” but
why do feminists have to con-
tinually justify our separation?
Even this discussion could be
seen as oppressive, in that we
have to address this — that we
have to make men an issue in the
feminist movement when there
is so much work to be done for
womyn directly. Must our wom-
yn energies be diverted to debate
issues over men? Will we make
advances in this way?

Other questions I have that
I would like people to think
about are:

(1) Would whites presume
to call themselves blacks because
they are in sympathy with the
oppression of blacks?

(2) How many hetero-
sexuals would publicly define
themselves as lesbians or homo-
sexuals because they sympathize
with these oppressed people?

(3) Does today’s topic
imply that womyn’s issues are
not important to stand alone?
And should feminists take these
topics seriously or see them as
diversionary tactics?
