difficulty... I am letting go,
separating from Rose, some days
with ease and some days with
deep strain... I have been so
bodily connected with her these
days... yesterday I felt I came
out from under a heavy weight,
a panicky, obsessed refusal to
relax... yesterday Rose regained
the movement of her arms, legs
and her speech... yesterday, I
drew from Abby’s and Gana’s
and Aura’s strengths and wisdom

and breathed a restful sigh... two
days before Rose’s stroke I felt
one side of my body surging
with energy... I lost the peri-
pheral vision in my left eye... I
forgot how to make lemonade or
walk to the beach... dreamed
Rose and I experienced a danger-
ous earthquake together... in
that dream I watched her face
quiver with the earth's tremors...
I have talked with most of my
friends, women and some men at
work, anyone who will talk
about death and mother-
daughter relationships.

I am leaving for Florida this
weekend... Once I made the
decision to go to Florida, I felt
empowered... I need to go there
for myself... This feels like such
an interruption in my life...
Yesterday afternoon I sat in a
local hospital waiting room,
trying to familiarize myself with
the surroundings, to have one
less shock in Florida... A young

woman doctor talked with me about cancer, radiation,
strokes... She said, “You will
never be prepared for all of what
Florida will be for you.” I want
to bring Rose more hope for her
struggle... I want to bring her
wombmoon energy... My uterus
beat hard, visibly hard all this
week, mother pangs, letting go,
birthing, dying... Dawn told me

that Rose could shield her
healthy cells from the radiation,
use it to kill only the cancerous
cells... she needs self-love, self-
trust... Rose can be feisty...
Rose has been my friend... I will
be alone in Florida without my
wimmin lesbian friends... Rose
can be my support, my friend...

Yet she is Mother... Another
woman... The visit to Florida
will be for two days... I will

leave there for Michigan and the
Festival.

Death is deeply ritualized...
There are so many “shoulds”
felt by the survivors of a death...
especially a Mother's death...
There can seep in heavy guilt for
the choices of how to experience
a death... I am feeling often
conflicted, very needy, vulnerable,
self-doubting and self-
affirming... With an overall view
I am living and experiencing this
process to my limits... I feel
powerful and alive because of
my choices... I shun all numb-
ness, throw it away... Rose’s
living and dying will not be
stolen from me by anyone, even
myself... my own life, vital
energies are heightened because
of this process... Rose, my
Mother, is living and dying — her
life is her life, her death will be
hers.

I am living on... understand-
ing the process of living clearer
now because I have reclaimed
my aloneness.

is a new and special feeling for
me as a mother! She won’t fall
apart if I say, “No.” And I don’t
have to, just because I’m her
Mother. I don’t feel trapped by
her needs; I’m not a victim of
Motherhood. We're two womyn
working side-by-side, trying to
meet our own needs. What a
good feeling! We've escaped the
patriarchy’s unending battle of
opposites: yes vs. no, depen-
dence vs. independence, work vs.
play, want vs. should, Mother vs.
Daughter. We're not in society's
roles that make enemies of
Mothers and Daughters.

Yes, enemies. My mother
and I are still enemies, caught in
a relationship overshadowed by
Guilt and Anger. And yet at the
same time Mother is the first
provider of our physical, emo-
tional and sensual needs — our
first love — and a very powerful
womyn to us all, still. What a
loss — separated from our first
and longest lover by society's
rules, patriarchy’s traps. And if
we are alienated from our own
mother’s love, is it no wonder
we are also alienated from the
love of our sisters, all the trap-
ped womyn, let alone the love of
ourselves. We are caught in

Patriarchy’s traps that keep
mothers separated from daugh-

ters, womyn separated from
womyn, womyn separated from
ourselves.

For me, beginning to see
beyond the traps of patriarchy
has come as part of my lesbian
feminist politically spiritual life-
style, that I share with my sisters
and my daughter. I want to be a
strong role model for my daugh-
ter. I don’t want to get caught in
the passive traps and battles
of Motherhood. But to not get
caught I need to have both
physical and emotional distance

from men, I go through this
process.

And when my daughter is
being responsible for herself
(isn’t treating me like Mother),
then it’s no longer MY FAULT
if it doesn’t work out right, or
MY RESPONSIBILITY to fix it.
She doesn't whine at me to
make it better for her. I feel like
I have the space to choose, to
decide what I want to do. (This

Diving

Is For Women

Surprised? Many women enjoy scuba
diving. In fact, 20% of the divers certi-
fied by the National Association of
Underwater Instructors are female. Many
women are active NAUI Instructors also.

Photography, feeding fish, shell collect-
ing, spearfishing and underwater sight-
seeing are parts of the scuba adventure.

Visit our facility to sign up for scuba
lessons. We believe women make great

divers.

unlearn the roles the patriarchy
has programmed us for. In the
Burlington womyn’s community
I get to enjoy some of the
distance that I need, since other
womyn have been forming their
own relationships with my
daughter that don't involve me.
These womyn help me to see

that how my daughter behaves
and feels in her own relation-
ships is not a reflection of, or
on, me. My daughter gets to be
her own person, without her
Mother looming in the back-
ground, holder of ultimate
Approval or Disapproval. And
while she is having her own
relationships I can have mine,
without the ultimate Responsi-
bility and Guilt of Motherhood
looming in my background.

And yet much of the time
we are together, still, it is not by
choice. I often be there for her
because no one else is, not
because I want to. Then I feel
trapped — and GUILTY — and
ANGRY — and we fight. I don’t
often get to choose to be with
her because I want to. (It’s
only once a year that she goes to
her father for two solid weeks.) 
I need more physical distance —
perhaps to live separately — to
further separate our Mother-and-
Daughter unit into 2 separate,
strong Selves. And yet, that
much separateness scares me. 
I don’t want to look at it much,
even though I know that it is an
option for me within this
womyn's community. There is
still too much unexamined
Motherhood in me. I’m frighten-
ed to look beyond it. (Will I
want to be with her when I
don’t have to?) And still I know
that with the support of this
community someday soon I will.
(Perhaps even more frightening
to me: do I have the courage to
send this to my mother?)

I've chosen to remain
anonymous to protect my legal
custody of my daughter. It is
not for my lesbianism that I
need to hide — he has already
sued me for custody using that
information. Rather it is the

nature of the relationship that I
seek with my daughter: the
political aspects of my lesbian
lifestyle, which I now need to
hide.

This officer got flustered.
The dykes were still shirtless but
not speechless. Insubordinate
infielders, outrageous outfield-
ers, rebellious women, unbound

I thought about how I'd stood
there naked and furious in front
of these boys and basically felt
in control of the situation.
They were scared by our anger.
Vulnerability around nakedness
had disappeared in my righteous
anger. I thought those boys and
that cop have not come up
against women like that before
and Burlington has not seen the
likes of us or the last of us.
