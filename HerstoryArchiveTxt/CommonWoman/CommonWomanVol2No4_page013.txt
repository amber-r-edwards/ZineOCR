REVIEW IN NEWS

Reviewed by Robin Getter

Rainbow Suite was an excel-
lent performance. I attended the
Friday night show and was
impressed at how serious and
together the Ketch Dancers
were. My eyes were intensely
focused on the stage, soaking up
the visual images, experiencing
the emotional transformations.

“Rainbow Suite is a dance
and art work based on a study of
the properties of light.” Each
section of the piece was a take
off of a different aspect of light:
rainbows, refractions, wave
lengths, prisms, etc. The dancers
moved in and out of these ideas,
adding life and movement to
them. The Suite included sincer-
ity, seriousness, humor and
suspense — a true work of art.

The Suite opens with just
lights and music. The lighting
reminded me of the old Joshua
Light Show at the Fillmore East
— LSD type merging of colors
and bubbles and sounds. It
wasn't as effective however in
the Essex Educational Center
with only a taped version of
sound. Oh well. The dancers
soon appear wearing brilliantly
colored leotards. They come on
in a slow motion walk, a very
pleasing introduction to the
dancers themselves and to the
concept of the movements of
color and light.

The second piece was called
Photons, defined as “a quantum
(bundle, surge or pulse) of light
energy." The dancers really
expressed this theme energeti-
cally. The best part was seeing
the green people jump onto the
stage from above. It was a
creative use of space and surprise
tactic.

Each segment of the Suite
had its own individuality. Each
piece moved me in a different
way. The Infrared and Infrared
vs Ultra Violet were really
dramatic — deep red lights, arms
and legs moving in a group
across large boxes, red and
purple costumes, people inter-
acting with each other, very
involving.

A pause occurs and when
the stage lights come up, pairs of
women in long gowns are seen
standing perched on pillar type
structures. They are curling and
twisting around one another,
sometimes with a quick pelvis
touch and a throw. This segment
is called Duet of Wave Lengths.
Soon Nancy Watkin and Marjor-
ie McMahon come on, and we
experience 2 people doing the
exact same movements but in
different ways.
Nancy is being angular, linear
while Marj is being soft, graceful
and flowing. I enjoyed the duet
a lot.

The next segment, called
Absence of Light, was great. The
pillars are used again only this
time we just see black figures
silhouetted against dark colors.
At first they are separate enti-
ties, moving in their own indivi-
dual way to the music of George
Crumb. Then you realize that
they are now dancing together —
a unit. Some brighter lights
come up and all you see is black
figures again, but with hands and
faces exposed. This was my
favorite section because Nancy
did so much with so little. I was
very affected by the subtleties in
movement and lighting.

Intermission was next and
we all feasted on some home-
made cookies and other goodies.
The bake sale was to actually
help cover the cost of the
performance. The Ketch Dance
Company has no outside funding
and depends on things like bake
sales, auctions and demonstra-
tions to keep them financially
afloat. It’s quite amazing that
they were able to put forth such
a complete show on such a
limited budget. Don Miller de-
serves a hand of applause for
helping them all the way.

The next 2 pieces were jazz,
disco and flash. Somehow they
did not seem to fit in (and
everyone knows how much I
really like jazz!) The first was
entitled Ultra Violet Heat. It was
a sexy, superstar trip by Nancy
which is something she seems to
fall back on a lot. It seemed
unnecessary and out of place.
The second, called Prism, did at
least put forth the feeling of
light traveling through space. It
was funny and light, but hardly
memorable.

After a slight pause we’re
brought back to the genuine
feeling of the rainbow. It was a
solo by Nancy called An Observer.
When I saw her dance this
piece, I wondered why she
bothers playing around with
disco! In this, she was dressed in
a skin-tight grey bodysuit and
she danced before a rainbow of
streaked colors shining on the
backdrop. She expanded the
lines, she played with the idea of
lines of colors, she filled the
stage with her moves. It was
really sensitive and well done.
Nancy eventually goes off by
climbing up colored steps
straight into the rainbow itself.

Finally the rainbow in full
appears. All the dancers come on
in their colors and dance in a
circle. We get a sense of com-
pleteness, a sense that life is
wonderful, fulfilling and whole.
(If you can possibly imagine it!)
Eventually the colors separate
out and move to a formation on
the steps. The piece ends as we
watch the living rainbow reach
up to the sky.

I have recently been able to
emerge from within a dark,
warm, protective shell to ano-
ther world. This Other World
starts with myself and extends to
the Lesbian Feminist Com-
munity. As a part of this Com-
munity in Burlington, while at
the same time being my own
center, I am surrounded by us
all. Within this encircling safe-
ness I feel free to think and
write and share.

One tentacle of my web
extends gynaesthetically to
Mary Daly, a Revolting Hag and
author of Gyn/Ecology. Her
encompassing book has become
a part of my Otherworld web of
encircling safeness.

My process of reopening to
my Gyn/Ecology — the Lesbian
Feminist Community in Burling-
ton — brings me to want to share
some thoughts that are emerging
to me on my Journey into
time/space in my mind.

What I want to share came
out in my mind while sitting in
Montpelier on the State House
lawn — in the lap of the patriar-
chy — reading, of course,

By Carol Wertheimer

Gyn/Ecology. Mary Daly
speaks, in her ever-so-carefully
selected and created words, of
the Independent Sparking of
Female Friendship — the fire
and the fury, the gynergy with
which we Spark each other to
become Independent Selves who
travel freely within our own
Network of Female Friendship. I
envision this process of Sparking
Female Friendship as a Spiral —
widening, soaring, reaching far
out, and always moving freely
within our Gyn/Ecological
time/space.

In contrast to the Spiral
image of Female Friendship, I
picture the pendulum-swing
image of patriarchal bonding/
bondage. The pendulum image
brings to my mind swinging back
and forth continually on the
same curve (a curve being one
part of a circle or spiral), hitting
up against a limit on each swing
and rebounding to the other
extreme, only to reach it and
rebound again. This pendular
process loses a finite amount
of energy on each collision, so
that the pendulum eventually

Ode to Gyn/Ecology

comes to rest at its balance,
which is a state of no motion,
stillness, death.

The image of the pendulum
swing is a popular one on the
patriarchal death trip. They talk
of political swings to the right or
left; they talk of white backlash;
they talk of the balance of the
scales of justice. What they don’t
talk about, but what us Revolt-
ing Hags (Lesbian Feminists
on our Independent Spiraling
Journeys) see is that the patriar-
chy’s justice is blindfolded! With
our Fury and Rage we must
burn off the blinding fold of
Justice. We Journeyers must
en/courage our Selves and
Friends to take a blinding leap
beyond, leaving the institutions
of patriarchy and the “femin-
ine” male-identified woman’s
role that bonds us to the patriar-
chy.

And let’s not overlook that
this bond to the patriarchy is far
from “mutual loyalty.” Who
tied the original blindfold on
Our Lady of Justice? Not you or
I! But it is you and I that can
and must dis/cover Justice —
reach our Vision of Justice, and
leave their folded patriarchal
death trip behind.

Seeing through the lie of the
pendulum swing — a patriarchal
model of change that keeps
women in a folded, dependent
state and leads us only to
energy-draining collisions and
ultimately death — is one way
Gyn/Ecology has Sparked me to
come out of a dark fold and into
the Light and Fire and Gynergy
that is the Lesbian Feminist
Community of Free, Independent,
Spiraling Journeyers.
