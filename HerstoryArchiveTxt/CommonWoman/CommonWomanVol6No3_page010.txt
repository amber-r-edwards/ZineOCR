POETRY

Mother /

hey woman yes I’m talking to you

don’t you know?

even the sun sinks into your skin
leaves only a little shine
on the cheekbones

heating the room from inside your breast
solid as a 1910 Glenwood black-iron range

your voice comes up from the center
of all our lives melody and harmony
making new tunes out of old blues

living as we do at the edge of the ice
the knife-like northern cold is a huge fact

you soak up the winter chill

your friends stay close stay warm

don’t you know your strength?
as large as Africa
you velvet night with no moon

—Nora Kerr

Excitement dribbling off

The underbelly of child’s illusion

Personal Power: Uses and ABUSES a wivccs

I thought of writing this
article for a long time, several
months in fact. I thought
I would outline some ideas on the
uses and abuses of personal
power. And I come to questions
more than answers.

When this community had
talks on class, I chose not to go.
I didn’t take part because my
focus was on healing myself at
that time. I’m glad I didn’t join
the discussions because frag-
ments and references that
I heard from the class talks
indicated an ugliness, an anger, a
causticness that I didn’t want to
be part of. There were some
valid points raised, that space
should be allowed in meetings
for women to talk who don't
usually talk, that privileged
women should be aware of less
privileged women’s needs.
Beyond that, I also saw (or at
least thought I saw from my
distance) women tearing other
women apart where the issue
was not class privilege but
influence and power or per-
ceived influence and power. It
sometimes seemed that women
who had put themselves on the
line doing political work and
building support networks were
shot down as being “middle-
class,” “privileged,” or otherwise
invalid.

One thing I want to say

loud and clear is that our politics

as women cannot be defined by
class and race. They are real
issues and affect us, but our

basic priorities cannot be shaped
by the realities of race and class
division. Or as Audre Lorde said,
“The master’s tools will never
dismantle the master’s house.”
In case we haven't noticed,
women getting together as
women-separate-from-men is
always suspect in this culture.

And why in hell do middle-
class women feel they have to
speak for working class women?
We can speak for ourselves and
often do, at the risk of being
misunderstood and/or put down.
If I am too timid or insecure to
speak for myself, you do me a
disservice. I will never learn or
have a hard time learning to
speak for myself if someone is
always speaking for me. I have
fully as much personal power as
any middle-class woman; what
we lack (unless educationally
privileged or self-taught) is the
confidence to express ourselves.
And middle-class women can’t
give that confidence to us; we
need to develop it on our own.
What middle-class women can do
is make space for us to talk in
their meetings. For the women’s
Movement of today is diverse.
We need to use our differences
to empower ourselves, not tear
each other apart.

Be aware that working class
women may have survival skills
from youth that middle-class
women painfully develop at a
later date. Again we all have
differences, individual ones that
don’t fit into any pre-conceived

mold, but I would like to make a

few generalized observations. As
a working class woman, I feel
that I am more in touch with my
feelings. Middle-class women
often feel too headbound, too
word-bound to me. I sometimes
think meetings are too lengthy
and too centered on how do we
feel about this rather than what
we can do about this. Also,
working class women may not
be as inhibited as middle-class
women by the habit of being
nice, being polite and trying to

take care of everyone. When
survival is a daily issue, you
don't have time for trivia and
this may seem to middle-class
women like a denial of good
manners or an abrasiveness.
Sometimes I get this line of,
‘Why don’t you like me?” when
I'm saying “I don’t like this
thing (whatever it is) that you
do.” When I share my anger, it
means I trust the other woman
enough to tell her about it
instead of shutting down my
feelings or turning away from

The main thing that I try to
keep in my view is whether or
not what I do makes connec-
tions of our differences or does
it divide us and put us into
boxes? I don’t so often hear
what people say, as watch what
they do. Some people tell pretty
tales about what should be but
never try to realize those ideas
or visions. I wish it to be other-

not tear each other down,
