Women and the Legislative Treadmill

By Pamela J. Greene

The current legislative ses-
sion could be an important one
for Vermont women. Women
here are still, to a large extent,
“invisible citizens” with needs
and problems that need to be
addressed by new laws.

This year, as is often the case,
women’s rights advocates will be
working to defeat particularly
offensive, anti-women
legislation. Unfortunately, this
leaves little time or energy for
any bills that deal positively
with women’s issues. This cycle
tends to keep essential rights
looking like progress and
progress looking like an
impossible dream.

In March, 1978, women from
across the country testified at
the Rural American Women's
Conference about the positive
images and negative realities that
make up the rural woman's
lifestyle. Vermont women have
always been full participants in
the daily hardships and
responsibilities of rural life. But
they remain stereotyped as
non-productive, second-class
citizens. As taxpaying
Vermonters who make up 51.3%
of the population, women have
the right to full representation,
including the right to earmark
funds for their needs and
interests.

Right-to-life has promised two
bills, both sponsored by Senator
Mandigo, that will attempt to
restrict abortion rights. One will
specifically seek to end the use
of public money to fund
abortions and the other will call
for a Constitutional convention
to include an anti-abortion
amendment to the U.S.
Constitution. Both of these
restrictive pieces of legislation
are expected to be strongly
opposed by a coalition of civil
rights and women’s rights
groups.

Last year, Senator Mandigo’s
anti-funding, anti-abortion bill
was narrowly defeated in the last
weeks of the session. Currently,
there is conflicting evidence
about how poor women are
obtaining abortions in Vermont.
The year before the funding
restrictions, 180 applications for
assistance were received. The
next year, only four were filed,
but the total number of patients
seeking abortions did not
decline.

It is clear that some providers
are temporarily absorbing the
costs, instead of turning away
patients who are dependent on
their government for health care,
but who are being denied a legal
medical procedure. To correct
this injustice, there may be a
pro-funding bill introduced to
insure that poor women retain
the right to choose if and when
they will bear children.

Another bill that is being
proposed by a statewide
coalition of women’s groups is a
state Equal Rights Amendment.

Vermont ratified the federal
amendment in 1973, and
defeated a subsequent attempt
to rescind it. The text of the
Equal Rights Amendment is as
follows:

“Equality of rights under the
law shall not be denied or
abridged by the United States or
by any State on account of sex.”

At the present time, it is
unclear if the time extension
recently granted the ERA will be
sufficient to allow three more
states to ratify, so individual
states are being urged to amend
their own constitutions to
protect equal rights for both
women and men. Representatives Louise
Swainbank and Susan Webb are
expected to reintroduce a
revised support and custody bill
that failed to pass during several
previous sessions. It is a very
involved bill and there has been
some controversy surrounding it.
Child support would be
expected from either or both
parents, and custody would be
awarded only after consideration
of many complex factors. This
bill would require a social
rehabilitation report for every
contested custody case, in hopes
that the child's interests would
be protected. It is felt that this
bill would allow men rights
when seeking custody of their
children.

Senator Bloomer may again
introduce a family court bill.
This legislation would create a
separate judicial system for all
matters involving the family,
such as divorce, support and
adoption proceedings. This
would expedite court cases so
that a woman and her children
would not be left for prolonged
periods without support, while
waiting for an initial hearing.
The judges would be experts in
family law, and so would be
familiar with the special
problems involved. However,
there has been controversy
about its impact on women and
it is not clear if it could be
considered a “pro-women” bill.

Legislation dealing with
displaced homemakers has been
increasing around the country in
recent years. State funds were
appropriated in Oregon,
Maryland and California for
centers with "re-entry
programs” for homemakers
displaced by death, divorce or
desertion. These women have a
wealth of life experiences that
need to be translated into
marketable skills. In Vermont,
there are no training facilities for
displaced homemakers, but these
women often qualify for CETA
positions.

At the present time, the gay
rights climate can be called
stable in Vermont. There is a
traditional tolerance for
difference that is maintained as
long as cultural norms are not
insulted in a highly visible
manner. There has been no
restrictive legislation proposed
concerning sexual preference,
but full civil rights for
homosexuals have not yet been
addressed.

Abuse and neglect of the
elderly is a special concern for
women, as they now make up
the majority of older citizens. A
recent New York conference on
aging noted that while men are
in no way immune to the
penalties of age, women are
punished more harshly.

For the majority of women,
to be old is to be poor. In
Vermont, isolation and lack of
adequate housing further
complicate the lives of older
women.

Battered women throughout
the state are in desperate need of
shelters. The Women’s House of
Transition in Burlington is
currently the only shelter for
victims of domestic violence,
and is full to overflowing.
Domestic violence remains a
hidden epidemic throughout
Vermont, with no alternatives
for most of its victims.

A resolution is needed from
the legislature to curb abuses of
citizens’ rights when separation
of church and state is not
maintained. An example is the
recent trend in parochial schools
to alter the Pledge of Allegiance
to include anti-abortion
language. In Vermont, a heavily
Catholic state, some powerful
state legislators have allowed
their religion to dictate their
decision making.

Freedom of religion does not
mean imposing those beliefs on
others.

Other women’s issues that
have been addressed in other
state legislatures include
provisions for day care,
compensation for rape victims,
and inclusion of information
about sex equity in education
(Title 9) in teacher certification
programs. None of these topics
is expected to be considered in
the upcoming Vermont
legislative session.

The Governor has already
outlined his preliminary budget
proposal, with a 6% increase in
total spending that will only
cover fixed expenses and not
increased benefits to social
programs.

With this budget a fiscal
reality, Vermont women must
insure that their representatives
redistribute funding so that
women’s needs are met without
increased state spending. Women
and children remain the least
powerful segment of society.
When the economy falters, they
are the first to feel the pinch
from cutbacks.

Vermont women are relatively
isolated and unorganized,
without the time or money to
involve themselves directly in
the legislative process. In
addition, there are many
well-financed special interest
groups competing for funds and
supportive legislation. It will
take public education and a
grassroots effort to counter the
lobbying of these special
interests.

Equality is not cheap, but the
alternative is continued social
injustice for women. Vermonters
may be self-defined
conservatives, but they retain a
longstanding commitment to
individual liberty, independence
and justice. It should be this
spirit that guides the 1979
Legislature as it goes about the
business of making laws that
reflect the dignity and worth of
all Vermonters.
