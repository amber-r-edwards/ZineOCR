By Julia Alvarez  
My sisters and I have had to  
work very hard to tack silver  

as newspaper stands, a variety  
of bookcases and a stereo stand;  
and she has completed larger  

view of the world. Along with  

everyone else, I believe in all the  

projects such as room additions.  
bad things that can happen, but  

I have always believed that my  
grandmother would be capable  

perhaps, having been raised on  

holocaust, I’ve swung towards  

of building a home from the  
ground up. In fact, it has been a  
happiness as an adult. I’m not  
blind to the Falklands or Poland  

grandmother. It still gives me  
warm feelings when I remember  
the many evenings working in  
her workshop basement, aware  
of how knowledgeable she is;  
aware of her abundant patience;  
aware of her own self-esteem.  

I might add that my own  
mother has shown talent in the  
line of carpentry and as I was  
growing up, it was not unusual  
to see mother and grandmother  
working on projects such as  
paneling or renovating a bath-  
room or building a room addi-  
tion or converting an attic into a  
bedroom!  

Although I don’t see my  
grandmother often, she is very  
supportive of my carpentry

“I long to speak out the  
intense inspiration that comes to  
me from the lives of strong  
women.”  

—Anthropologist Ruth  
Benedict (1887-1948),  

quoted by Margaret  
Mead, MS, June, 1982  

My grandmother, Irene, is a  
strong woman. Since dedicating  
myself to a professional career  
and its corollary frequent geo-  
graphical relocations, I seldom  
see her, but for me, my grand-  
mother’s inspiration is omni-  
present within.  

There are a lot of interesting  
things about my grandmother,  

or South Africa, but my sense of  
balance remembers the peaceful  
elections in the Dominican  
Republic. This May, the last  
recorded case of typhoid almost  
two years ago, the march for a  
halt to nuclear weapons at the  
United Nations thousands  
strong. I am not an optimist by  
nature or upbringing. In fact, if  
shown a Rorschach of a mush-  
room and asked what it is, I will  
guess, “Fallout.” Still, because  
I’ve got my mother’s voice on  

personal secret desire to build a  
home with my grandmother.  
Even though that seems less  
likely to happen, it feels good to  
know it might have been if...  

In the near future, I am  
enthusiastically looking forward  
to a visit home and working on a  
small project, still undecided,  

CELEBRATING OUR BODIES  

CLEAN ENVIRONMENT  

the other end of the phone  
predicting that the sky will fall, I  
tend to look out the window  
and, silly girl, make a wish on a  
star. My wish, “Dear God, don’t  
let the sky fall.”  

According to my mother,  
I was a child of darkness. All the  
major events of my life had an  
uncanny way of coinciding with  
natural, national and international  
disasters. Even before I  
was born, tragedy was in my  
background. My parents married  
the day a fine dust rained like  
confetti on Hiroshima. I was  
born during a total eclipse of the  
sun. The list goes on and on, and  
at each family reunion—my  
mother darkens my biography.  

“You broke that,” my  
mother says, nodding at the  
crooked swerve of my right  

forearm, never perfectly healed,  
“the same morning Trujillo  
was assassinated."  

“Don't you remember,” she  
says, “you got your first dog,  
the one that bit you, the day  
those Russians launched Sput-  
nik? That’s why you named him  
Sput.”  

I don't remember. I have  
blanked out on one or the other,  
either the dog or the satellite,  
the broken arm or the dandy  
dictator riddled with bullets. It’s  
as if my mind, in storing the  
memory, severed a secret con-  
nection between my life and the  
life of the world which, if I took  
seriously, would prevent me  
from ever acting, afraid that my  
decision to take a job or go on a  
trip might bring on a kidnapping,  
a stock market crash, a  
torpedo moving swiftly in the  
waters of the South Atlantic.  

For a while as I was growing  
up, my mother says, she thought  
I had an important destiny to  
fulfill in the history of the  
world, “I thought it was a sign,  
you know, that you were so in  
sync with the great movements  
of your time. I told your father:  
‘Eddie, that girl is going to be  
something important. Maybe an  
Eleanor Roosevelt, maybe a  
Joan of Arc...” My mother casts  
a disapproving glance at my  
shabby jeans and sensible, home-  
made sweater. We page through  
the family album together.  

Under each snapshot of me in  
my first communion dress or  
blowing out ten candles or  
holding up my spelling bee  
trophy, a caption is written out  
in my mother’s hand: “June 5,  
1967: Julia’s graduation; Arab-  
Israeli 6-day war starts.”  

“Then I thought you were  
one of those bad luck people.  
I'm sorry, okay, but it’s the  

truth, ‘She’s born under a bad  

star, Eddie,’ I told your father.”  

“Thanks a lot, Mom.” We  
are sitting, reminiscing in the  
den. It is Sunday afternoon. I've  
driven down six hours to spend  
Easter with my folks, and I’m no  
longer glad I came.  

“Am I blaming you? My  
mother snaps at me. “Am I  
blaming her, Eddie?” She  

glances over at my father who is  
fast asleep in his armchair.  
An open copy of The Guns of  
August has fallen against his  
stomach as if he were keeping  
some information he had read  
there to himself.  

“Technically, Mother,” I  
defend myself, “every day there  
is a major disaster somewhere in  
the world, so anything that ever  
happens personally could be  
hooked up with some catastro-  
phe somewhere...” I think of  
those birthday cards you can get  
that show the news headlines for  
any day and year of birth. I  
think of those mock headlines  
you can have printed up as a  
practical joke: MOTHER  
BLAMES DAUGHTER FOR  
HIROSHIMA. “We're all respon-  
sible, if it comes to that,” I add,  
“for the good and bad that  
happens in the world.”  

My mother glances up from  
a snapshot of me looking very  
Mephistophelian in a black gown  
and unraveling a scroll in front  
of an ivied wall. “Julia earns  
Masters diploma,” the caption  
reads. “May 16, 1978, coup in  
Santo Domingo.” She claps the  
red vinyl covers close and gives  
me that sweet mother smile she  
reserves for newborns, brides  

and Hallmark cards received on  

time for Mother’s Day. “You're  
absolutely right!” she beams. “I  
wish more people had your  
attitude. Someone stole the lids  
from my garbage cans, did I tell  
you? And then everyone won-  
ders why the Northern Irish  
can’t get along...”  

My mother has always taken  
my theories to such absurd  

lengths, they seem parodies of  

what I believe in. Worse, she  
ascribes the exaggerated versions  
to my genius. “Julia says... Julia  
thinks...” I'm the smart one with  
the Masters, so whenever my  
name is invoked in my family of  

endeavors and we discuss ideas  
and suggestions over the phone.  
She is always pleased to know  
that she might be able to contri-  
bute toward reducing my tool  
deficiencies! To this day and a  
young age of 76, Gram still does  
carpentry; she, herself, has a  
remarkable workshop in her  
home. Over the years, she has  
built small items such as wind-  

Spanish aunts? hardworking cou-  
sins and sisters, it has the same  
effect as the mention of E.F.  
Hutton in the commercial.  
“Julia says...," and the conversa-  
tion stops.  

On Mother's Day, my three  
sisters and I surprise my mother  
with a visit. We have all brought  
gifts, and after dinner, my  
mother unwraps them, cries a  

little after each one, and declares  
that she’s been a lucky mother,  
in spite of all the terrible things  
in the world, to have had four  
good daughters. My gift this year  
is The Book of Days. “Oh,” my  
mother marvels, sniffing, “Look  
at that!” She shows off the book  
to the room. “What is it?” she  
asks me confidentially.  

I turn the pages of the book  
as it rests on her lap. We arrive at  
her birthday, and listed there are  
all the major events that have  
happened on that date since  
recorded time. “Ancient festival  
of Cybele celebrated in Rome.  
Mariner VII launched towards  
Mars.” Some events are not so  
major: “First coast to coast  
color T.V. broadcast.” My mother  
notices that half or more of the  
events are crossed out.  

“Hey,” she says. “They sold  
you a defective copy. Look, it’s  
all marked up!” She shows me  
the black magic marker blots as  
she riffles through the pages of  
the book.  

“I did that,” I tell her. “I  
crossed out all the tragedies. I  
want you to concentrate on the  

good things, okay? No more  
catastrophes, disasters, floods,  
revolutions...”  

“Julia thinks we're respon-  

sible for all the fighting in  
Northern Ireland,” my mother  
announces to my sisters.  

“That's not exactly what I  
said, Mother.” I shake my head,  
frustrated. “You've got to have a  
more positive outlook!” I look  
at my sisters for support. They  
all nod. I pour wine into my cup  
and hold it up to her. “Mother,  
what is it?”  

“It's a wine cup,” she says,  
scowling, “and you're drinking  
too much!"  

I ignore her scolding. “Tell  
me, how full is it?”  

“It's half empty.”  

“Oh, Mother! That proves  
my point, don’t you see? You  
could just as well say it’s half  
full.”  

She looks at me suspiciously  
as if I were trying to put one  
over on her. “Same difference,”  
she says, “You're still drinking  
too much.”  

I hold the cup up and toast  
her, “To Mother,” I say and,  
defiantly, gulp the wine down  
until the cup is indeed empty,  
but ready to be filled again. “To  
joy, to generosity, to peace!”  

My sisters laugh. They lift  
their glasses. We are four strong  
against the atom bomb, the  
Falklands, Poland, Afghanistan.  
We mean to plant a thousand  
flowers on the dusty hillsides of  
my mother’s Mount St. Helens.
