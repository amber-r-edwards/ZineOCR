A review of Stephanie Pappas’ music during  

open mike at Hunt's  

Frets  
for Stephanie  

a black snake slides  
over the turtle’s back  

night On the Mississippi  
river flows black & slippery.  
lovely water drawing song.  

moonlight meanders in tidal ripples  

on satin swales.  

tan flats caught miles away  
from bluer waves on either side.  
the river knows the blues  

I marvel yours were so close  
how could I know or expect  

to feel that prairie moon here? stroking  
riparian frenzy where woods and mountains  
replace that shimmering grassy disk

By Linda Comito  

The Rhode Island Feminist  
Theatre (RIFT) returned to  
Burlington on February 27th  
with their production One Is  
Silver. RIFT are women artists  
creating for an audience of  
women. Feminist art is finally  
becoming more widespread. Wit-  
ness women’s music, painting,  
small-press literature... Yes,  
women continue to produce  
mainstream art. But this is  
different. There is a clarity in  
this new art, a new sense of  
concentration.  

In all of our struggle to  
understand ourselves outside of  
a male-dominated culture, it is  
possible that there is a refuge in  
art that we are just beginning to  
realize. Art can be comforting  
and unifying, while being, at the  
same time, a ruthless tool for  
accurately defining our situation.  
Art is one way of asking a  
question over and over until the  
truth is revealed. As such, it’s an  
activity we need to use for  
ourselves.  

If one happens to have been  
saturated in this culture, this  
isn’t as easy as it sounds because  
it means:  

(1) ridding oneself of the  
learning related to and the  
expectations of mainstream cul-  
ture;  

(2) sitting with the itchiness  
to begin while searching for a  
new way;  

(3) having the courage to  
use what one wants to and reject  
the rest, in order to create what  
is personally useful: in order to  
create a woman’s clear voice.  

One Is Silver is a feminist  
play. The cast and production —  
all women. It speaks to women’s  
issues. Its structure is basically  
traditional. Yet, in a sense it is  
like a dance. The main character,  
Emma, goes in and out of scenes  
with one or more of her four  

I'm trying to feel as much again  

and you must understand I'm sick  
and tired of that other  

crap I heard tonight and  
I didn’t even tip the table and scream  
'cuz there’s a blue-uniformed bully  

in my head keeps me in line.  

your voice puts him drooling  

in the black & white and  
I can rant in color.  

I sweat a memory nearly panic  
until the heart in your smile reminds my  

of the truth what is real  
comes shining through  
our old pain new sorrows  

oh sweet woman those frets  

dissolved all mine tonight  

your fingers on the pulse  

women friends. The friends,  
between scenes, rearrange the  
very pleasing set which is com-  
posed of boxes of differing sizes.  
The play is skillfully balanced in  
tone and pace.  

The two main themes inter-  
twine, for they both have to do  
with stability and change.  
Emma, a college art teacher, is  
forty. She wants to quit her  
job and try to support herself  
with her painting. For most of  

possible poverty — the familiar/  
the unknown — the acceptable/  
the risk — the comfortable/the  
challenge.  

Emma’s moods and tortured  
questioning affect those who love  
her: new friends and old friends.  
The endurance of old friendships,  
the uneven beginnings of new ones — these  

qualities are realistically por-  
trayed. In the midst of her ever  
vitalizing friendships, Emma  
comes to a decision.  

The play also makes a quiet,  
and important point in its  
acceptance of each of the  
woman’s lives: a housewife, a  
working mother, a scientist, a  
student, and then Emma, who is  
a lesbian and an academic. These  
women support each other,  
quarrel with each other, respect  
each other.  

their  
(What  
Hollywood, advertisements, and  
other strange ideas of “people.”)  
The play creates what is  
common to women’s work for  
women: an intelligence that is  
stimulated and exercised by the  
challenge of creating something  
sense of warmth, an  
acceptance of the fragile nature  
of life, and an honest, uninhibited  
sense of humor.  
Most of what we have been  
taught, what surrounds us now,  
has nothing to do with femin-  
ism. One Is Silver is different. It  
is provocative...  

—turtle  

inspiring...  
wonderful... it is HOME.  

a  

tongue hammers a song in my center  
I’m home.  
and the river’s flowin’ again.

By the end of the play, the  
cast are like our friends. Their

Williams was spotted, Reason-  
able Doubt Number Four!  

The solitary fact that can-  
not be disputed and which  
overshadows all reasonable  
doubts is the knowledge that no  
killings have occurred since  
Williams was arrested.  

But what about the reason-  
able doubts? On Feb. 27, after  
12½ hours of deliberation, the  
jury came back with its verdict,  
“We the jury find the defendant  
Wayne Williams guilty on count  
number one and guilty on count  
number two." He was sentenced  
to two consecutive life terms  
and will be eligible for parole in  
seven years. An appeal is expect-  
ed.  

“I hold no malice against  
the jury, the prosecutors or the  
court,” Williams said. “I hope  
the person or persons who  
committed these crimes can be  
brought to justice. I did not do  
this.”  

So once again justice has  
been served; a killer has been  
apprehended and placed behind  
bars. But the nagging question  
does not stop...  

Is He The One?  

ANARCHA  

Continued from page 7  

if we are ever going to make  
a revolution happen, we are  
going to have to “demand the  
impossible.” We are going to  
have to live in alternative libera-  
tory ways as we undermine the  
old authoritarian ones. Viewing  
the world categorically is some-  
thing that this atomized society  
would have us do to keep us  
isolated, compartmentalized,  
divided. It enables the concept  
of ranking to not only exist, but  
to pervade our everyday thought  
and to keep us busy with sec-  
tarian theoretical infighting. We  
are going to have to learn to see  
things as interconnected and  
whole. Ynestra King offers a  
synthetical approach:  

“To fulfill its liberatory poten-  
tial, feminism needs to pose a  
rational reenchantment that  
brings together spiritual and  
material, being and knowing.  
This is the promise of ecological  
feminism... If we proceed dialec-  
tically... operating at both the  
structural and cultural levels, we  
will be neither materialists nor  
idealists. We will understand our  
position historically and attempt  
to realize the human future  
emerging in the feminist  
present... We can (then) move on  
to the inter-dependent issues of  
feminist social transformation  
and planetary survival.”  

This ecological feminism dialec-  
tic that Ynestra talks about is  
now I view anarchism. It gives us  
the free space to organize on  
many levels at once with a  
common goal in mind: the  
abolition of all hierarchy (and  
therefore all kinds of oppres-  
sions). Cherrie Moraga articu-  
lates this need for all women:  
“In this country, lesbianism is a  
poverty — as is being brown, as  
is being a woman... The danger  
lies in ranking the oppressions...  
The danger lies in attempting to  
deal with oppression purely  
from a theoretical base. Without  
an emotional, heartfelt grappling  
with the source of our own  

oppression, without naming the  

enemy within ourselves and  
outside of us, no authentic,  
non-hierarchical connection  
among oppressed groups can  
take place.”  

I am a woman oppressed by  
the patriarchy; I will fight  
sexism. I am a lesbian oppressed  
by homophobic people; I will  
fight heterosexism. I am a  
worker oppressed by my boss; I  
will fight bourgeois capitalism. I  
am a woman of color oppressed  
by whites; I will fight racism. I  
am (fill in who you are)  
oppressed by (fill in who you are  
oppressed by); I will fight (fill in  

your least favorite “-ism”).  
I am an anarchist oppressed  
by oppression; I will fight  

hierarchy... in all its varied and  
ugly forms.

reaction as quoted above.  
The reason  

graphic image of women?  

in anger, in insult, and in over-  

behind the  
desire to censor can probably be  
found in an estimation of the  
importance to our culture of the  
image of women in pornography.  
Susan Griffin speaks of the  
symbols of the dominant  
culture, language, ideas, images,  
and reminds us that witches  
were burned for destroying the  
religious symbols of that culture.  
Should we be surprised at the  
wrath we invoke when we speak  
against so fundamental an image  
of our culture as the porno-
