Who are the witches?

Where did they come from?

Maybe your great great
grandmother was one.

Witches are wise, wise women
they say.

There's a little witch in every
woman today.

Wicca was an early religion,
a re-linking with the life force of
nature, of the planet and of the
space and stars beyond. Witches
were Goddess worshippers working
with a tradition of the wise
and healing arts. They were
herbalists tending to illness and
health, and they were psychics
aware of the intricate workings
of the earth and her people.
Their wisdom brought life juice
to people. Wicca was not a series
of precepts and beliefs, but an
active way of experiencing the
power of love and joy, and of
awakening the power that comes
from within the self. Through
ritual, witches exchange and
purify energy, express joy and
love of the earth and her inhabitants,
and cast spells using
objects and symbols of the four
elements as tools to aid in the
accomplishment of specific
goals.

On Hallowmas, the witch’s
New Year, the goddess displays
her third aspect, the destroyer of
life. As the Sacred Hag, she
represents nature in winter; a
death which is organically important
for future life. On this
day, she returns to her sisters to
give wisdom of the ages, to
protect, to revenge. This is the
time of Hecate: she is of the
underworld. She represents both
destruction and renewal; she is
the goddess of the crossroads.

At Hallowmas the veil between
the psychic world and the
material world is its thinnest.
This is the time for witches,
wombin, amazons to envision a
New Year, a new life, a rebirth —
a transformation — we need a
transformation brew, to set
askew, to renew and re-do, to
come through the heavy cloud
of psychic pollution spewed
forth by the patriarchy; to push
through the silence, thick,
oppressive, choking the voices
and the spirits of wombin
throughout the ages. Emergency!
emergency! Now is the
time for us to gather together to
break through the silence...

NINE MILLION WITCHES
WERE BURNED in Europe
alone. Untold millions worldwide,
native Americans, Africans,
all earth-connected people share
a common bond of magic and
ritual with the witches. The
patriarchy tries unendingly to
deprive people of their knowledge,
their experience, their

ritual, communion, continuum,
their power. The patriarchy’s
main tactic is to instill fear to
silence our ancient wisdom, our
self-knowledge — through the
scarcity mentality. Witches
celebrate abundance. When we
come together, when wombin
circle together we feel the
abundance and the richness of
each other's lives, our wisdom,
our stories... Together we find
our voices, we break through the
sound barriers, chanting, drumming,
we break through the time
and space barriers, a time warp
through which we weave the
threads of our lives, our voices,
our songs. As we affirm our connections
with the earth and each
other, encircling each other with
our voices and our love, we generate
our own power, by
unblocking the source, the resources
inside ourselves, we release
the spring of being.
SOURCE, RE-SOURCE, SOURCERY,
SORCERY. The patriarchy
has taken all that is sacred
to wombin's souls and lives and
invalidated it. We have been
robbed of our essence, our
essential spirituality and sexuality.
They have taken our words
and negated them, they have
taken our images and twisted
them. The old hag, the wise
wombin, healer of the country
folk. Heathen pagan, these
words originally meant country
dwellers. The witch the patriarchy
would have the world see as
evil and destructive. The patriarchy
has dichotomized the world,
split her in half, good and evil,
black and white. They will
destroy the world if they continue
on their linear path. We
must reweave our circles, reclaim
our words, reverse the patriarchal
tide. Envision... circles of
wombin as clusters of stars
sending our healing messages and
strengthening energy, a network,
constellations. Envision... circles
of wombin, worldwide, circling,
spiraling, swirling, churning,
creating a commotion, a commotion,
waves of emotion, a
healing potion for the transformation
of a dying nation. We
need true re-creation. Our re-
creation is the celebration, the
affirmation of a wombin
notion.
The circle is our weapon.
The circle is our tool.
The circle is our heartspace.
The circle is our school.
The circle is our kiva.
The circle is our truth.
The circle is the power
against the ones who rule.
A witch is one who has power
over her own life.
One who makes her own rules.
One who refuses to submit to
self-denial.
One who recognizes no authority
with a greater esteem
than her own, who is more
loyal to self than to any
abstraction.
One who is untamed.
One who says “I am a witch”
aloud three times.
One who transforms energy.
One who can be passionate
about her ideals/values as
they are changing.
One who is explosive, whose
intensity is like volcanoes,
floods, wind, fire.
One who is disorderly, chaotic.
One who is ecstatic.
One who alters reality.
(from Womoonature Prod.)
I am a witch, a psychic
healer; I am a womon growing
strong. And with my sister
survivors, we sink our roots into
the soil of the earth — each
tiny tendril — of our root tips
extending, stretching to the core
seeking sustenance from our
mother. And in turn we grow
singly as trees, together as
forests, thick and lush reaching
for the sun and sky with majestic
fervor. I am a magical and
visionary womon working in
earth rites to reclaim the dusk,
dawn, day and night of this
round and revolving planet.
I am a womon, a revolutionary,
recalling the herstory of
true Womon’s reality.

Church St
of City Hall at 6 for
theectre speeches transformation brew.

Please bring two offerings
for our transformation brew.
One which represents something
in your own life that you would
like to have transformed — this
could be words on paper, an
object or image, and also something
that represents or gives
you strength. We will share these
things in our circle by going
around and having each wombin
speak about what she brought.

Meet at EWP at 4:30.
Procession up, then down,
gathering at steps.

Women were the gatherers
of food. They collected fruits,
vegetation, and seeds. They
planted their fields with seeds
which brought a steady supply
of food to their people allowing
more time to be spent within the
community to educate and cultivate.
Food was plentiful creating
a surplus of crops.

Dykes, witches, Amazons of the
Northeast S)

Some of us have been
wanting to build and enlarge our
web with other dykes. We want to
counsel with you/us on how to
rid ourselves of the patriarchy
and how to go about creating
spaces where we can live in
freedom. We want to gather with
other dykes to meet each other
and determine what goals and
processes we share and how we
can support each other's work
and lives.

We would like part of the ritual
on Hallowmas to be a visioning
of the world we want to inhabit
and a naming of that within us
and without us that is keeping us
from realizing our vision. Please
bring a few candles red, black
and/or white. Also bring something
which is a source or
symbol of strength for you. This
could be words, an object, an
image.

We would like to gather in
Plainfield, Vt. the last weekend
in Oct. Saturday could be spent
meeting and sharing who we are
and what our visions are. Satur-
day night there will be a wombin's
dance. Sunday we could
share ideas on how we will
create our visions and perhaps
make plans to work with each
other in implementing our ideas.
Sunday night we will celebrate
Hallowmas in theater, song,
dance and ritual. We will ask
Hecate to lend her energy to
ours in ridding ourselves of
oppression and creating wombin's
space.

Child care has not yet been
coordinated. Let us know if you
need it. We are not wheelchair
accessible but can perhaps construct
a ramp and carry wombin
to the second floor of the
community center which is the
space available for the dance.
There is as yet no interpretation
for non-hearing wombin. We will
look for someone who can do
that. Different wombin in the
community will be making space
available in their homes. Bring
sleeping bags, warm clothes,
food and your beautiful, strong,
creative, questioning, wombin-
loving selves. We can counsel,
circle, celebrate, create, dance
and strengthen our web of
resistance and love. Please inform
your wombin community of this
gathering and let us know
if you can come. It will be
wonderful if a wombin from
each community comes. For
