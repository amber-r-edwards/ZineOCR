Vibrators: A Short Circuit

Vurs is a culture in which

women have been
mythologically, systematically,
all-pervasively trained to be

alienated from our bodies and
from our sexuality. We have
been educated to expect sex as
romance or violence — in which
we will be passive, but respond,
in which our response will be
vaginal orgasm. (That is, a
mystical orgasm, occurring at
the same time as his, if possible,
resulting from normal, healthy
heterosexual intercourse.) We

or shall I say a stroke in the right
direction. However, where the
end of women learning their
own orgasm-ability is desirable,
the means (vibrators) are a by
product in design and
performance in the best
tradition of the culture which
has necessitated their use.

Vibrators are designed with
him in mind — and I don’t just
mean the shape. They are part of
the short-sighted, far-reaching
male market. I have used the term

“male” generically in this paper,

marketed these machines has
marketed our continued
alienation from ourselves; made
it palatable while shoving it
down our throats like
sugar-coated penises. The same
hand that has manufactured
these machines has raped and
beaten us. Technology is a
monster of the male imagination
— it creates waste and disease for
profit. When profit is the
measure of success and power,
progress will forever be a
manipulation of the wants and

have been called, and believed
ourselves to be, frigid when we
haven't responded sexually, and
Devil, Temptress when we have
(Devil — the consummate evil).

In this system, where we have
learned of only negative value in
masturbation, celibacy or
lesbianism (all relationships
without men), the vibrator as a
stimulant seems certainly a step,

i.e. to mean that which is
traditionally male, and not to
refer to specific men who may
be struggling to combat these
stereotypes! Technology which
wants to keep us turned on and
out of touch, which wants to
keep us manipulated and
mesmerized, which wants to
keep us within its mechanical
grip. The same mind that has

needs of the people. There is no
profit in self-help (i.e. giving the
knowledge of our bodies back to
us). It is upon our continued
alienation, our continued
poisoning that the medical
profession, the psychiatrists, the
vibrator-makers profit. This is
technology at its most
death-loving, causing a sickness
and then selling a product to

alleviate the symptoms.

We must examine and
re-examine what we have been
asked to accept in the name of
liberated sexuality. We don't
need shock therapy, we need
self-sensitivity training; and it
should be taught in schools to
children as basic health, not sold
later, over the counter, to
frustrated adults. We cannot
fight cultural, spiritual, sensual
deprivation by inventing
machines to titillate or clitorate.
Women have been in the vacuum
of male defined sexuality and
sexual response for too long. We
need to take the power back

into our own hands. We need to
learn lovemaking as a sharing of
our love for ourselves, with
another. We need to learn self
loving by beginning to touch
ourselves — explore our crevices,
our cleavages, our clitorises —
selfishly and unashamed — flesh
to flesh.
Self-loving,
revolutionary

selfishness is a
concept. It
threatens the very base of
patriarchy, the family, the
church, the state, who would
have us be selfless, serving. This
is all we have learned. It will be a
slow and difficult process to
unlearn this self-abnegation
which is so deeply rooted. The
joy in self-celebration that we
discover will most certainly
bypass the electric orgasms they
will have us accept as ecstasy.

Vaginal
Politics

Dr. James C. Burt of Dayton,

Ohio, has been literally
exhibiting his wife as
“demonstrable proof” of his

claim that his devised surgical
procedure of “reconstructing the
vagina to make the clitoris more
accessible to direct penile
stimulation enables a woman to
have more frequent and intense
orgasms.” Burt calls his new
product “the Mark II vagina;” it
is achieved by “relocating the
pre-existing vagina... by

constructing a significant
additional length of new
vagina... by lengthening (i.e.,
severing) the pubococcygeal
muscle...”

Dr. Diane S&S. Fordney,
associate professor of
gynecology at the State
University of N.Y. at Stony

Brook, was horrified by the
severing of the pubococcygeal
muscle, calling it “totally
anatomically inappropriate... it
opens up a significant risk of
urinary and rectal prolapse.” Moreover, she points out, Burt is
encouraging major surgery
without first recommending any
form of sex counseling and, “it
is a sexist, woman-reducing
process to suggest that women
should rearrange their anatomy
to meet a male-induced and
male-desired goal.” Needless to
say, no male physician is
suggesting surgery on the penis
to increase its contact with the
clitoris.

Abortion

Continued from page 1

denying federal payments for
abortions except where the life
of the mother was endangered.
This amendment, in various
forms, has been added to each
subsequent appropriations bill,
each time denying the use of
Medicaid funds for abortions.
On June 20, 1977, the U.S.
Supreme Court held that states
cannot be constitutionally
required to pay for abortions
which are not “medically
necessary.” The effect of all
these decisions is to guarantee
the right of reproductive
freedom to all women but to
limit its exercise to those who
can pay. In most states,
low-income women cannot get
Medicaid funds for abortions,
and must either bear a child,

unwillingly, or find a “cheaper”
solution — a self-induced or
medically unsafe “kitchen-table”
abortion! (In Vermont the
situation is somewhat better.
There is some funding for
abortions for low-income
women. Contact the Vermont
Women’s Health Center or
Planned Parenthood in
Burlington for details.)

Why are women’s rights to
reproductive freedom being
eroded? Who is trying to deny
women the right to control our
own bodies? These attacks are
being led by a group which calls
itself the “Right to Life”
movement. A better name for
them is the “Compulsory
Pregnancy” advocates, since
they are against both birth
control and abortion. Their
opposition to both methods of
controlling reproduction stems
from their religious and moral
belief that human life begins at
conception. Their ultimate goal
is the “Human Life
Amendment,” which would
amend the U.S. Constitution to
define a fetus as a person with
full constitutional rights. The
effect of this amendment,
among others, would be to make
birth control and abortions, even
to save the life of the mother,
illegal. This attempt to violate
our first amendment rights to
religious freedom by legislating a
particular religious viewpoint
into Constitutional law is backed
primarily by the Catholic
Church, which adopted this plan
of attack in 1975 at the National
Conference of Catholic Bishops.

Since that time, the anti-right to
choose strategists have focused
on two efforts: calling for a
Constitutional Convention
(under Article V of the
Constitution) which would draft
an anti-abortion amendment,
and getting Congress to pass the
“Human Rights Amendment” to
be ratified by 38 states. The
Constitutional Convention
process has never been used to
amend the Constitution, and it
may allow a general revision
(rather than a single
amendment) which could
endanger the civil liberties
guaranteed by the Bill of Rights.
Some strategists believe that
Congress will pass the “Human
Rights Amendment” to prevent
the Constitutional Convention
from being called.

Women must have the right to
control their reproductive lives,
through the use of safe birth
control measures and, if
necessary, safe and legal
abortion procedures. Without
the right to control our own
bodies, we cannot control our
own lives.
OUR RIGHT TO
REPRODUCTIVE FREEDOM

IS IN DANGER!
