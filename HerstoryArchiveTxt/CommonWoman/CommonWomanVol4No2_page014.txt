acutely aware of the man’s
edginess. She denies her own
anger and tries to control the
situation by smoothing over
little issues and protecting him
from things that may set him
off. He knows his behavior is
wrong and he fears she will leave
him. He is extremely jealous and
may accuse her of infidelity,
imagining relationships with his
friends. He uses these accusa-
tions to justify his anger. He
may threaten her family and
friends and she feels responsible
for his violence and tries to
control it. Tension rises.

In the “Explosion Stage,”
the man no longer understands
his anger. He becomes violent.
The woman can often retell this
stage in detail. He cannot. The
explosion may last from a few
hours to 24 hours to 45 hours.
He seems to know how to
prolong the battering without
killing her. We do not know why
he stops.

The “Love Stage” follows,
which is welcomed by both. He
is sorry and tries to make up. He
is charming and manipulative.
He believes he can control
himself in the future and pro-
mises never to hurt her again. He
convinces everyone. She has a
glimpse of “the man she loves”
and she wants to believe him. He
plays dependent — he will fall
apart without her — and she
ends up feeling responsible for
him as well as for her own

Dr. Walker's theories are
extremely helpful to people in
battering situations. They are
usually surprised to learn that
many people are experiencing
similar cycles of violence. Under-
standing the situations they are
caught in helps them to look
outside for solutions.

The myth that women in
battering situations have the
freedom to leave not only puts
the burden of solving the prob-
lem on the victim, but in most
cases is in total conflict with
their situation. Economic depen-
dency, low self-esteem, children,
and male threats of following
and hurting others who inter-
fere, together with the fact that
there is no long-term shelter for
battered women in Vermont,
make leaving a frightening and
difficult task. And as one victim
at the meeting pointed out,
when society does not acknow-
ledge the violence as unjust, or
blames the victim for not

controlling the aggressor’s rage,
the victim herself tends to
minimize the pain and accept
her fate.

The numbers and problems
of battered women are surprising
and it is important to think
about why, if woman-beating is
so common in our culture, we
do not hear more about it. As
Deane explained, traditionally,
societies have not only con-
doned the beating of women,
but have legitimized it. The
myths that men “own” their
wives and have the right to
“discipline” them have provided
the social immunities men who
cannot control their anger need
to commit this violence without
responsibility or guilt. As long as
these myths are accepted in
society, the illusion that woman-
beating is a male right will
continue. It is therefore essential

to the battered women’s move-

ment to retain a strong feminist
ideology in order to be effective
in dissolving those illusions.
Presently, as organizations and
shelters for battered women
become more socially involved
and institutionalized, the loss of

feminist ideals in the movement
is a threat. Terms like “Spouse
Abuse” have been introduced
which deny the very realities of
the violence they seem to define
— male violence against women.

Battered women need a safe
place to go where they may keep
their children with them. They
need constant support from
other battered women, indivi-
dual and group counseling, and
legal advice. Presently in Burling-
ton, Women Helping Battered
Women provides a 24-hour Hot-
line, short-term safe homes,
emotional support, advocacy
and referrals. WHBW is looking
for and will provide training for
volunteers who are interested in
working on the Hotline, provid-
ing safe homes, and helping in
other ways such as fundraising
and outreach. Interested people
may call the Hotline (658-1996)
for more information.

There are ways in which we
all can help. As Deane pointed
out, we must re-evaluate and
clearly define our feelings about
violence and the limits to which
we will accept violence in our
society. We must also learn more
about the realities of woman-
beating. We must make it part of
our daily consciousness and talk
about it. That is an important
way everyone can help — by
asking about it and talking about
it. Such communication will
provide the undercurrent neces-
sary to keep the battered
women’s movement moving

ahead.

Rent

decide whether the increase is
justified or not, based on, but
not limited to, the following
criteria:

1. Rent for comparable
apartments in different areas of
the city. 2. Amount of taxes and
overhead on the specific build-
ing. 3. Number of bathrooms,
bedrooms, and general sanitary
conditions. 4. And, most impor-
tant, does the building meet
minimum housing standards.
Each case that is presented to
the Commission will have the
same standards applied to it,
with no bias allowed.

The Fair Rent Commission
will operate on a budget genera-
ted by a small fee per unit that
landlords will pay each year. The
average fee would be $10 per
year or 84 cents a month. This
fee will be passed on to tenants.
However, PACT feels that this is
a small price to pay to avoid
unjustified skyrocketing rents.

PACT is calling for all
concerned tenants and fair-
minded individuals to become

involved in this issue. If you
have any questions, would like
to become a Burlington regis-
tered voter, or would like to
help in any way, contact PACT
