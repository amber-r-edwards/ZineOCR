Maf the Heart Wail and Prevail  
By Jesse Sunquiet

When I read Myra’s article  
about the “Emotional Care  
Space” at Michigan festival, and  
the article on Banning Shock,  
both in the same issue, it was  

obvious to me that it was about  
time that Commonwomon hear  
from the Liberation Movement  
Against Psychiatric Oppression  
that is alive and well in Ver-  
mont.

“Mentalism,” the oppres-  
sion of people of passion and  
emotion, who do not choose to  
conform to society, or find it  
impossible to do so, is an oppres-  
sion as important to recognize as  
sexism, racism and classism.

There was a time we can all  
remember when people laughed  
when we insisted that they use  
the word “woman” instead of  
“girl,” and now almost everyone  

is aware of sex-role oppression  
even though some of the subtle-  
ties still escape them. It is now  
important that we learn a new  

language — that of emotional-  
mental liberation. We can no  
longer use the word “crazy” so  
glibly and derogatorily. “Mental  
health,” you must understand, is  
a euphemism for a system of  
dehumanizing control; the “hos-  

pital” is a prison and the “men-  
tal patients” are psychiatrically  

Myra, oppressed herself, wrote  
about Carmen — “she was  
taken to a psychiatrist and she  
wasn’t even crazy,” as if there  

was a categorical difference  
between those who are crazy  
and those who are not. Carmen,  
like myself, has had the good  
fortune never to be caught,  
incarcerated and labeled by the  
mental health system. What if  
she had been labeled “crazy?”  

Should that make any difference  
in how we treat her? If she had  
been an X-inmate of a psychia-  
tric prison, all the more reason  
that she should not face that  
oppression again and be further  
traumatized — in the name of  
sisterhood!

And just to set the record  
straight, Carmen was not sent  
specifically to a psychiatrist, and  
there was no intention of  
helping her. She was sent direct-  
ly to a mental hospital to be  

incarcerated for her extravagant  
passionate behavior, to ensure  
the festival staff that she would  
no longer have the freedom to  
upset the “normal” women.

Thank goodness that the hospi-  
tal staff recognized that Carmen  
didn’t belong there, even though  
they didn’t realize that no one at  
all belonged there.

So what happened to Car-  
men? She found, within the  
group of other psychiatrically  
oppressed women, the life-force  
and genius that she had searched  
the world for. She wanted to  
come to Burlington because she  
had heard that the women were  
more wild and challenging there,  

but the reception was not good.

Wail and Prevail

“Why us?” asked one apprehen-  
sive Burlington woman, not  
wanting to be that wild or that  
challenged. And so she stayed  
with her passionate sisters and  
eventually came to stay with me  
in a little secluded house by a  

pond in Plainfield. It was not  
easy. I was not used to being the  
caretaker for the “angel of  

light.” While she and others were  
talking about magic, I was  
shoveling the firepit — Bah!  
Humbug! But the truth of it is  
that once I got through my  
resistance, I saw that Carmen  

was a great teacher of cosmic  
reality, a gift, one-in-a-million.  
“Live your emotions,” she said.  
My house became a vibrant  
gypsy camp where we lived our  
emotions and our principles as if  
we were in another culture.

This past year at Michigan  
Festival, we saw a difference  
with the new existence of the  
“Emotional Care Space,” as  
Myra described it. But does  
anyone realize that that center  
was there for all women because  

those of us who have suffered  
psychiatric abuse struggled for it  
post-fest and on through the  

year? We worked long and hard  
to set up a heart-felt home-like  
environment, only to find that,  
not only were we not getting  
paid, but paid-staff positions  
were given to professionals who  
were not part of the original  

organizing group and had not  
the same “Oppression.” Men oppress  
women because they fear our  
earth-centered power and pas-  

sion. Emotion Care had one of the  
smallest (if not THE smallest)  
budgets of any facility at the  
festival. And we constantly had  
to raise the consciousness of  
others to respect our work.

Now in Vermont we have a  
newly formed feminist group  
against psychiatric oppression,  
coming again out of an incredi-  
ble amount of unpaid labor and  
struggle with prejudice, not only  
in the larger society, but also  
within the women’s community.  
The women’s group also works  
in coalition with other Vermont  
X-inmate self-help groups, and  
together we form a Liberation  
Front that is one of the strong-  
est in the country. Rumor has  
it that many women of Every-  
woman’s Place hold the Libera-  
tion Organization responsible for  
the fiasco of a gang of street  
people crashing and trashing the  
unsupervised drop-in center on  
Main St. As I understand it,  
those folks were not related to  
the Liberation Organization at  
all and it took a while for the  
absentee organizers to clear up  
the destructive situation. In the  

meantime, it gave us all a bad  
name. Folks are quick to believe  
anything bad about a “bunch of  
crazies,” but we have to move  
beyond that prejudice. Certainly  
we are strong and worthy of some  
respect. It is true that there  
is sexism within the movement —  
but that is precisely why we  
formed the women’s group and  
are asking for your support.  
Some of the men are in men’s  
groups to deal with their sexism,  
and it was the women’s group  
that was given the largest por-  

tion of collective money granted  
by the state. All the groups are  
self-governed and the coalition  
makes decisions by consensus. In  
fact, I am continually amazed at  
how revolutionary the process is  

— not allowing the Mental  
Health Dept. to intimidate us or  
monitor us, maintaining an in-  

telligent political consciousness  
and being generously fair with  
each other.

It is ironic that our alterna-  
tive support groups are funded  
by the State Mental Health  
Dept., and that does present  

some problems. One of those  
problems is that we are given  
$30,000 to prove that we can do  
a job that really requires  
$3,000,000 to be effective. This  
means we work overtime for  
free, become tremendously frus-  
trated, and come to realize that  
our more radical political work  
is drastically undercut — almost  
as if this meager allowance was  
designed to do just that. Larger  
funds do exist within the state  
coffers and it behooves us to  
work toward getting more of  
that money plus foundation  
grants, instead of struggling with  
a false sense of scarcity — and  
that requires more support from  
the larger political community,  
i.e., YOU.

We must realize that there  

are some common concerns for  
women, third world races, Jews  

and we are taught to fear  
“crazies” for their ability to move  
beyond the logical and the  
controlled into a more free-flow-  
ing reality. It is the controlling  
society that must change — not  
the people. We must realize that  
those who are found to be un-  

acceptable and uncontrollable  
by society and are thus locked  
up in prisons called hospitals,  
controlled by drugs and shock  
called treatment, dehumanized  
and often debilitated for the rest  
of their lives, these people  

include geniuses, artists, shaman  
healers, psychic visionaries, and  
some of the most sensitive  

individuals in our society, who  
are being just as oppressed as  
women, blacks and Jews for the  
same reasons. We all represent  
what is the spirit and the body  
and the passion and the soul, all  
that is unfathomable in human  
nature that cannot rightly be  
controlled by the human mind  
and the will that seeks a predic-  
table sterile environment to be  
manipulated.

“Mental Health” is not a  
social service situation in which  
one group of caring people is  
trying to help another group of  
needy people — it is instead a  
political struggle of one group of  
mind-controlling people trying  
to hold down the energy of a  
group of mind-expansive people,  
and doing it in such a way as to  

make money and aggrandize  
power in the process, while the  
oppressed group is trying to  
break free. We are locked up,  
drugged, ghettoized, and stigma-  
tized precisely because we are  
essentially a revolutionary force.  
We face opposition from the  
Mental Health establishment, the  
American Psychiatric Associa-  
tion, and the drug companies,  
which together constitute a  
multi-billion dollar industry  
designed to perpetuate their own  
power, payment, and propagan-  
da. They are not likely to hear  
our complaints — not because  

they do not see the problems,  
the injustices, and the lies, but  
because they know intuitively  
that they stand to lose every-  
thing if they admit the truth.  
One psychiatrist was ostracized  
for his attempts to radicalize the  
APA. That same psychiatrist was  
known to respect one of his  
clients enough to not label him  
as sick but instead to check out  
his complicated mathematical  
theories with the best authorities  
to find that this distressed young  
man had just come up with a  
major mathematical breakthrough.  
Another psychiatrist  

would have called it a break-  
down and given him thorazine —  
he was lucky. It is also interest-  
ing to note that the radical  
psychiatrist had spent some time  
in the looney bin himself. No  
wonder he understood! Most of  
the professionals in the industry,  
however, would rather wear  
blinders and continue to debili-  
tate and destroy the lives of  
thousands rather than admit that  
they have been “wrong” and  
jeopardize their jobs, their fancy  
lifestyles, and their sense of  
power and self-importance.

In Vermont there is a new  
Commissioner of Mental Health  
and a surprising new openness to  
hearing our grievances. We hope  
to see a continual open line of  
communication with the com-  
mission, the establishment of an  
advisory board and perhaps  
some paid jobs for the work that  
we do all the time anyway. We  
have also been known to picket  
and blockade psychiatric estab-  
lishments, and I have fond  
memories of dressing up, getting  
into the APA convention, doing  
street theatre and giving  
speeches during the sessions.  
Whatever is appropriate at the  
time. We bend.

The Women’s group would  
like to introduce itself to you  
now — We are The Queen of  
Heart WAILS — Women’s  
Alternative to the Institutional  
Labeling Syndrome. The name  
came from the concept of the  
movie The King of Hearts, in  
which the doors of the mental  
institution are left open and the  
“crazies” came out and staged a  
marvelous playful reaffirmation  
of life in the midst of a war  
going on. We say we are the  
Queen of Heart singular, because  
we are not talking about indivi-  
duals reigning over the emotions  
of others but are a collective  
expression of the quality of  
Heart itself. Our expression  
takes the form of a WAIL — the  
witches calling for liberation.  
And we say that it is the Institu-  
tion labeling that is the sickness  
of syndrome, and not the people  
that it oppresses.

Right now Queen of Heart  
is located in Plainfield on a 25  
acre farm just outside of town.  
We are open to any woman that  
wants to join with us for mutual  
support. Since we are only a  

month old we are not really  

defined yet and new input will  
bring new definition. The farm is  

a meeting place, info center,  
short-term shelter and I see  
weekend workshops developing  
there. The future is open. We  
meet every Tuesday night, 7:30.  
You can write to us at RD 1,  
Box 1400, Plainfield, Vt.,  
05667, for more information.  
We need more community  
women involved at this point to  
give the organization a strong  
feminist base, and to build a  
broader state-wide support sys-  
tem for those women who are in  
need and cannot travel to the  
center. There needs to be a  
network of safe-houses or con-  
tacts in every community center  
much the same as is organized  
for battered women and rape  
victims. We also need help with  
continual consciousness raising.

I can remember time and  
time again when other women  
would either turn the other way  
when I was in pain or would give  
me a bad rep for my strange  
behavior. When I mentioned the  
project to a group of friends,  
one woman remarked, “Oh good,  
we can tell X about it next time  
she goes off the deep end” — as  
if there was a categorical differ-  
ence between her and her friend.  
The other women in the room  
laughed slightly. I gulped and  
went on being polite. But we  
must realize that there are no big  
differences between us. It is not  
the emotional woman who is the  
problem, but rather the emo-  
tion-fearing culture that must  
change. We can no longer punish  
those who refuse to hide their  
passion, refuse to be moderate,  
refuse to lie, and refuse societal  
standards of what is appropriate  
behavior. What does that mean  
to go off the deep end? Is it  
always best to enter life timidly  
by the shallow end?

I suggest a sequel to this  
article be an interview with  
different psychiatrically oppressed  
women. And perhaps we can  
set up a community-forum panel  
discussion in Burlington.
