OLD SURVIVOR  

LILLIAN WASHBURN  
RAPE SURVIVOR  

Her boyfriend raped her because he was  
drunk, and besides, they were already  
fooling around. Her husband raped her  
because that was his right/her duty.  
The shrink raped her because that’s  
what she needed. The trucker who  
picked her up raped her because she was  
asking for it. The cops she called raped  
her because who was she going to call  
to report them? The judge at the rape  
trial mind-fucked her and said what did  
she expect in clothes like that? Now she  
runs a rape crisis hotline.

RUTH POIRIER  
WELFARE SURVIVOR  

Survives looking for an apartment for  
4 months. Survives being told to get a  
job — and trying. No one will hire her.  
She’s just a housewife. Can’t get a job  
without a car; can’t get a car without a  
job. Survives being called a welfare bum  
when she daily busts her ass performing  
the miracle of having her kids and her  
survive on what welfare gives her. She  
does this without endangering herself  
or her kids, though she sure thinks about  
endangering some big shot at welfare...
