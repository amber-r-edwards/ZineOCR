RESISTANCE ANGER EMPOWERMENT FURY

Katherine Kohrmon “in contempt”

Katherine Kohrmon has not
filed a federal income tax return
since she began working. The
first year of her war tax resis-
tance she wrote the IRS a letter
saying that she did not want her
wages to support machines of
destruction. Katherine has been
to court twice now for her
refusal to pay for war. The first
time she was brought to court,
on Friday, May 28, she was
handed a court order to turn her
income records over to the IRS.
She didn’t. Katherine went to
court a second time on Thurs-
day, July 22 to show good
reason why she was not in
contempt of court when she
refused to provide her records.
The judge handed down a very
stiff sentence. She was found in
contempt of court and ordered
to turn over her records. Judge
Holden said that she will also be

fined 100 dollars every day from
August 2 through September 1
until she produces her income
tax information and pays the
300 dollar fine for court expen-
ses. Katherine is representing
herself through her trials. She
thinks that in a matter of
conscience one must speak for
themselves. In court she asked to
be tried under the Nuremberg
treaties, international law that
came out of the holocaust of
Nazi Germany, laws that super-
sede national laws. The judge
said that she was being tried for
contempt. She also asked to be
given her fifth amendment right
not to incriminate herself. The
judge said that she was being
tried for contempt. Justice is
blind truly, but justice couldn't
be deaf to the standing ovation
Katherine got from the court-
room after she read her state-
ment which says:

“As a Jew I have been
witness to the holocaust in
which 11 million human beings
perished, six million of them
Jews. I stand here still in the
shadow of that unimaginable
event.

And in that same era two
nuclear bombs were dropped
on Japan — another holocaust,
another shadow. Two weeks
from now, August 6 and 9,
mark that horrifying occasion.

One would think that the
world, and especially the
powerful nations of the world
would have learned from these

events. Learned to work
against racism, against nuclear
destruction. To work for peace
among peoples of the world.

But instead the government
of this country continues to
spend billions and billions of
dollars — dollars that are the
hard-earned income of people
in this country — on
increasingly horrifying nuclear
weapons of destruction.

We stand now at the brink
of an atomic holocaust, in
which, if it takes place, all the
human race will perish.

As a Jew who remembers,
and as a woman in a world
dominated by men and as a
responsible citizen of this
country and of the world I must
bear witness again, I take
this responsibility on myself in
the spirit of my Jewish up-
bringing — that each person’s
actions are important and
accountable. Always in search
of a higher truth, always
working for life and freedom.

* With this spirit I will not
cease in my efforts to bring
about the dismantling of all
atomic weapons in every
nation. I protest with all my
mind and all my strength
against the creation of new
atomic weapons. I can support
no government spending for
atom, or chemical or poison
gas weapons. I can support no
government spending for acts
of military aggression directed
against the poor and third
world countries.

And I will not rest until our
earth is rid of these threats to
the existence of life. I look
forward to the day I can pay
my federal taxes in good

Amazon War Tax Re- Sister

buzzing with a mixture of
hope, fear, excitement and over-
whelmment, we wound our way
through the green mountains to
Rutland... Ellen and I were the
only two from our dance gather-
ing that could attend the trial
of war tax resister Kathryn
Korman. (read her statement
and account of trial on p.14)
Before leaving Plainfield we had
gathered and practiced some
songs with sign language and an
ancient Indian prayer for peace
told with words and movements.
To me, movement and sound are
two of the basic elements of
healing. It is important for me to
make a political statement that
incorporates my passions and is
a glimpse of my visions. Indigo
had come with us, bringing her
drums; as we walked from the
parking lot to the supreme court
we played the drums, we passed
out shakers and drums. The
drums were (are) very powerful
for me. They seem to break up
thought patterns, change the
tone. I feel strong and strength-
ened when I beat the drum.

beating beating my heart
beating racing racing racing time
to heal the earth heartland sisters
re-sisters my heart quickens as I

see you strong clear shining
surrounded by your sisters...
Cora... with her scarf over
her eyes... blind justice... “only
narrow issues here” he says “this
is a very narrow issue” thump
thump “I have a statement to
read” she says. thump thump
“you'll have to contain your-
selves” he says as we give
Kathryn a standing ovation for
her words of strength and clear
vision. Other very dear to me
women Amazon warriors were
also there in support of
Kathryn... seeing each other
brightened our spirits and quick-
ened our souls.

Oh — I almost forgot —
before the trial when Ellen and I
began to sign and sing we
immediately had a circle of
women with us, singing and
signing along... it was an exhilar-
ating feeling. I came away feeling
strengthened and hopeful... per-
haps each one of the incidents is
just a grain of sand in crumbling
the patriarchy... yet they are a
source of renewal when we
empower each other with our
songs and hearts. Let our gather-
ing encircling all ways bring
envisionings...

Two days later in Barre a
vigil for Pamela Brown the 17
year old woman who was raped
and murdered in Barre during
the ethnic heritage festival...
standing in silence hands joined
in circle, a dozen or so of us... in
front of St. Monica’s church, the
scene of the atrocity, I silently
prayed for strength and clarity
and words... I'm so glad you
are all here said Niki, it helps me
feel like I’m not all alone... I
have an eleven year old daughter
and I am frightened of the
escalating violence against
women. I spoke... just this
morning I read that rape and
violence against women is the
largest growing crime in America.
We all spoke of the rape culture,
the reasons for violence against
women... an elderly Barre couple
listened intently but did they
hear???? All of Barre will hear
very shortly when the largest
Take Back The Night march in
Vermont takes place in Barre
Aug. 28 — we need to confront
the patriarchy consistently and
in large numbers... now more
than ever... we are everywhere
and we shall go forth...

Resistance Victories

A woman in Albuquerque,
NM saved herself from a rape
when she bit off part of the lip
of one of her attackers. The
would-be rapist was appre-
hended by police at a nearby
hospital, where he had gone to
seek treatment, and his accom-
plices were later picked up.

Lesbian Connection

On Sunday, March 1, Jean
Stover was assaulted in Palmer
Park in Detroit, MI. She studies
karate, as does her attacker.
After an intense fight, which
bloodied Jean's face, the attack-
er ran from her growing physi-
cal fury. She chased him. He
eventually got away. Now, she
waits to meet him again, deter-
mined to finish him off.

From Detroit Women’s Voices

A man in Arizona, previously
known for destroying cactus
plants, made his last stand with a
large saguaro cactus. He fired
his gun repeatedly at the cactus
which fell and killed him.

On December 4, 1981 the
Virginia Supreme Court ruled
that being a Lesbian or Gay man
is insufficient basis to take legal
parenthood away.
