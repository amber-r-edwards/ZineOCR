“The Torch
of Liberty is

A beacon of hope.
It warms
Those Who Hold
It High. It BURNS
Those Who Try To
EXTINGUISH IT.

Ronald Reagan 12/17/81
“Give me your tired, your poor,
Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free,
The wretched refuse of your teeming shore.
Send these, the homeless, tempest-tost to me,
I lift my lamp beside the golden door.”
