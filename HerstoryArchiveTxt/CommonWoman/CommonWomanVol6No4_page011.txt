VICTIM COUNSELING

Submitted by Johannia Jordan

When a person is injured,  
whether by accident or assault,  
slightly or severely, there are a  
lot of feelings which surface.  
Part of the recovery process is to  
share and release those feelings  
with another person. Our experi-  
ence has taught us that when  
people get a chance to laugh,  
cry, or shake out the feelings, it  
releases them. We don’t stop the  
hurt by stopping the crying —  
the crying (laughing, etc.) is  
getting rid of the hurt! Here are  
some tips on assisting someone  
immediately after an incident:

1. Make sure immediate  
medical needs are taken care of;  
either by you or by someone  
else.

2. If there is no serious  
physical injury, take the person  
to a safe place, away from the  
scene.

3. Stay calm and LISTEN.

4. Get the person’s atten-  
tion. Get them to pay attention  
to you — ask questions, “Who  
are you?” “Hello,” “What do  
you see when you look at me?”  
“What else?” If a person is  
hysterical you must get their  
attention before you proceed.

Help them to feel safe now.  
Listen. Ask them to be aware of  
things around them, the sky, a  
picture, the texture of a sweater,  
etc. Things which are safe,  
removed from what happened.  
This is very important in shock.

5. Once you have their  
attention, encourage them to  
talk about what happened, to  
feel the feelings and release the  
emotions. The sooner after the  
incident the easier it is going to  
be for someone to remember  
and allow the feelings to flow.  
However, even if it has been  
several weeks or months the  
feelings may be released.

Have them tell you the  
story and/or repeat phrases that  
are connected to the feelings,  
i.e., “It was really scary,” “I  
hurt” (new physical injury),  
“Oh (brightly) I’m scared.”

FROM THE  
PRODUCERS

The seventh Michigan  
Womyn’s Music Festival will  
take place this August 12-15.

Since 1976, the producers have  
struggled with their definition  
of who they were and if indeed  
they were really a collective.  
Due to unequally shared respon-  
sibility, the conclusion was  
reached that, not a collec-  
tive, but only two womyn, Lisa  
and Kristie Vogel, are doing the  
bulk of the production work,  
although the many womyn who  
have participated in the past are  
seen as an important driving  
force that helped make the  
festival what it is today.

The festival as a business has  
grown, and with the possibility  
of purchasing 650 acres of land  
near Hesperia, possible changes  
in legal structure are also being  
explored. Visions for potential  
uses of this land include: confer-  
ence space for political causes,  
gathering space for womyn in-  
volved in womyn-defined busi-  
nesses, year-round resort space,  
and well-equipped resource and  
meeting facility. Eventually, sup-  
port systems including perman-  
ent structures, water and septic  
improvements, electrical and  
communications will be added.  
The actual ownership and  
administrative details and vari-  
ous methods of national community  
access will be dealt with in a structure  
separate from the one that now  
guides the Michigan festival. If  
actually revised from its non-  
profit corporation status, further  
discussion on reasons for the  
change and the process now  
happening will be made avail-  
able, closer to the time of this  
becoming reality.

Festival growth has brought  
a greater degree of financial  
solvency. Begun on volunteer  
labor, the festival now pays  
more than 100 womyn to  
coordinate certain areas of the  
festival. These coordinators have  
usually worked at the festival for  
at least one year in a  
capacity.

Training has become more of a cooperative  
venture between the producers  
and the coordinators. Presently,  
an elected group takes responsi-  
bility to solicit suggestions and  
criticisms from all the coor-  
dinators on important policy  
and organizational issues. From  
this information they try to  
arrive at the general consensus of  
the group.

The festival began as a  
dream as most creations do.  
Michigan for many womyn has  
been an energizer, giving them  
the strength to go back and  
live in a world where it takes a  
lot of strength to live. The  
baseline is that Michigan is  
trying to create an environment  
where womyn feel safe (above  
all), affirmed, can enjoy them-  
selves and each other, can share  
information, are taken care of  
and take care of each other, and  
can be themselves. The festival is  
a community of womyn working  
and playing together. We all  
make it work; the idea is coop-  
erative sisterhood.

Aside from support at the  
festival, through participating in  
work shifts, this year Michigan  
can use monetary donations,  
loans or donated fundraising  
time to facilitate land purchase.  
The festival address is: WWTMC,  
1501 Lyons Ave., Mt. Pleasant,  
Michigan 48858.

LISTEN.  
Repeat back phrases like  
“They took your purse.” “It  
frightened you.” Use the per-  
son’s own words, not what you  
think they meant but what  
they actually said.

LISTEN

Ask questions which focus  
on feelings, i.e., “Was it scary?”  
“What scared you?” “How did  
you feel?”

6. Maintain eye contact and  
some kind of physical contact.  
Often a hand on the arm,  
holding the person's hand or an  
arm around the shoulder is  
helpful. If the person is frighten-  
ed, gently but firmly hold them,  
and if they are physically able,  
have them hold on to you.

In cases of SHOCK — touch  
is very important. When some-  
one is going into shock or is in  
shock, they need physical con-  
tact, assurance and reassurance.  
Make them look at you, talk to  
you. Gently insist on them  
paying attention to you and  
encourage any crying or shaking  
that starts. Shock is heightened  
by fear. If they are deeply in  
shock, then keep up a steady,  
warm, loving stream of reassur-  
ance, say nice things to them  
and about them. Lie down next  
to them and hold onto them and  
have them hang onto you unless  
physical injury makes it impos-  
sible.

7. Assist emotional release.  
Emotions are released in laugh-  
ing, crying, shaking, and storm-  
ing. Also yawning! Encourage  
the feelings to flow from talking  
to the laughter, crying, etc. Be  
warm, caring, and undistressed —  
bright! Your reassurance and  
warmth makes it safe for the  
person to cry. Encourage the  
person to release the emotions.  
“Go ahead and cry (laugh,  
shake), that’s fine.” “Here, hang  
onto me and shake.” “It’s OK to  
cry, I’m listening.” If they are  
angry, offer a pillow or balled up  
coat to punch.

Most important, listen! If a  
person is crying, simply put your  
arm around them and tell them  
“I’m listening.” They will do  
what they need to. Just encour-  
age them to stay with it. After  
it’s all over get someone to listen  
to you. Also remember the  
person may need to talk-cry  
more than once. It’s good to  
follow up on them.

Let the person have their  
feelings, but do not get caught in  
them.

DO NOT:

—offer cigarettes or alco-  
holic drinks — they cut off  
feelings.

—sympathize — feel sorry  
for or over-exaggerate the seri-  
ousness of the situation (one  
person upset is enough).

—tell them of your stories  
of similar situations or what  
happened to Aunt Jane.

—belittle the feelings or cut  
them off with things like, “Stop  
it. Pull yourself together.” or “It  
wasn’t all that bad.”
