To die at the

Marched for peace  
Ek'to feed you  
My boy, enough to fill your bones  
To feed your hopes  

Satisfied  

By one mother’s heart  
You cry and say:  
It’s hopeless. I can bear to die but  
I can't bear to think, there’ll be  
No earth after me.”

There must be Black unity  

Where there can be

My Answer to the Reagan Budget  

If my rage  

Could be liquefied as tears  

Thickened into pasta  

Compressed—and sliced as  

Spaghetti  

There would be enough  

To feed  

The Earth’s children,

LAST YEAR WAS THE YEAR AFTER THE YEAR  
OF THE CHILD (IT’S WORSE THIS YEAR)  

The year  
After the Year of the Child  

Congress calls for a cut  
In food stamps of families  

Whose children receive free lunches  
In school  

(At 30 cents per child per meal per day)  
And  
Vermont lawmakers say corporal punishment  
In schools is okay.  
The year after the Year of the Child  
America is celebrating  
By beating them more  
And  
Feeding them less.

To a Congressional Aide  

Who Wanted to Take Billions from the  
Social Programs and Put Them into Defense  

The Poor  
The poor will always be with us,  
You say.  
And I bet  
Your great-great-great-great-great  

Grandfather  

Said to one of his girlfriends:  
“We've always had cannibalism  
And you girls can’t stop us!

When Men Say  

When men say  
They are equally violated/equally oppressed  
I say  
If you are as tortured as we are  
Don’t hit us over the head with Freud  
Rise up and break your chains!  
—Phyllis R. Sawyer
