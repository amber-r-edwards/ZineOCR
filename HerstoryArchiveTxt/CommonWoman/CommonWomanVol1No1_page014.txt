Penile Penetration

resultant fear from
every intercourse of possible
pregnancy. Not one birth
control method is one hundred
percent effective, or one
hundred percent safe. My own
medical heterosexual history of
nine years is full of various
venereal diseases, infections,
birth control hassles, chemical
creams, cancer-inducing pills,
semi-daily migraine headaches
(while taking the pill), one
abortion, three miscarriages, one
IUD perforation, and one full
term pregnancy. Pregnancy was
perhaps the most continuous
daily fear. My lesbian medical
herstory is devoid of all of the
above. I have had two yeast
infections in three years. I do
not fear pregnancy. I do not feel
my body is being invaded while
making love. I could choose to
get pregnant but I do not dread
it (except by rape — you know,

have the

somebody trying to show me
that all I really need is a good
fuck).

I asked many women that
heard me talk at the abortion
rally, ‘Why have you allowed
yourself to be penetrated?’ I
asked myself the same question.
Because it feels good to my
lover. Because that’s the way to
make love, isn’t it? Because no
man would stand for it if I said
“No!” (i.e. rape). Because I like
it. Because I want to get
pregnant... The only real good
reason is the last. I believe that
responsible heterosexual
lovemaking would not as a habit
include penile penetration. Only
if the woman wants to be
pregnant and fully understands
what motherhood (in a culture
that hates and oppresses women,
mothers and children) is all
about, should she allow herself
to be penetrated.

Liking to be touched inside
your vaginas, women, I can
understand. Be touched, yes, but
not with penises. There has
come up one confusion about
this issue that I need to clarify. I
like to be touched inside my
vagina. However, I don’t like to
be touched quickly in and out.
Being touched like that reminds
me too much of intercourse and
I'd just as soon forget
intercourse. I remember
wondering if I’d miss intercourse
if I chose to make love solely
with women. I DO NOT. I don’t
imitate heterosexual lovemaking.
I don’t fingerfuck. I do not use
dildos. A few weeks ago a street
heckler asked me and my lover
as we walked arm in arm on the
street, ‘Who’s wearing the dildo
tonight?’ He imagined that I
would imitate his sexuality and
he found that repulsive.

All the other reasons women
gave me for allowing penile
penetration don’t feel valid
enough to balance the incredible
hassle it is for women.
Lovemaking does not need to
include intercourse to be
enjoyable.

As a lesbian feminist I believe
women/women relationships
have the potential to be more
healthy and natural than
women/men relationships. I
want women to free themselves
from the unequal power
imbalance in heterosexual
relationships. I also know that
all women will not stop making
love with men — that’s not what
I'm asking here. I’m saying don’t
let them penetrate you (unless
you want to be pregnant).
Feminist women in
Burlington have told me that
this thought is unsupportive of
straight feminists and of women
in general. I believe that much
work must be done among
lesbians and heterosexual
feminists to produce an
inter-support system in this and
any political community. But I
believe in a system of support
that includes questioning and
that means we must have trust
and hard work. That supportive
questioning is for me a necessity
that I don’t want to exchange
for non-supportive ignoring. To
ignore the issue of penile
penetration is unsupportive.
Feminists must examine the
politics of fucking. Fucking is
ownership, property,
dominance. Conventional
heterosexual activity
(intercourse) is not a show of
love — no man is loving a woman
at the same time that he burdens
her body with the result of his
pleasure. Feminists, lesbian and
straight, must talk about the
politics of sexuality, sensuality,
affection, women loving women
and women loving men. To value
penetration as the only valid
sexuality is a heterosexist
concept. All feminists must see
that this concept hurts women
and apply this politic to their
own lovemaking. I praise you
Burlington lesbian women for
your open sharing on sexual
issues.

“Oppression begins where
life begins, in the act of fucking,
and revolution must begin in the
same place, or it has not begun
at all.” (Andrea Dworkin from
“Marx and Engels Were Liberals
— Feminism and the ‘Radical’
Left’ p. 6.)
