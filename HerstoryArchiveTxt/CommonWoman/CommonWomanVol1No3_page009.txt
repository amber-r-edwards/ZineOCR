Sexual advances
in a range of attacks from
the subtlest comment to the
most aggressive act of violence.
In a survey by Red Book
magazine (1976), 88% of 9,000
women had experienced at least
one unwanted sexual advance at
work. It is a much more
common occurrence than we are
led to believe. It often continues
unchecked because women are
reluctant to take action against
their boss or fellow (male)
employees for fear of losing
their job, being reprimanded,
given increased work loads, or
receiving poor personal reports.

The last area I want to
explore is unions. Since many
women are part-time and
temporary workers they are not
eligible to join anyway. But,
even for those women who do
work full time, the union is
often not interested in or
responsive to their special needs
and concerns. Only 12.5% of all
women workers are unionized.
Unions are predominately ruled
and controlled by men. They are
not committed to raising issues
related to child care, maternity
leave, affirmative action or equal
pay for equal work. Women are
just beginning to demand a
larger representation in unions.
It is more difficult for women to
be active, though, because they
have a “second job” as
housewife or mother within the
home. Therefore they have less
time to organize and attend
meetings.

I don't want to end with this
general summary of women and
work. I haven’t even touched on
topics like full-time, unpaid
housewives and their crucial role
in the economy, volunteerism,
the unequal educational and
training opportunities available
to women and affirmative
action. These are all important
and related topics. I'd rather
back up the points in this article
with first-hand information
about the lives of women who
work. What are their jobs like?
