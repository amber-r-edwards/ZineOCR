fear claws at me  
a harsh chattering  
in the back of my mind.  
every day I fear for you,  
my child,  
that a cop will shoot you  
in the back —  
Clifford Glover style —  
though you are a girl.  
when you stand up for yourself  
you're being an “uppity nigger”  
(a girl besides).  
*you're three times more likely  
to be raped, assaulted, killed  
to have an unnecessary operation than any — any —

A little one,  
I fear for you.  
beware  
of your enemies —  
and more especially —  
your friends.

‘A Very Womanly Poem (1977)  

‘O Sister Half-Moon,  
why do you make me cry?  

Do you miss the time of darkness  
the for seeking out your mate?  
Do you aspire to fullness  

where a sign of cycles awaits?  

‘Caught between ebb & flow  
without a place to hide  

in darkness...  

without a place to shine  

in full beauty.  

Do you share with me  
the pain  
in that place of halfness...  

Dinner time — Lez Beans again  
mmm so good  
I can make them melt in my mouth,  

Gotta real taste for those beans of yours, momma,  

Mother Earth’s finest!!  
seem to be dreaming about them all the time —  
can’t get enough — breakfast lunch all day long  

I'm tasting Lez Beans in my mind  
can’t wait till you come home for supper  

I got you hanging on the edge of time  
tongue teasing tasting touching  
slippery warm moving you  
feel it moving me too.

The Passionate Flow  

My soft red underwear  

Welcomes my moon cycle’s first flush.  

I wear them in celebration;  

My body's sea rhythm, again at full tide.  

Pale teardrops gush bright red;  

A rich and musky wine, salty to the tongue.  
Belly heavy, tender nippled, tight thighed,  

I dance the tension free.  

‘Sweat sheen glistens.  

Prism of sad relief and passion  
Rainbows on my wall;  

No longer earth-bound am I  

Drunk  

‘Oh sweet basil  
the perfume,  

mad stiff leafed  

green liquor perfume.  

My throat goes thick  

and sugary  

with just a hand of leaves.  
I'm brought to my knees  
by an armful.  

Mother have mercy  

I want to anoint  

with wet summer  

smear lickbite  

draw in  

breath after breath  

drink  

leaf after leaf.

Confessions of a Teacher  
I put my hand casually  

to my face during second period  
today and smiled as I smelled  
the wetness from her vagina,  
So glad I didn’t wash my hands  
this morning. I've been bringing  
my hand to my face all day.  
Lv.  

dance the knowledge of my own clear sight,  

Old fears run rivulets down my arms,  
Form floor puddles to lubricate my feet.  
‘My woman's shame has taken flight.  

I wear soft red underwear.  

A proud pagan — hidden no more in the menstrual hut,  

Dancing and leaping before the fire,  
Cherishing my body and my blood.  

—Tania Elizabeth Hurie  

This Cow  

This cow put  
her big body down.  

Her udder lay by itself,  
soft and half-full  

with long pink teats  

still wet from the milker.  

I put my hands  
to my own breasts,  

holding the weight  

of them out,  

watching my nipples grow  

long and pink  

with the thought of this morning  
and your milker’s mouth.

Heat Poem (1981)  

On the pink rug in the kitchen  
you laid me out.  

I am coming into heat.  

Male cats stalking  

their insistent movements  

prod their way into my consciousness.  

Under the avocado  
we roll.  

Over and over.  

Burrowing into the pink pile,  
the moss ground cover  

of our domicile.  

Still untamed,  

my mind stalks the  
night moon rising.  
Alone in that place  

of memories, I wander.  

There you call out  
from your bedplace,  
wondering,  
when I will return.  
—Maryann Fariello  

‘The Red Moon (1980)  

We make love  
beneath the red moon  
like we hadn't  
in a long time.  
It is on the wane  
but still shines,  
—Maryann Fariello  

Peggy's House  

I have a strong sense  
of place*  

And this space  

Holds my second birth,  

My second becoming:  
‘Woman/lesbian/woman,  

No longer just  

‘My mother's daughter.  

I never imagined  

‘Such giving, such taking  

As I first experienced here,  
This central room  

‘That bed which held us two  
Your red hair  

Flamed between my thighs  

And my night settled between your legs.  

Peggy's house  
Became the place  
Of my second birth —  
Mightier than the first  
And more painful.  
—Michiyo Cornell  
“This is from Toni Morrison  

Sicily  

In Sicily it thunders  
softly and long,  

like slow passion.  

The light and sound have thick  
sweetness,  

fruited, sensual  

‘Oh the grapes there,  

how pale and firm they are  
like little breasts perfumed,  
slid between teeth  

waiting to halve them  

and tongue out the seeds,  

PAT Festa 9/80  

Still, In the Smooth of You  

your mouth  
curves  

shout at me  
to wet them  

you touch  
such exquisite  
my body weeps  
shaking  

sweet salts  

my body laughter  
peals and peals  
riding  

the wild  

dancing bell ropes.  

my skin slicks  
and prickles  
surprised,  
still,  
in the smooth  
of you,  
the curves that hold my hand

Body Aching Gently  
Quiet reminder of many hours awake  
holding, touching, sharing you —  
Gentle aches comforting  
Reminders of a night of loving rhythms  
When I breathed with you  
And heard the ocean in our sounds.  

A gesture reminds  

I slide my hand between my thighs  

to scratch a mosquito bite  

but my mind whirls dizzy as I feel  

all the things that motion conjures  

Reach down  

to touch the lips there  

blood comes out between them so  

I slide my hand into my pants  

to check there if I think I’m bleeding  

to see what color the wet is  

if I'm going to spot the seat in the deli  

My hands cuddle there where I curl up cold  
in Vermont winters like a fetus  

gimme a little warmth, huh?  

My arm moves through space my hand  
floats downward to love myself there  

to massage some cares my hand used  

to reach down to touch a wound there  

if I'd been fucked and was dry if I was hurt  
and now sometimes I reach down to fetch  
a little perfume for the evening if I'm  
feeling frisky and know I'll be seeing  
someone who loves smelling a familiar shared smell  
‘of moss and beach sand and mud  

Of course leapfrog, too, long ago  
over Pam's back and Carol's  
all arched strongly under brightly colored dresses  
in fields of long long grass  

Laurie Larsun  

sweet woman  
that way  
‘mischievous eyes oh wicked woman  
how you delight me — “entice me  
simple now to touch your warm body  
no hesitation after all these months  
knowing how warm how wet when  

I explore your deep country  

when you look at me  

climb on into bed and let's get lost  
let the moon bring us home later  

with my wicked ha ha wicked tongue  
I can play you like a kite  
march winds my breath becomes and  
‘let you climb high high then  
hold you there — aching for me  
to let you loose mmmmmm  
I love this game of flying you  
—I winkler  

‘We Do Not Touch  

‘We pass close by every day.  
We talk. We laugh. We do  
not touch. We know our love  
is forbidden, but I see in  
your sad, sweet, brown eyes  
that you have the same wants  
as I do, I know it's too hard  
for you to challenge society.  
I feel sorry for you that you  
feel you must ignore your  
feelings and pretend in order  
to protect yourself from the  
harsh judgment of our society

June's, Sharon’s and Debbi's  

In the morning  
you leave me with a wet cunt  

my bed made  

and a hot note to be read in the afternoon  

To entice me you describe your nipples hard against my bathrobe  
I picture them and pant.  
Sister of words and silence — I'm hysterical with  
what you've given freely  

You guiding your cunt against my knee  

Your love like a fiddlehead fern unfolding  
Bringing me to milkweed  

and cattails.  

I love you because you believe in love like leaves turning in winter  
because you believe in plagiarism  
and desire  
because you rescue frogs  
because you leave me with rose petals  
and poetry.

Ocean Poem (1977)  

Ocean lover  
take this Picean waterchild  
into your arms.  

Your salty taste  

fills my mouth with joy.  

Fuck Girl*  

"Incest drives one crazy  

A thousand icy tongues In the literal sense.  

lick my breasts To be a hole  

as I make my way deep For a penis or a tongue  

into the quiet Or a finger  

of your belly womb. Is cruelty to last/  
—Maryann Fariello A lifetime.  

I was a fucking hole;  
No longer am one.  
But pain is not purged  
Flee With these words;  
The pain goes on.  
Words only tell  
What was/is/could be  
And rescue my sanity.  
—Michiyo Cornell  
*A line from Diane Wrede Mortier's cycle  
of poems on different women inspired  
this title,  

The feeling’s strong,  

but I don’t mind if you  

don’t stay long. You can  

love me tonight and with  

the sunrise be gone. I won't  

try to hold you down cuz  

love is just a game we play  

when we need someone around.
