Winter Events  

By Joan Tennessee  

How would you like to be  
part of a winter hike? Or better  
yet, an overnighter on the trail!  
Maybe you would prefer staying  
at home at night in case the  
phone rings, there'll be someone  
to answer it. Well, really, girls,  
that’s the only comfort home  
has, that winter camping  
doesn’t. Hey, I know we all get  
cold even at home, especially if  
you have gas or electric heat. So  
why not try to gear yourself up  
for winter sports and enjoy  
yourself? I’ve mentioned this  
idea of sleeping on snow over on  
the mountain to some friends,  
but they seem to have had a bad  
experience or can’t comprehend  
how someone could have fun  
that way. Let's get together and  
talk about what was hard or not  
a good time. Then try it again.  
Maybe we could start with a day  
hike with snowshoes or skis, and  
get to know each other. Don't  
worry about equipment, just  
come and let's talk about how  
much fun we could have. If  
there’s interest, then we'll get  
the necessities later. By the way,  
I've been winter camping a lot  
and I’ve spent some of the  
warmest time on many a Ver-  
mont mountain. Hopefully we  
can get someone with a camera  
to come so you can see how  
warm you were. Call me at  
864-6712.

The Saints’ Collective is  
alive and well in Boston and  
getting close to reopening the  
much-missed bar. This time they  
hope it will be in a whole,  
women-owned building. Sandy is  
picking women’s brains for ideas  
for the dance floor — of top  
importance are comfort, sen-  
suousness, a feeling of warmth  
and encouragement for women  
to relax and dance, even if they  
never have. Nothing is too far  
out. If you have ideas, send  
them ASAP to The Collective,  
P.O. Box 39, W. Somerville, Ma.  
02144, (The entire building will  
be wheelchair accessible.)
