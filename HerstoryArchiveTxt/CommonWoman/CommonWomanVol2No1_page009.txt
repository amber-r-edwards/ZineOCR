TANGLED VINES  
for Lyn Lifshin  

Daughter, we were told  

was the common name of the orange tuberous  
weed like a deadly potato eye strangling  

the ivy bed. My mother  

could have been a botanist  

the way she studied plants  

gloxinia, bottle bush, bonsai, calla lily  

but for the parasite  

she had no fond regard.  

She had four daughters herself  

and understood, when my father could not hinder  

the vegetable tendrils carried by spores  
down from the gray and arid Sierra Madres  
by daily weeding or spraying,  
that it was time to get the experts.  
It bothered me to name a weed the thing  
we were, me and my sisters,  
as if it made a problem of us, too  
and to have my mother stare  
placidly through the living room window  
across the rising yard to the ivy  
and then up to the mountains from whence,  
she often said, cometh our help  
while outside the daughter  
was finally poisoned  
as cleanly stripped by the gardener  
from all that lush and miniaturized greenery  
as iris yellow grows away from stem.

Spinning, twisting  

Stop. Cobalt below.  

Blue.  
Circles, circling two dimensionally.  
The spin of  
Vibrating intestines  
Fill.  
Twist. Spin. That place.  
Take that.  
Give that.  
Negative spot  
Finger.

OCEANS  

Oceans  

within me  

wash over these sand dunes  
and leave tiny ripples  

that I may walk upon  

and think about  

what it’s like  

to be on the bottom  

On the bottom  

beneath a natural pressure  
being shifted  

being stirred  

being thrown on the beach  
with spray  

pounded upon the earth.  

Panting  
Resting  
Then waiting  
The first of every growth,  
The last of every era.

1975  
st year when you were leaving  

there were losses that I knew  
spaces  

where your table used to stand  
nobody there when I woke  

and then there was one morning  
sitting  
getting dressed  

the sunshine on the edge of my bed  
when you walked in  

and I  

who had lived like Eve in the garden  

was suddenly ugly  
and clutching my clothes  

cowering from the blow  
of your indifferent gaze  

after you left  

my eyes filled with the stinging salt of shame  

and the door into Eden swung shut
