A number of us have been  
protesting the exploitation of  
women’s bodies, with its result-  
ing violence against women, at  
the Spruce Goose bar and the  
Twin City porn store in Barre,  
and other places in Vermont. We  
have been trying to alert and  
inform the public about the  
danger of promoting the porno-  
graphic (prostitute) image of  
woman, as in the legs contests.  
Many of us work in the battered  
women’s movement and are  
aware of the consequences of  
such portrayal for women and  
children. We see the problems of  
rape, battering, incest and all  
forms of male dominance/super-  
iority increasing. Police report  
pornography involved in every  
investigated case of rape-murder.  
Children are being exposed to  
pornography, romance and rape  
rather than sex education.  
Things are not improving, they  
are getting worse.  

A woman stands with us in  
the cold on her way into the  
Spruce Goose and speaks of her  
fears for her young sister and  
brother, and for herself. She  
talks about her boyfriend hurt-  
ing her and how painful it was,  
and said she didn’t like any of  
it... but she didn’t like the  
protestors either, and you can’t  
change things anyway and a missed  
legs contest was one of those  
her boyfriend might ‘kill her’...  
and into the bar she went. We told her the  
local battered women’s hotline,  
Central Vermont Shelter Project,  
would help her, that there was a  
network of safe homes for  
refuge (not unlike the under-  

Words Are Keys  
By Myra Lilliane  

Words are keys. Words from  
the outside, spoken and written  
by wimmin were keys to open  
the damaged, locked insides and  
free power.  

Meeting my hidden,  
unknown, locked away reality in  
the words of other wimmin  
meant that I could begin to own,  
to understand, to heal. I no  
longer hate myself; I no longer  
blame myself for the way I  
survived as a girlchild and adult  
woman, lesbian.  

Key words like: sexism,  
oppression, patriarchy and  
homophobia unveiled myths  
about reality. A key sentence  
was: It’s not my/our fault.  
Womon, incest survivor, healer,  
amazon, I need these  
words that are keys to truth. All  
the hidden, all the unspeakable  
needs words in order to be  
visible in reality, to be changed.  

One creates reality with  
language, images, thoughts,  
belief systems. When enough  
people believe something to be  
reality, it becomes reality.

ground railroad for black slaves  
and present-day network for  
‘third-world’ refugees from  
oppression). This fear, the abuse  
and contempt for women has  
gotten that bad, and it is getting  
worse. The statistics are so  
overwhelming that for many it is  
easier to shut it all out, to be a  
‘good girl’ or ‘good sport’ in the  
illusion that nothing will happen  
to one, than to take a risk and  
protest the abuse. Many women  
who understand the sexist,  
oppressive and demeaning mes-  
sage of pornography, in the  
media and in contests judging  
our bodies, haven’t come to our  
demonstrations because they  
have been afraid, apathetic or  
haven't liked our tactics or  
wanted to be perceived as a  
‘man-hater’ or ‘queer,’ or have  
been too busy, tired, broke or  
disgusted with everything and  
“you can’t change anything any-  
way.’ We say if you don’t agree  
with our tactics, invent some of  
your own! Come on, wake up,  
look at what is happening! There  
is a war going on against women  
and children, people of color,  
working people, the elderly,  
against this planet and all of  
nature... and all for the sake of  
rich men’s profits! Why aren't  
there one or two thousand  
women and others joining us  
demanding an end to the porno-  

we all go right from  
stores and contests to  
military recruitment stations?  
Follow the wonderful example  
of Thundercloud, Hans Benschop  
and Kim Blacklock! As  
Andrea Dworkin explains in  
Right Wing Women, there is a  

Words are keys to new or  
denied realities. From servants,  
second citizens, housewives,  
mothers, lonely maids and vic-  
tims, we became and are becom-  
ing survivors, amazons, healers,  
witches, dykes, lovers, explorers,  
revolutionaries, celebrators.  

We are no longer merely a  
mirror in which men can see  
themselves bigger than they are.  
We have an identity of our own,  
a language of our own, a culture  
that reflects our womon experi-  
ences and realities. We became  
and are becoming strong and  
proud individuals with our com-  
mon tribal womon/lesbian lan-  
guage.  

Words have been used by  
men to imprison us in myth and  
half truth. For feminists, words  
are keys to free the locked up  
womonself and to destroy false  
images.  

Taboo and denial outside of  
us as well as internalized, form  
the walls that block and separate  
the socially acceptable from the  
socially unacceptable. We have  
learned that the socially accept-  

able is/was whatever benefits the  
ones in power; basically capitalism  
and the patriarchy. When we  
break the taboo in large num-  
bers, the separation between  
acceptable and unacceptable  
changes. Naming the unspeak-  
able, finding words to name the  
truth of our womon reality, we  
open the doors in the wall that  
separates and keeps our deepest  
selves locked. We have been  
exploring, excavating and dis-  
covering the keys, the words  
that set us free, that give us  
strength. We have been naming  
and are naming male violence  
against girls and wimmin and  
have created hotlines, shelters,  
centers, support groups, news-  
letters and celebrations.  

It is when — as wimmin —  
we meet, speaking the truth,  
that we find the key words that  
open the doors to our deepest  
experiences. We find out we are  
not the only one. We discover  
that we make sense; we are not  
crazy. We name the unspeakable,  
we name our oppression and  
fight it. We name our strength  
and heal.  

conditions, along with marriage.  
A ‘good’ woman is not sexual,  
she does her ‘duty.’ Of course  
the same is not true for men,  
with their so-called base natures,  
which is where the ‘role of  
prostitute comes in, created by  
and for patriarchs-white, male  
supremists. Patriarchal sexual  
morality and stereotyping are  
alienating and vicious perver-  
sions of nature. Repression and  
rationing of sexuality creates a  
market for sex, which profit-  
minded people like pornogra-  
phers rush to exploit. Putting  
the ‘blame’ for sex on women  
and creating a culture of male  
dominance makes women and  
children the objects of this  
exploitation, with dire conse-  
quences resulting.  
Women Against Porno-  
graphy, a national women’s  
organization, in opposing sexist  
Hanes stocking ads, said, “By  
reducing women to ‘sexy legs’  
for men to leer at, Hanes (sub-  
stitute Spruce Goose) is helping  
to promote a climate of con-  
tempt for women that ultimate-  
ly leads to sexual violence. No  
women are protected from this  
kind of sexualized hatred, not  
even the wives, daughters, sis-  
ters, mothers, etc. of Hanes  
executives.” In protesting sexist  
video games, Women Against  
Pornography noted that “such  
games (substitute contests) offer  
men the opportunity to partici-  
pate in the devaluation and  
ridicule of women, taking males  
one step closer to real life  
violence against women. In  
social situations these games  
pressure and condition women  
to participate in their own  

Is incest the last taboo we  
speak about and share, breaking  
the isolation and lies? Denial of  
truth and experiences like incest,  
separates the experiences from  
reality. It creates confusion. It  
makes us feel bad, guilty, makes  
us feel as if something is wrong  
with us.  

To speak the key words, to:  
break the taboo and denial does  
hurt. It is no longer possible to  
say that the horrible did not  
happen.  

Without the walls the exper-  
ience is liberated. The pain of  
being hurt and damaged, flows  
out, no longer locked away.  
Now the wound no longer  
festers in darkness. The poison  
oozes out and with support and  
love, the healing can happen.  
The confusion, separation and  
depression can disappear. The  
energy of keeping the walls up is  
freed to heal, to become a more  
complete, healthy and self-loving  
person. It may hurt but we heal.  

We are healers when we  
speak the truth, opening the  
doors to what really happened,  
is happening, while accepting the  

objectification and ridicule, or  
risk being called a prude, poor  
sport, humorless or worse. The  
presence of such games in bars  
reinforces the idea that bars are  
male territory, places for ‘scor-  
ing,’ for sexual conquest.”  

A Times Argus editorial  
apologizing for their Spruce  
Goose photo ad was hypocritical  
and missed the point, if the  
Times-Argus was concerned  
about the ad, which showed  
actual photos revealing the por-  
nographic reality of the contest,  
why would they not be more  
concerned about the actual  
event? Another editorial spoke  
of ‘good taste and decency’ in  
reference to community stan-  
dards on the matter. The issue is  
not ‘good taste,’ ‘decency,’  
‘obscenity,’ nudity or any other  
misleading definition of porno-  
graphy. The issue is woman-  
hatred, and the vicious conse-  
quences of promoting woman-  
hatred, some of which are  
battering, rape and incest.  

For good reading on the  
subject, get anything written by  
Andrea Dworkin and other  
feminist writers. People can  
write to: Women Against Porno-  
graphy, 358 W. 47th St., N.Y.,  
N.Y. 10036, for their informa-  
tive newsletter, and join their  
local battered women's groups.  
We hope to see many more  
supporters at the next demon-  
stration. We are sure there will  
need to be more protests, since  
cultural conditioning is hard to  
overcome. Our minds have been  
closed by it for thousands of  
years (read: Woman’s Creation  
by Elizabeth Fisher).  

pain, nursing the wounds, seeing  
our Beauty, strength and know-  
ledge, loving each other.  

We need each other to find  
the words, the keys to name the  
reality of violence against wim-  
min, age infant to crone, to heal  
it and stop it.  

We are like archeologists  
digging deep in the ground,  
excavating the proofs of a  
different culture. Only, our  
culture is a blend of past,  
present and future. While we  
uncover and discover, we also  
create and give life to new  
words, new ways, new realities,  
new lifestyles, according to our  
experiences.  

Are there more words that  
are keys to opening walls we are  
unaware or barely conscious of?  
What are the future words that  
are keys to vaguely felt, unex-  
plored rooms? To what spaces  
do words like psychic power,  
visionary, wildness, insanity, sur-  
realism lead us to? We know  
about oppression and internal-
