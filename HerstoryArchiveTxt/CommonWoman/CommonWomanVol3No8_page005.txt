VMI. COMMONWOMAN DECEMBER

By Tomyris

This is for all you new, or
new to Burlington, Amazons out
there who want to know the
basics of setting up your space
(Oldspeak: apartment) for your
new life. We won't consider
houses because it’s nearly impos-
sible to own one and still be
politically correct in Burlington.

Your work will be judged
on the basis of originality
(within the general theme of
womon-space), Creativity, num-
ber of feminist elements in-
corporated, ingenuity of acquisi-
tion of these elements, and low
cost of total. (In Burlington it’s
very unchic to have money,
because it comes from oppress-
ing the working classes.) Points
are awarded for ingenuity and

wlowness of cost.

“requirement,
= space itself should be old

and have some sort of funkiness
connected with it, like having
the toilet in a former clothes
closet. You will never see
anything like it in Apartment
Life.

Let’s start with the most
important room first, namely
the kitchen. It is not P.C.
(politically correct) to have a
dishwasher. It is preferred that
you not have any appliances
other than stove and refrigera-
tor; however, you may keep your
blender or toaster oven if they’re
leftovers from your former life.
Your table and chairs can be
acquired in one of several ways:
0 points for buying a new
dinette set; 1 point if you have a
dinette set left over from your
marriage or former monogamous
relationship or if your parents
gave it to you; 5 if you got it at
the Salvation Army and nothing
matches; 25 if you rescued it
piece by piece from other
people's trash (the same goes for
your other furniture).

A basic awareness of health
is necessary so your kitchen
must be well stocked with jars
full of grains and beans and
other dried stuff from your
friendly neighborhood co-op or
organic food store. You must
have granola. The fact that you
hate granola does not obviate
the necessity of having it. You
must have lots of different kinds
of tea: herb, Chinese (loose, not
teabags), and some medicinal
teas such as skullcap and mul-
lein. Needless to say, you must
know what the medicinal ones
are for. Also needless to say,
Lipton flo-thru teabags are not
recommended. There must be a

bamboo strainer for the tea. It
doesn’t matter how you acquired
your dishes and utensils but
nothing must match anything
else. You must learn to eat
with chopsticks.

If you do have P.C. (polit-
ically incorrect) food in your
house, don't worry. Everyone has
a package of white flour or sugar
or Prince macaroni or something
like that that your mother gave
you and you don’t want to
throw it out because you don’t
like to waste food. You may also
have on hand a can of Camp-
bell's soup or some other junk
food that your mother fed you
as a child for when you really
can’t get it together. You store
these things in a corner behind
other things so that it’s obvious

you don’t use them. The
small jar of Maxwell House for
when your unemployment runs
out may be kept in the open. A
stash of chocolate is also OK.
Addiction to chocolate is under-
stood and tolerated while addic-
tion to cigarettes is not.

Next we'll make a brief stop
at the bathroom. We'll assume it
comes with all the usual cera-
mics. It should contain men-
strual sponges, Tiger Balm, a
loofah sponge, Community Soap
Factory soap, and may also
contain Tom's coconut soap,
Barth's seaweed toothpaste or
similar products. It should be
amply supplied with feminist
reading matter. A lunar calendar
which you mark with a bloody
fingerprint on the first day
of your period is a nice touch.
Anything else that a bathroom
might contain is optional. You'd
better not have: a blow dryer,
aerosol deodorant or a razor and
shaving cream.

On to the bedroom. (Oh
joy!) The bed must be on the
floor or on a loft (above your
attackers). Naturally you don’t
have enough storage space for
your things, regardless of how
little you own. One bureau with
your dyke paraphernalia — dis-
played on the top is allowed in
addition to whatever closets
your space comes with and as
many plastic milk crates and
cardboard boxes as you want. In
some circles it’s also OK to store
things wherever you happen to
drop them.

Decorating your room is
your picture gallery: pictures of
you and your (female) ex-lovers,
you as a child, your old maiden
aunts, family pictures of your
female ancestors as well as a

photo of any particular heroine
of yours, such as Adrienne Rich.
You have a bulletin board or
designated wall to tack up
announcements of women’s cul-

tural events, news clippings,
feminist postcards, etc.

Other decorations include
drawings (made by you if
possible), cunt art (I still choke
on that word but it’s very P.C.
here to reclaim it — trouble
is, I haven’t seen any proof that
it belonged to us in the first
place), crystals for your win-
dows, stars, moons, labyrinths,
and candles for spells, energy
saving and love making. Remem-
ber in all this it’s quantity not
quality that counts so stock up.
You must keep a journal.

The rest of the place, if you
have any more, can be covered
pretty quickly. It has a lot of
similarities to 60’s counter-
culture — only instead of anti-
war posters you have women’s
cultural events, Tee Corrinne’s
Sinister Wisdom poster, any of
the standard feminist fore-
mothers — Emma Goldman,
Sojourner Truth and the like,
strong looking mountain or
Third World women. Speaking
of foremothers, decorations
reclaiming your ethnic heritage
are required but only if it’s
non-western. If your heritage is
white, European, you may have
one or two Native American,
Spanish, or African articles and
there is no sign of your own
culture. In other words, you can

have an African carved figure
but not a little shepherdess from
the Black Forest.

You can have a small,
portable black and white TV,
but it must be kept out of sight;
good quality sports or camping
equipment but it should be well
used by now; you can admit to
having an iron but you can’t
admit to using it. Whatever your
“work" is — which may or may
not be the same thing as your
job — you may have the equip-
ment necessary to it: power
tools if you're a carpenter,
musical instruments, an electric
typewriter if you're a writer, a
manual one if you're not.
Fortunately, you are the one
who determines whether or not
you are a writer. Being an
engineer and having a home
computer would be highly sus-
pect.

The one exception to all
rules on P.C.-ness is your stereo.
This item is so essential that it
doesn’t matter how expensive it
is or in what politically incorrect
way you got it, no points will be
deducted. Your record collec-
tion, naturally, somewhat paral-
lels your book collection, name-
ly a good stock of womyn’s
music plus some leftovers. Whe-
ther these others include Johnny
Mathis or Barry Manilow
depends on your age and/or
recentness of conversion to the
path of true light.

Plants and animals are the
element of completion for any
P.C. dyke space but not if you
can't take care of them. Respect
for life takes precedence.

That’s about all the political
correctness I can stand for one
issue but someone else is wel-
come to provide the next
installment describing what the
well-dressed, politically correct
dyke will be wearing this year,
what her car looks like, what
kind of meetings she needs to go
to, etc. Keep in mind that these
directions apply only to Burling-
ton and environs. Different
communities may require other
modes of living. Consult your
local, radical feminist press for
details on how to think, act and
live in the community nearest
you.
