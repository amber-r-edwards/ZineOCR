“By 1984, the military
will have become a major
instrument for socialization...
assuming a large portion of the
role once dominated by the
family, the church, the school,
and the civilian work setting.”

Thomas Carr, former
Director of Defense
Education for the Dept.
of Defense

As the number of young
people in the United States
decreases and the demands for a
standby army increase, the mili-
tary is increasing its recruiting
activity in the nation’s schools.

This activity ranges from the

increased presence of military
recruiters in lunchrooms and
guidance counselors' offices, to a
revitalized JROTC, and the
militarization of school-
sponsored career days.

Several weeks ago, the Bur-
lington School Board voted 8 to
2 with 1 abstention to apply for
Navy JROTC to start Sept. 1982
in Burlington High School. The
program will eventually involve
100-150 kids, “1%” retired
military personnel, and $20,000
a year of Burlington taxpayers'
money. (The senior retired mili-
tary officer who will be selected
for the job will already be

receiving $20,000 in retirement
benefits; he will receive an
additional $10,000 from Bur-
lington taxpayers, and another
$10,000 from the Navy, making
his total income — through
‘double-dipping’ — $40,000, or
more than any other person
receives from the Burlington
School system!!)

Although JROTC went through
a decline during the War in
Vietnam, it has grown to the
point today where it is more
widespread than college level
ROTC. Some 180,000 male and
female students in over 1200
schools across the country parti-
cipate in the program. It was
recently made part of Essex
Junction’s curriculum, where to
all reports it is a great success.

What does it teach? Accord-
ing to a report prepared by the
Friends Peace Committee enti-
tled “High School Military
Recruiting,” “In the Navy
JROTC course, three classes per
week are devoted to academic
subjects including some coverage
of navigation and astronomy, as
well as political science, history
and interpersonal relationships.
Two class periods per week are
devoted to drills, commands
and ceremonies.” Schools that
have JROTC are required to

KEMP COMING

By Debora Beasley

Ex-quarterback and six-term
New York Congressman Jack
Kemp, jock hero for the right
wing, is tackling the country and
its people with his hard-hitting
scheme to build military forces,
while reducing service programs
at the expense of the health and
safety of our lives.

Kemp, co-author of the
Kemp-Roth tax bill, will be the
guest speaker at the Republican
State Annual Dinner, to be held
Friday, October 30 at Norwich
Military University Plumley
Auditorium in Northfield. A
6:00 reception and 7:30 dinner,
at which Kemp will speak, is
planned. A social hour for Kemp
is also planned at an as yet
unidentified location, according
to Republican Headquarters in
Montpelier. In 1980, National
Review referred to Kemp's tax
bill as the “centerpiece of
Reagan's presidential campaign.”

A day of demonstration will
be held, beginning at noon on
the Statehouse Lawn in Mont-
pelier with speeches, theatre and
songs to protest Kemp’s visit and
policies. A march is scheduled to
begin at 1:30 in downtown
Montpelier. At 4:30 car pools
will leave the Statehouse area to
drive to Plumley Auditorium to
demonstrate at the reception
beginning at 6:00.

Kemp’s supply side theory
of economics which calls for tax
rate reductions to increase
revenue, is based on the take
from the needy and give to the
greedy ethics of the Reagan
administration. This supply side
theory failed to honestly tell us
what we are to be supplied with.

We are being supplied with
massive cuts in human services,
primarily affecting women and
children, the elderly, people
with disabilities, Black and Third
World people, the working poor,
as more money is being supplied
to the military to produce
bombs. The Reagan-Kemp
domination philosophy further
allows for environmental regula-
tions to be reduced, thereby
raping, mutilating and exploiting
our Earth, just as men’s violence
and domination rape, mutilate
and exploit women. All levels of
violence rise, with increasing
pressure applied against women
and the poor, who are this
country’s majority. Men are
taking their anger, hate and
frustration out on women. Rape,
battering and murder of women
occur continuously. The military
escalates. Seeds of destruction
are reported by the media
without question or comment.
And our children learn these
messages and lessons.

So far in Vermont, the
consequences include: Norwich

offer the curriculum and text-
books furnished by the armed
forces.”

I’ve been able to look at
Books 1 and 2 of the Navy
Manual that will be used at
Burlington High School. There is
only one entry in the indexes of
the 2400-page books, on
Vietnam. The text reads:

American military personnel

began to help train the

Republic of (South) Viet-

nam armed forces in the

early 1960s. In 1964, two

U.S. destroyers were attack-

ed in the Gulf of Tonkin by

North Vietnamese torpedo

boats while on patrol in

international waters. The
attack was beaten off with
damage inflicted on the
enemy. The incident result-
ed in Congress passing the

“Tonkin Gulf Resolution”

which committed the Uni-

ted States to the undeclared

Vietnam War. All American

armed forces were locked in

combat in Vietnam against

Communist North Vietnam

and the South Vietnamese

Communist insurgents (Viet

Cong) until 1972 when a

treaty ended U.S. involve-

ment.”

I have two objections to this

paragraph. (1) Historians are
highly uncertain over what hap-
pened on the Gulf of Tonkin.
Some say there was no attack,
others that the two destroyers
Maddox and Joy nearly shot
each other up and in the con-
fusion called the incident an
attack by North Vietnamese
forces. Nobody contests, how-
ever, that our boats were operat-
ing at times within the 12 miles
limit claimed by the North
Vietnamese, and that points
along the North Vietnamese
coast had recently been shelled
by the South Vietnamese. (2)
U.S. involvement in Vietnam
ended in 1972??? To quote Paul
Joseph in Cracks in the Empire:
After the Peace Treaty of
1973, Nixon was able to
manipulate public opinion,

to convince many Ameri-
cans that the Vietnam War
was finally over. But there
was no diminution of the
anti-communist commit-
ment, only new and secret
means to secure it. Nixon
and Kissinger had no inten-
tion of permitting the Sai-
gon government to be over-
thrown or voted out of

office. When exposed, the
measures taken to maintain
secrecy — wiretaps, domes-

MAYOR'S TASK

A liberal mayor was elected
in Burlington, after a long-time
stand in that position by a very
conservative right-winger. Per-
haps this will give women in
Burlington a more legitimate
“in” to city politics, a stronger
piece of ground to stand on
while trying to effect change in
this community. Though it may
seem ludicrous to some of us,
the simple title, Mayor’s Task
Force on Women, gives the
group a stronger leg to stand on;
already, there is a wider variety
of women involved than usually
participates in women’s groups
in Burlington.

An example of what has
already been accomplished by
the Task Force is the September
19th Women’s Health Day. Con-
cerned that popular routes of
health care do not speak to the
needs of many women, especial-
ly those with lower incomes, the
Task Force conducted a free
clinic at the Burlington Commu-
nity Health Center. Women
practitioners and a woman doc-
tor provided gynecological
exams, breast exams and pap
smears. Sabrina Kemeny, the
coordinator of the event, said
the turn-out was great, about 40
women were seen, filling the

This is not to say that the maximum number of slots for

mayor himself is giving the Task
Force, or women in general, a
lot of support. Already, the Task
Force has had to push the mayor
on the issue of affirmative action
in city politics. The mayor's
agreement on this issue has not
yet been put to the test, but the
Task Force will be ready when
the time comes by having
compiled a resource list of
qualified women available for
positions in city government.

For the most part, the Task
Force is concerned with other
issues than those that directly
relate to city politics via govern-
ment. The Task Force has
divided itself into three sub-
committees, to deal with the
following issues: Health, Safety,

and Economics.

The Health Committee
plans on sponsoring future
Women’s Health Days and well-
child clinics as well.

The economic committee is
planning The Balancing Act: a
week-long event focusing on
women and work. There will be
a series of films shown at noon
in City Hall, and again in the
evenings at various community
centers such as North Gate and
The King Street Youth Center.
The wrap-up for the week will
be a day of workshops, including
topics such as Super-woman,
women and non-paying jobs,
sexual harassment on the job,
and how a socialist analysis of
the workforce in this country
often does not account for the
fact that many women work for

tic surveillance of war pro-
testers, security guards
directed against Nixon
opponents within the state
itself — backfired, produc-
ing a domestic crisis known as Watergate...

To my mind, the ROTC
manual papers over a painful
time in American history.
Describing the experience of
Vietnam in such a bland para-
graph denies the experiences of
thousands of Vietnam veterans
who can’t help but feel that the
country they fought for is still
trying to forget them. The whole
anti-communist slant of the
manual — where everything is
seen as Us and Them (the Third
World does not exist) is shot full
of right-wing paranoia.

So what can we do about it?
We can call our school board
members and talk with them
about it or come to the next
school board meeting Nov. 3,
7:30 p.m., Taft School. There
are four arguments that might be
especially effective: (1) It’s
educational worthlessness —
cadets are taught to memorize
facts — facts as the military
perceives them — rather than to
learn by inquiry, discovery and
critical thinking. (2) Unqualified

no pay.

One of the goals of the
safety committee is to establish
a whistle program for women in
Burlington, whereby whistles
will be freely distributed and a
code worked out that would
signal to others when a woman
is in danger. The Task Force also
hopes to sponsor free self-
defense classes for women and
begin running forums on Vio-
lence Against Women, including
Domestic Violence and Porno-
graphic Violence.

In terms of financial sup-
port from the city, the Task
Force will have to wait and see
what comes after the Bloc grant
(Federal money) proposals are
reviewed. The Task Force is
already committed to seeing that
the Women’s Rape Crisis Center
and Women Helping Battered
Women receive funds. THE hope
is that both groups will receive
money for their hotlines, that
the city will provide a building
for a battered women’s shelter
and that funds will be provided

to hire a staff person for
Women’s Rape Crisis Center.
For the most part, the

effects of the Task Force remain
to be seen. The group will
continually be open to new
members and ideas and plans to
be around for a long time no
matter who the mayor is.
