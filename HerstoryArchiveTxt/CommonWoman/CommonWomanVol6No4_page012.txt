Anarchism & Other Essays,  
Emma Goldman, Includes a  
biographic sketch by Hippolyte  
Havel.

Some of the essays are: Prisons,  
A Social Crime and Failure; Patrio-  
tism, A Menace to Liberty (both  
accurate observations); The Traffic in  
Women; Woman Suffrage (a critical  
essay); Marriage and Love (only  
one of which Emma supported);  
The Tragedy of Woman's Eman-  
cipation (Is being equal to men  
in a man’s world liberatory? or  
detrimental?); The Psychology of  
Political Violence (no folks, all  

anarchists aren't assassins); and five  

others. Problems with the book? Lots  
of male “generic” gender-words, and  
the racist use of “darkness” asso-  
ciated with evil images. Dept. His-  
tory, Dover Publications, Inc., 180

Ancient Mirrors of Womanhood,  
Merlin Stone.

Two volumes on Goddess and  
Heroine Heritage, this book includes  
gleanings of tales and rituals from a  
diversity of often brief, fragmentary  
or obscure texts, parchments and  
ethnological studies. The important  
thing about this book is that it  
covers many areas of the world  
rather than focusing on European  
histories and Western “civilization”  
only. Sections in the book include  

Chinese, Japanese, Celtic, Greek,  
Semitic, African, Indian, Oceanic,  
Anatolian, Egyptian, Scandinavian,  

Sumerian and Northern, Middle and  
Southern Native American. The pre-  
face and introduction speak about  
the different connotations and result-  
ing attitudes that the words “reli-  
gion” and “mythology” conjure up,  
and the racial (as well as gender) bias  
in the literal invisibility, and resulting  
ignorance, of oral traditions. New

The Cancer Journals, Audre  
Lorde, Spinsters Ink, Argyle,  
N.Y.

“I am a post-mastectomy  
woman who believes our feelings  
need voice in order to be recognized,  
respected, and of use.” Intimately  
open and vulnerable, Lorde shares  
her journal entries, her memories and  
her intense clarity as she writes to  
break the silence that keeps us  
powerless and separate in our fear —  
all our fears — of cancer and death. A  
poet, Audre Lorde tells a passionate  
and true story, and gives tremendous  
love and strength in her words. It  
“should be read by every woman  
who has a breast, and especially by  
those who do not.”

Among Women, Louise Berni-  
kow, Harper Colophon Books,  
New York, 1980 (paperback)  
Looks at the history of litera-  
ture, myths and friendship, revealing  
the ways in which women have been  
left out/neglected/discouraged/mis-  
interpreted by men. But this book is  
not negative: it is part of a new kind  
of women’s writing. It goes on to  
discuss what women have accom-  

plished, can accomplish — their  
friendships, relations with other  
women... mothers, sisters. I’m still  

reading it and highly recommend it  
to anyone who is consumed by an  
interest to “get on” with our own  
history, literature and lives. (This is  
also part of new writing because,  
although researched and serious, it is  
wonderfully readable.)

Summer Reading List

In the Name of Love, Jill  
Treedie, (hard-cover), 1979,  
Pantheon Books, N.Y. (probably  
have to order it)

By a British writer, this is clear,  
well-written and extensively  
researched. The history of hetero-  
sexual love and love/family relation-  
ships is interpreted with a feminist  
view. Especially interesting discussion  
of mother-daughter patterns. Histori-  

cal, societal and psychological  
oppression of women is firmly  
traced.

Linda C.

Desert of the Heart, Jane Rule  
(out in paperback — but may  
have to order it)

A novel of love between women  
where the story is unexploitative,  
natural. It takes place in Las Vegas;  
in a rooming house for about-to-  
divorcees, in the casinos, in the  
desert. Conflicts of love, age differ-  
ences, romantic ideals; of work, art,  
productivity; of the natural landscape  
and people's interference — are all  
treated. Realistic and well-written,  
especially the casino scenes.

Linda C.

Final Payments and The Com-  
pany of Women, Mary Gordon  
(both out in paperback)  

Mary Gordon is a fine  
writer. For any women brought  
up Catholic, both books uncover the  
layers of Catholic social systems/  
guilt/dependence/claustrophobia of a  
woman in the Catholic system. Final  
Payments has a perceptive treatment  
of the friendship between three  
women.

Woman and Nature, Susan Griffin,  
Harper and Row

This is a ground-breaking, germinal  
book. Griffin does not so much  
show the woman/nature connection  
as allow us to feel it. She documents  
the concurrent raping of women and  
the Earth. The linking of earthy,  
carnal, woman and evil by pat-  

riarchy is a detriment to life and the  

roaring inside her (the book's sub-  
title) is the life force ready to erupt.  
A prose poem, a polemic, a new  
form, a beautiful, powerful voice.  
Necessary.

Ain't Nowhere We Can Run,  
Susan Koen and Nina Swain.  
Named from Holly Near lyrics,  
this is a Handbook for Women on the  
Nuclear Mentality. The best anti-  
nuclear book with a clearly feminist  
perspective, this book is written  
by Vermont women and funded  
in part by a Haymarket Grant. It  
clearly outlines links between the  
Patriarchy and the Nuclear Mentality,  
and proposes Eco-Feminism as the  
alternative vision to the death cul-  
ture. Its focus is on the effects of  
nuclear development on women and  
it talks about how women are speak-  
ing out against nuclear madness, and  
how other women can join them.  
Problems? The illustrations of  
women by Marcia Huyette are pretty  

stereotyped/objectifying... and all  
white. WAND, Box 421, Norwich,

We Didn't Have Much/But We  
Sure Had Plenty, Stories of  
Rural Women. Sherry Thomas,  
Anchor Books/Doubleday,

In the first person these tales are  
intimate portraits of rural womyn of  
different age and class backgrounds  
who were visited by the author in  
her attempt to include the past, the  
“other women” in her own reality of  
rural womyn’s culture. The author of  
“Country Women” (magazine),  
Sherry traveled across the country  
many times over the ten years of this  
project, talking to and recording  
these amazing stories. They're enter-  
taining and fun, a proud and inspiring  
herstory of some of the women who  
have come before us.

No More Masks, edited by  
Florence Howe and Ellen Bass  
(poetry anthology).  
I don’t like anthologies much as  
a rule, but this one is a pretty good  
anthology of twentieth century U.S.  
women poets. The book, titled after  
a line from a Muriel Rukeyser poem,  
is divided into three sections, mostly  
by the age of the poets, to try to  
point out changing styles and focus  
in poetry over time. Part One is titled  
from an Amy Lowell poem, “...we’re  
a queer lot/We women who write  
poetry.”; the second after Adrienne  
Rich's poem/book title “The Will to  
Change;” and the third after a Jean  
Tepperman poem, “We are scream-  
ing/we are flying/laughing, and won’t  
stop.” I particularly like the dedica-  
tion: “to our sisters/in jail/under-  
ground/at war/whose lives are their  
poems.” Problems? The introduction  
is too literary in a lofty, scholarly  
sort of way. The intro. shallowly  
discusses the influence of black  
poets on poetry today, but no  
mention at all is made of native  
American, Semitic or Asian poe-  
try, even though the book boasts  
of being a “truly non-segregated”  
anthology.

This Bridge Called My Back,  
Writings by Radical Women of  
Color. Editors Cherrie Moraga,  
Gloria Anzaldua, with foreword  
by Toni Cade Bambara. Perse-  
phone Press, Watertown, Ma.  
This is the most important and  
exciting book I’ve read in years.  
Personal stories of pain and pride  
that touch me and had me in tears  
and laughter and understanding. An  
essential book, a bridge that chal-  

lenges and names racism... in the  
world, and especially among  
women... and that celebrates ethnic  

pride.

Gyn/Ecology, Mary Daly, Bea-  
con Press

Daly, schooled in Catholic theo-  
logy, has really seen through the  
patriarchal myth-making system. Her  
antecedents are Virginia Woolf and  
Matilda Joslyn Gage but no one has  
made more sense out of the male  
atrocity system. Daly uses words in a  
way that changes them forever  

for us and she has seen the lies  
and shallowness of patriarchy and we  
too grasp the shakiness of its founda-  
tions. She explicates the journey of  
feminists to our own radical selves  
and celebrates the spark of female  
friendship. Essential.

Silences, Tillie Olsen (out in  

paperback)  
A serious, sad, disturbing book  
of why writers don’t write, why  
creativity is stifled so often. With  
quotes from other writers that Tillie  
Olsen had been collecting for years  
and years. Much attention to the  
silence of women as writers, to the  
effects of financial comfort and to  
“myths” about artistic tempera-  
ments.

Linda C.

The Vagabond, Colette, Farrar,  
Straus and Giroux, N.Y. (just  
out in paperback), Ballantine,  
$2.50.  
All of Colette, who lived from  
1873 to 1954, is wonderful. This is a  
novel of a woman who finds herself  
rejecting conventional alternatives  
in her life. Colette is an exceptional  
storyteller and her style is often a  
unique, feminine internalized vision.  
Her journals are also great reading.  
Linda C.

S.C.U.M. Manifesto,  
Solanas, Olympia Press  
SCUM stands for the Society  
for Cutting Up Men and it is one of  
the most extreme and radical pieces  
of writing to come out of the  
women’s movement. Written in 1967  
by the woman who shot Andy  
Warhol. Especially wonderful is the  
section on Great Art, Ugliness and  
Boringness. Sample Solanas: “A  
society made by and for creatures  
who — because of an extremely  
limited range of feeling — when they  
aren’t grim and depressing, as utter  
bores can only be, when not grim  
and depressing, an utter bore.”  

Lifetime Guarantee, Alice Bloch,  
Persephone Press.

The personal story of a Lesbian,  
Jewish woman faced with the death,  
at 20, of her sister. Vulnerable and  
open, the author explores the intense  
bond between sisters, and powerfully  
recreates and examines the painful  
events of death, loss and separation —  
all against the background of the  
“ordinary” family dynamics a Les-  
bian woman endures.

Lynn V.

Surpassing the Love of Men,  
Lillian Faderman, Morrow Quill  
This is a history of lesbianism. It  
is subtitled Romantic Friendship and  
Love Between Women from the  
Renaissance to the Present and  
includes friendships that may not  
have been sexual because of the  
context of the times and the general  
repression of female sexuality. She  
shows how changing views of sexual-  
ity affected society’s perception of  
women’s friendship, and traces the  
development of lesbianism to the  
present day where it combines with  
feminism and is the beginning of  
self-definition. This is a joy to  
read.

Woman, Church and State,  
Matilda Joslyn Gage, Perse-  
phone Press  
What you didn’t learn in world  
history. This book by a nineteenth  
century feminist, friend of Stanton  
and Anthony, has been suppressed  
since its writing until three years ago  
when Persephone released it. A  
feminist world herstory, I am furious  
at its suppression; had we learned this  
in high school life would be quite  
different. She does an especially good  
job of tracing the history of law  
from canon to common, to constitu-  
tional with the thread of woman-  
hating connecting them all. Also the  
introductory essay on Gage as a  
lesser-known figure (because she was  
more radical) in the 19th century  
women’s movement is important  
reading.

Everything Makes a Circle,  
(songbook) by Joni AvRutick  
and Etana Finkler,

A great songbook for kids  
written from real experience, hopes  
and fears. Really wonderful non-  
sexist, non-racist illustrations. Both  
fun/funny and serious lyrics with  
creative tunes. Tapes available also.

REWEAVING  
THE WEB:

Review by Paij Wadley-Bailey

I would like to share a  
preview of Reweaving the Web  
of Life: Feminism and Non-  
violence, published by New  
Society Publishers and coming  
out early March.

Some of the contributors to  
the book come most strongly  
from a feminist perspective.  
Others come more from a  
pacifist perspective, and are  
still struggling with the implica-  
tions of feminism. According to  
Pam McAllister, editor of this  
anthology, “In spite of the  
variations the writers embrace  
both feminism and nonviolence  
in a way which transforms both,  
and the differences only add  
complexity and value to the  
pattern they weave.”

St. Michael's College has  
recently published Toward a  
Feminist Analysis: Proceedings  
of the Women and Society  
Symposium, edited by Carey  
Kaplan and Buff Lindau. Select-  
ing from among some 150 essays  
presented at the March 1979  
Women & Society Symposium,  
the editors of Toward a Feminist  
Analysis have collected 13 of the  
best pieces submitted for consi-  
deration. Written from various  
perspectives on feminism, the  
essays cover all the major  
academic disciplines — the arts,  
the sciences and the social  
sciences. A limited number of  
copies of the book remain for  
sale to the public through the  
SMC Office of Public Informa-  
tion.

The book is structured in  
two parts. The first part deals  
primarily with theory. The  
writers explore various ideas  
about the revolutionary im-  
plications of combining femin-  
ism and nonviolence and address  
such issues as masculinity and  
war, women’s commitment to  
peace, patriarchal power and  
feminist resistance, sexism in the  
peace movement and feminist  
distrust of traditional nonviolent  
theory.
