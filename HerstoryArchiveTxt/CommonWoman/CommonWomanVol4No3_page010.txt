Holly Near wants to appear  
on the Johnny Carson show —  
what does that mean, how is it  
affecting us? For many people,  
this is a time again to build and  
work in coalitions to struggle for  
change. Sometimes this involves  
compromises; often our differ-  
ent tactics obscure similar goals.  
Holly, in speaking to and reach-  
ing our sisters, mothers and  
neighbors, is doing something  
many of us haven't been able to,  
and we appreciate her for it. But  
some of us feel a loss as well; the  
umph, for us, is gone.  

Yes, there were some real  
powerful moments in the con-  
cert (sponsored by the Vermont  
Public Interest Group and Every-  
woman's Place in March at the  
Flynn Theatre, Burlington).  
Holly Near does continue to  
write songs that become trea-  
sures; she leaves us with songs to  
sing to empower us, to express  
our rage as well as our soft love  
and need.  

For us, the most powerful  
and touching songs were “Sit  
With Me,” “Golden Threads”  
and “People Killing People.”  
Dealing with the deep emotions  
of feeling overwhelmed, tired  
and afraid of the world strains,  
the first song was intensely  
beautiful and painful and Holly  
was perhaps more open and  
vulnerable as she sang this than  
at any other point. She felt real;  
the experience of needing some-  
one to let you be a mess, to be  
needy and tired, to hold you and  
not themselves become over-  
whelmed with your pain, is  
often our need, too, and hearing  
that sung and understood was an  
important connection. It was  
clear that she FELT that song,  
and that made it powerful.  
Voicing the complications of  
attractions, jealousies and need  
for securities within our differ-  
ent kinds of lesbian relation-  
ships, Holly touched many of us  
and again made herself vulner-  
able as well as “out” as a lesbian  
as she sang “Golden Threads.”  
And the third, “People Killing

People,” I have heard many  
times since the concert; people,  
especially the children, hum the  
chorus, and it helps me realize  
and appreciate the impact, the  
magnetic quality of some of her  
political songs. Yes, for sure,  
there were some intense  
moments in the concert...  

But not as many moments  
as I remember from past con-  
certs, the intensity wasn’t as  
sustained, the energy more mel-  
low. We have heard this from  
many people, felt it ourselves; I  
have tried to be pragmatic about  
it, but I feel sad. Are we, the  
audience, equally responsible?  
Were we looking to her to be a  
stimulant, a vitamin in this time  
of feeling broken by the world  
scene? Could she need that from  
us, the audience? Were we  
being passive passengers, or does  
she have, as performer, the  
responsibility to move us  
beyond our mood? Do we want  
to give her (anyone) that star  
power?  

Holly has decided that her  
work is as a cultural worker, as a  
bridge between alternative cul-  
ture and politics and mainstream  
America. She is trying to make  
the connections between nuclear  
power, war, rape, women’s  
issues, exploitation of the work-  
ing classes and of third world  
countries, and she’s trying to put  
it out in a way that will be heard  
by other than “alternative poli-  
tical people.” Her concert is her  
work, her approach is all part of  
her outreach. Is she successful?  
Comments ranged from “won-  
derful” to “bored.” Many peo-  
ple were moved, excited, felt  
opened and stimulated. In reach-  
ing and touching these people  
she was successful.  

But we felt a certain kind of  
coolness in her passion. We miss  
(with the exception of the songs  
we mentioned) the deep, moving  
emotion and commitment (and  
this is how we're defining  
passion) in her voice. For the  
most part we were not moved,  
or deeply enough touched. For  
sure we felt entertained, and we

certainly enjoyed her concert.  
But we were not shaken.  

In the past, I (Lynn) have  
felt that jolt, that strong moving  
connection with her music that I  
miss now. Am I in a different  
place, or is she? Is her power/  
passion less, or do I need more?  
Her music has always been too  
“nice” for me (Etana); yet I still  
love, respect and value the work  
she’s doing. I don’t criticize the  
“niceness” or downplay of “gut  
feeling” as her personal fault,  
but I see it as a shortcoming/  
result of being middle-class.  
In talking about it, we  
thought that her focus on  
touring and album distribution  
(yes, outreach) is taking her too  
far from the day to day work on  
the issues of which she sings.  
Perhaps this accounts for the  
lessening of emotional commit-  
ment, or passion, in many of her  
songs. She is working to make  
radical politics acceptable to a  
broad range of people. Her  
professional slickness is part of  
that attempt. The question is,  
will we gain more from her  
outreach in the long run, or feel  
abandoned by the resultant  
dilution of her/our message?  

In the meantime, she is an  
ally, a strong political woman,  
visible and “out” as a lesbian on  
stage, and in all of this she is  
special. If you, personally, were  
disappointed in her concert,  
remember that future concerts  
would be a safe, good place to  
bring (or send) a relative, friend  
or neighbor.

Holly in N.H.  

By Barbara Hirschfeld  

One-and-a-half years ago,  
after a concert at UNH of all  
places, I approached Holly Near  
and asked her to sing a song  
about relationships. She said,  
“Oh, I don’t have time to spend  
on relationships, I’m too busy  
working on other things,” to  
which I could only press my lips  
and mutter, “Oh.” Taken aback  
is the term, I believe.  

She was intent, and very  
tired, much like a crusader who  
has been holding the flag up too  
long, so that the blood had  
drained from her uplifted arms  
and the heroic smile had frozen  
on her face. Now she returns  
east with a bevy of songs about  
relationships. She is relaxed, she  
smiles and jokes easily, and once  
again she applies her principles  
to the task: “... You are not, you  
are not my enemy.”  
+. To continue on that theme,  
I have to speak about the way  
the concert in Lebanon, N.H.,  
had been organized. A coalition of  
women’s support services from  
Concord, N.H., to the Northeast  
Queendom sponsored Holly  
Near this time. None of the  
women in charge were from the  
upper valley, Lebanon area. The  
communications stunk, to be  
blunt. Tickets were very hard to  
get for people living in and  
around Lebanon, and some of us  
worried that the disorganization  
that we felt would be reflected  
in the production of the concert.  

Well, we were wrong. The  
concert went so smoothly and  
Holly was very relaxed thanks to  
everything being in order when  
she arrived, and I am relieved  
and glad that I didn't have to do  
anything but enjoy it.  

I want to thank the women  
who once again put the Lebanon  
Opera House on the women’s  
music circuit map. You are not  
my enemy, but please let's make  
use of these concerts to enlarge  
and intensify our network. We  
do not want to be territorial; we  
are part of one huge movement.  
But we also do not want to be  
ignored. “I am writing this for  
Commonwoman so that we may  
know each other better.
