EATING WITH

+ CHILDREN x

By Connie Wilson

How do you know if your
child is eating enough? Do
children tease for food when
they want attention? Should
dessert be a reward for eating a
meal? Is it all right to give in to a
child’s demands for a cookie to
avoid a power struggle? These
are some of the questions which
came up when parents at Ethan
Allen Child Care Center got
together for a free pizza dinner
and discussion group on “Eating
with Children” November 10.

As you can imagine, no
simple or universal solutions
were available. However, parents
found that discussing common
issues was supportive in itself,
and were able to offer each
other suggestions from their own
experience. It was helpful to
parents to think about no one
approach being right for every
parent and child, as well as the
idea of developing trust in a
child's innate sense of feeding
her/himself. In an experiment
done in the 1940s, Dr. Clara
Davis allowed young children
between the ages of six months
and one year to choose their
own food from a wide assort-
ment of wholesome foods, with
no intervention from adults. A
nurse was allowed to assist the
child only when s/he had already
tried to make contact with the
food of her/his choice. Over a
period of time (not within one
meal or one day), each child
selected a well-balanced diet,
often eating a specific food
which her/his body had a need
for on a particular day, and then
making up for any resulting
deficiencies the next day. The
experiment was later conducted
with older children with similar
results. However, we all know
the pressures which children face
from peers and the media which
make such pure results impossi-
ble in the real world.

The fact is, though, that if
parents can remove themselves
and their anxieties from the
child’s gene, fewer food prob-
lems will be created. Power
struggles which often carry over
from or into other parts of the
parent/child relationship only
create negative associations with
certain foods in particular and
eating in general. It is the
parent’s job to provide the food;
it is the child’s job to eat it.

Parent discussion groups are
held once a month at Ethan
Allen Child Care Center. For

VIA WILL RUN?

By Kathleen Moore

Susan Via, Chittenden
County state's attorney, said Nov.
17 at a session of the Church Street
Center symposium “Women and
Work” that she “is definitely
going to run” for office as
Chittenden County state’s attor-
ney.

Mark Keller, the present
Chittenden County state’s attor-
ney, plans to return to private
practice in Burlington after his
term in office is up. His term
expires in February of 1983.

Via graduated with honors
from Columbia University Law
School in 1976. She worked as a
trial attorney in Denver and
Dallas, and worked for the Equal
Opportunity Employment Com-
mission.

She recently argued for the
constitutionality of Vermont's
1977 rape shield law before the
Vermont Supreme Court. The
court upheld the law. Via said
the 1977 law “brings Vermont
into line with almost every other
state.”

Prior to 1977, Vermont's
rape law limited the definition
of rape to male-female inter-
course without the woman's
consent. The 1977 sexual assault
statute does not restrict rape to
that definition. The victim may
be either male or female, and the
attacker may be either male or
female. A woman's past sexual
conduct is now not admissible as
evidence in trial except under
certain limited circumstances.

Via said her victory in argu-
ing for the law’s constitutionality
was probably the high point in
her career so far.

She said she plans to run as
a Democrat.

On October 30, 35 women
and children and a handful of
men gathered on the statehouse
lawn in Montpelier for what
appears to be just one of many
yet-to-come demonstrations
against Ray-gun and his cronies.
This particular demonstration
was directed against Jack Kemp,
former quarterback (remember
the last ex-football player we
had leading the country — Ford??!!)
and current congressman of the
right from New York. Kemp, co-author of the
Kemp Roth tax bill, and person-
ally responsible for the $36
billion cuts to people in human
service programs, was the invited
guest and speaker for the Repub-
lican fund-raising dinner held,
appropriately, at Norwich Mili-
tary Academy.

Ever ignorant and uncaring
of their hypocrisy calling for
sacrifices by “the common peo-
ple,” the Republicans charged
$65 per plate (scaled to $20 for
students) for the opportunity to
hear Kemp talk at them. No one
even had the decency to be
embarrassed or shocked, or
pretend to be, at the cost as
they arrived at the military
academy decked out in their
best suits, dresses, and driving
their fancy cars. They were
excited, pleased to be able to be
part of this select group. After
all, as a spokeswoman at Repub-
lican headquarters told me,
Kemp is a great circuit speaker,
with a “machine gun, rapid fire
delivery”!!!

KUTS

By Deane Brittingham,
Kris Drumm and
Deborah Peastey

At the statehouse, women
spoke of the many issues affect-
ing us today: violence against
women, sexism, racism, clas-
sism, militarism, and their ever-
increasing presence in our lives.
We sang, chanted and talked
with passers-by about Kemp and
the right wing, receiving much
support for our actions in this
process. Marching through the
streets of Montpelier we were
joined by the ever diligent
Montpelier police department,
and their trained German shep-
herd. The night before the
demonstration, at the Mont-
pelier City Council meeting,
Police Chief Hoyt, reading from
our flyer that we were to be
“screaming, raging, protesting”
suggested that perhaps more was
intended to take place during
the day. When I asked why we
were being pursued and harassed
by the police and dog, I was told
“for your protection.” Sound fami-
liar? It’s always for our own
good according to the boys,
along with national security and
defense of our land!

Our march was peaceful as
we walked up and down the
main streets. Stopping outside of
Republican headquarters in the
Tavern Motor Inn, we chanted
louder in order to be heard
inside. Blocked from entering by
manager Howard Knapp, a
woman held the door open and
was forcibly pushed by Knapp,
who also insulted us and our
actions. In what was later to
receive much press attention, she
spit at Knapp in anger and in
defense of his using physical
force against her. The event was
witnessed by Neil Davis of the
Free Press (ironic title), all of it
except Knapp's pushing her, that
is. How convenient?! In his
subsequent “reporting” Davis
never questions Knapp’s using
physical force, and in fact,
printed Knapp’s denial, even
though it was witnessed by
about 20 of the demonstrators.
So as usual, the issue became a
woman’s reaction instead of the
man’s action.

Regrouping later that night
at Norwich, our presence and
slogans greeted a majority of the
700 Republican attendees, as
MPs provided escorts, parking
services and no doubt protection
to them.

Informed that Kemp was to
hold a press conference, two of
us left the group to join the
press inside, causing a great
flurry for a number of the
press who recognized us as being
from “the other side.” Kemp
entered the room proceeded by
an aide smugly tossing a foot-

SUFFRAGE POSTERS

“What's sauce for the gan-
der is sauce for the goose.”
“Votes for Women, Wanted
Everywhere.” “Women need the
vote, only those who elect
Parliament have power to make
it serve them.” These are the
messages on some of the four
dozen posters from the English
women’s suffrage movement on
exhibition at the Municipal Art
Gallery, City Hall, Burlington.
The posters are from the collec-
tion of the Schlesinger Library
at Radcliffe College and former-
ly belonged to the California
suffragist, Alice Park. Mary
Winsor, the Philadelphia suffra-
gist (and cousin of the founder
of the Mary Winsor School),
bought them from Mrs. Park in
1950 for $20 and donated them
to the Schlesinger Library.

Although the Library’s
collections emphasize women in
America, these English posters
are useful because of the many
connections between the English
and American women suffrage
movements. For instance, the
fate Alice Paul and some of her
colleagues in the Congressional
Union learned their militant
tactics from the Pankhursts and
their allies in London. These
were the women who chained
themselves to the White House
fence, burned President Wilson's
speeches, and sometimes landed
in jail. They were also responsi-
ble for founding the National
Women's Party, which initiated
and has kept alive for the last 58
years the idea of the Equal
Rights Amendment.

Some of these posters are
fine examples of poster art — at
least one is a hand-colored
printer's proof. But, because
many were printed on relatively
poor paper, and because of their
age and length of storage under
less than ideal conditions, most
of them were badly in need of
restoration. With the help of a
grant from the Massachusetts
Council on the Arts and Human-
ities, 45 posters were restored in
the paper conservation depart-
ment of Harvard University’s
Fogg Museum during the sum-
mer of 1978. They were cleaned,
mended and lined as necessary,
and encased in mylar envelopes
for safe handling and storage,
and easy display.

This exhibition has been
made possible by the Visual Arts
Touring Program of the New
England Foundation for the
Arts. The exhibition will be on
display from Dec. 12th between
8 and 5. For more information

Mayor's Council on the Arts and
Culture.
