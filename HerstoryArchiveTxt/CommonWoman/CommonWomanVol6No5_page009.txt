On the night of Yom Kippur

you gathered the women and sang Kol Nidre
your spirit that belonged to another world,
the world of art and dreams and music,

still alive and helping others find strength.

It was your nature.

SEPTEMBER, 1982

When someone offered you a chance to escape

you said, “no” — I won't go without my sister-in-law, my aunt,
and my girlfriend

in so doing, against all odds, you saved them all.

Henia

woman of deep melancholy eyes

How afraid I was of your pain

How much you needed me

I was life to you

I was joy to you

I was proof of your victory over Hitler

I was afraid

I was so afraid of you

and how much you looked to me for nourishment

I was just a little baby

and your hunger went far beyond anything I could do

You needed to love and be loved with a desperation that
suffocated me

and so I grew

I grew walls to keep out the love that frightened me

and I grew horns to match yours as we locked in battle
to match the anger that would have been

suicide had you shown it back then

you saw my anger as the Nazi monster

with which you had to plead for life

HENIA No I am your daughter
HENIA FLINT daughter of your own flesh
HENIA FLINT GOTTLIEB I am not the enemy
HENIA FLINT GOTTLIEB GOODMAN I do not wish you were dead
HENIA
You were afraid
daughter of Esther afraid of losing me
daughter of Manes no place away from you was safe enough for your child

no place was safe
you were afraid of losing me
through my silence and the ever-growing gap between us
yes I rebelled
I rebelled against anything that had to do with you
I rebelled against being a Jew
I rebelled against being a pianist
I rebelled against being manipulated into guilt because of your
pain
But still, I thought I was to blame
And I felt like a monster for hurting someone
who had already suffered so much.

From a family of fifty
only you have survived
thirty-five years of memories and nightmares

each memory a tear a tightening in your chest

twenty-five years old and you watched your father beat

twenty-five years old and you tried to save him who is now
insane,

out of his mind, yet you remained in yours

How? How did you survive?

twenty-seven years old and you carried the music of Chopin

under your arm to Auschwitz

twenty-seven years old, Dr. Mengele pointed his finger,

and you watched your mother walk the other way and
disappear forever

Tell me! How did you survive?
