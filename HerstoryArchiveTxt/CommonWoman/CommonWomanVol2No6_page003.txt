Dowry Murders in India

(from Working Feminist News Service)

On June 12, 1979, a demon-
stration in New Delhi, India,
demanded an end to murder by
fire of brides because of dowry.
At least five young women
whose fathers failed to pay the
full bride-price (dowry) after the
weddings have been doused
with inflammables and set afire
as a result of their father’s
failure to pay up. Protesters
carried placards saying: “Arrest
Tavinder’s murderers” and “The
death of even one more girl will
not be tolerated.” The demon-
stration was called by Nari
Raksha Samiti, New Delhi's
battered women’s shelter. Both
men and women participated. A
delegation of five women later
presented a memorandum to the
home minister, H. M. Patel,

demanding that payment for

Dear Renee, Joknee & the
Women's House of Transition,

We agree with your position
that our culture allows and
perpetuates violence and oppres-
sion against women. We have
experienced these situations
firsthand. We too have been
victims. We sympathize with
your cause. We are aware of the
great amounts of effort and
energy that are put out by your
group on behalf of battered
women.

We apologize for our incom-
plete communication about the
shooting and are sorry that it
left you feeling “used;” that was
not our intent. When doing
research for a public affairs/in-
formation show of this type, it is
necessary to speak with as many
people who are involved and
elicit as much information as
possible. While all meetings of
this type are invaluable to the
completed project, it is imprac-
tical to videotape each inter-
view. The preliminary meeting
with the Women’s House of
Transition members was no
exception. Although you may
take issue with our decision to
use the Brattleboro facility as
opposed to yours as an example

demand for dowries be made a
cognizable offense, and imme-
diate police action be taken
when dowry complaints are
registered. The women further
demanded that “those found
guilty in cases of burning of
women should not be given bail
when their guilt is established”
and urged the harshest possible
sentences. They further demand
that the full dowry of the
murdered girl be returned to the
parents.

Payment or receipt of dow-
ries was outlawed in India in
1961, but the Dowry Prohibi-
tion Act has signally failed to
achieve its purpose, the news
reports state. Fathers still give
dowries “to buy happiness for
their daughters,” the reports
continue, “increasing his own

of a safe house, you should not
underestimate the value of your
participation in our project.

There were many factors
which entered into our decision.
The pressures of time and
money (i.e., scheduling, rentals
of equipment, crew expenses,
tape stock and more) left us
with an extremely tight schedule
and few options for shooting
duplicated situations. In making
the decision to shoot in Brattle-
boro as opposed to your facility,
several factors came into play.
From a state-wide perspective,
the Brattleboro Women’s Crisis
Center is well established and
well funded. They have built
extremely good rapport and
reputation both locally and
around the state. It was impor-
tant for us to show this positive
situation to a skeptical viewing
audience. You need to take
responsibility for the fact that
your organization’s controversial

politics undermines your posi-
tion in the community, which
ultimately depletes your
strength in dealing not only with
battered women, but social
services agencies at local and
state levels. This is not a criti-
cism of your work or your

debts in the bargain.” Well-to-do
grooms can expect one lakh
($12,000); business executives
rank second in “value,” engin-
eers and doctors just lower
on the scale. All men at these
economic levels can expect a car,
refrigerator and television, in
addition. A peon or clerk can
demand a bicycle, transistor
and/or wristwatch. A scooter is
a common demand at the middle
level. Even the matriarchal Nairs
of Kerala have begun to demand
dowries and the Muslims now
make the demand in disguised
form.

News reports of these tragic
events were sent to Working
Feminists by Ellen Jane Franklin
of Winnipeg, Canada, who is
currently traveling in Asia.

politics, but rather an assessment
of the public’s reaction to your
organization's profile.

You have justification to be
offended by decisions based on
“rumor,” yet need to ask
yourselves why your organiza-
tion's goals have been misunder-
stood. You also need to find
more viable ways of clarifying
your position to the community.
Although you may have seen our
show as a way of accomplishing
this, as we said before, we did
not want to risk diffusing the
overall impact of the show by
serving your political needs.

We cannot afford to pay for
your time, but we would be glad
to include an accounting of it as
in-kind services in our final
report.

Because we are committed
to changing many of the same
injustices inflicted upon women,
we would welcome an opportu-
nity to meet with you to discuss
ways in which your organization
can increase community support
and strengthen communication
with other people and agencies.

Sincerely,
Marcia A. Marshall &
Jane Kast
