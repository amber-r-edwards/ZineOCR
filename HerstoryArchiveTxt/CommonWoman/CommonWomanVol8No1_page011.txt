Visions Airy

We want to be held

behold  
be  
hold  

Not  

Be held-on-to  

Not  

Hold-on-to  

(except for this ever evolving dream)  

Not being held down or holding down  
To be held  
To behold  
To be  
To hold

At 190  

Such graceful arches  
laid like concrete  
upon earth bones  
meant to be lighter,  
freer,  

a weight held erect  
and unyielding  

to slim signs  

and slogans.  

Oh yes, I’m heavy  
with issues begun  
before my birth  

and long before yours.  

You say,  

“Lose sixty pounds,  

you'll feel so much better,  

you'll look like Marilyn Monroe.”  

Do I see myself  
in the mirror of your eyes?  

No, I see myself  
sinking heavy  

into the dirt  

of the earth herself,  
pulled by the gravity  
of earth events  
political beyond belief.  

And my weight,  

not a sign of beauty  

and of health,  

but a message  

of a sickness,  

an illness begun  

long before you  

and your helpful advice.

POETRY  

I rose out of dreams this morning  
with my hands between my legs  
and your name rolled off my tongue  
even before the night’s residues  

had fallen from my body.  

We are happy, strong,  
you are not gone for long,  
still, I see your room  

quiet  

and I imagine you in your hammock  
singing with a rough voice  
that brushes like strong fingers  
my nipples, my stomach,  
my thighs, my spirit,  
me  
who loves your laughter  
and the warmth and conviction  
of your flannel hug.  
—Anne Martyn  

¿Que tan lejos?  

if I could drive that far  
la tia Elda would give me  
cafe con leche  
whatever I want to eat  
siempre me escucha horas enteras  
however often she has heard it all before  
hurrying mientras tanto to offer  
un par de huevitos no más  
entonces pan dulce  
she’s so sure I need food  
pero ay niña  
arroz con pollo would take no time at all  
and there’s beer in the fridge  
I always say no tia de veras  
I’m not hungry  
con el cafe me basta  
I just want to sit still  
the breeze comes in the window all afternoon  
half-singing the notes of an old tune  
de un camino muy largo  
carrying the smell of dust and sombra de pinos  
moviendo el aire en la cocina oscura  
picking up olor de achiote y sofrito  
y de todo un pasado  
—Nora F. Kerr

entremeses  

en las tardes dormidas  
el sol te saca un jarabe dulce  
y la sal de tu piel  
me sazona los sueños  
qué ilusión un beso  
mora fresca en la sombra  
que la boca nunca alcanza  
ni en las noches de una  
—Nora F. Kerr  

Translation:  
hors d’oeuvres  

in the sleepy afternoons  
the sun draws a sweet syrup out of you  
and the salt of your skin  

seasons my dreams  
what a fantasy a kiss is  

a fresh blackberry in the shade  

which the mouth never reaches  
not even on nights with a moon  

—Nora F. Kerr  

My Family Loves Me  

I am a lesbian  

(I love womyn)  

I am understood from the outside  
by strangers,  

that is, my family.  

I speak to them of womyn,  

Authors, artists, friends.  

Why do you hate men? They say.  

Womyn are my people. I reply.  
Why are you so angry? They say.  

A friend once told me, I reply  

I don’t mind if you’re gay,  

But I don’t want to be seen with you.  

It’s nothing personal, really, but  

I don’t want Them thinking I’m gay too.  

Why am I angry? I think.  

The world shuns me. I reply.  

Why do you take things so personally? They say.  
My person is being killed. I reply.  

You always overreact. They say.  
I’m going to go visit some womyn friends. I reply.  
Why are you shutting us out? They say.
