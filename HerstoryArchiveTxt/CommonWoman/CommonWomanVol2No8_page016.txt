The SkiRack 1980: A new look for XC.

The SkiRack... a favorite of Vermont’s X-C skiers for a decade. Now,
on the eve of our tenth anniversary, The Rack gets a bright, new look,
just in time to help make this X-C season the most exciting ever.
And we're celebrating in style. Beginning with our grand reopening
on Thursday, Nov. 15, through Nov. 24, we’re offering...
Savings up to 75% on ‘fire sale’ clothing
Rock-bottom fire sale prices on all X-C packages
Grand Prize Drawing for a complete family X-C outfitting (clothing) ... absolutely free! Just stop in and register.*
Yes, The Rack is back. And beneath the new fashionable look is the
same old-fashioned care and pride that have made The Rack the
shop for X-C gear.
