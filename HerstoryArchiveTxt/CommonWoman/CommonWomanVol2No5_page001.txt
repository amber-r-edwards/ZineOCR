“We Cannot Live

» In the four-month period  
from Jan. 29 to May 29, twelve  
Black and one white women were  

@murdered in Boston’s Dor-  
hester-Roxbury section.  
Despite the physical proximity  
of the dead women, and the  

Similarly brutal ways in which  

@they were killed, the police  
claim the murders are unrelated.  

All but one were young women.  

Three of the women were stab-  

bed, five were strangled, the rest  
were bludgeoned to death — two  
of them were later burned as  
well. Most of them were found  
outdoors, but at least one was  
killed in her apartment. Three of  
the women were found within  
100 yards of each other.  
Women are outraged at the  
perfunctory police investigation  
which has resulted, and at the  
prejudiced press coverage which  
has delved into the sexual  
history of some of the victims,  
and hinted that at least two of  
the women died because they  
were “bad,” i.e. prostitutes — a  
treatment white women probably  
would not receive. Two primary  
patriarchal institutions — the  

“Law” and popular media — thus  
defuse the situation and convey  
by their relative indifference  
that, in this society, it is really  
OK to “off” women — especially  
if they are not white.  

These murders are not only  
racial, although certainly society  
permits — and thereby condones  
— the killing and degradation of  
Black and Third World women  
somewhat more than it does that

of whites. A Sergeant Murphy,  
assigned to the case, is quoted in  
the Phoenix (June 5, 1979)  
as saying that these “crimes of  
passion” are typically done by  
someone who is “not a nut. He’s  
just an average person who got a  
little carried away. Misogyny  
transcends class and race, and  
middle and upper class women  
are ‘in reality only nominally  
safer than others, experiencing a  

different type of oppression. By  
perpetuating the line that the  
murders have their origin in  
“passion,” the police and jour-  
nalists indicate that “boys will  
be boys” and suggest that we  
somehow provoke men to vic-  
lence. As with rape, there is  
nothing passionate about these  
murders — they are based on  
male hatred and fear of us.  

Police have sought only  
Black men in their investigation,  
and have arrested several of  
them in connection with three  
of the murders. Although it may  
be that there is no evidence  
which connects all the murders  
to a single individual, the police  
obviously further their own  
interests by insisting that the  
deaths are unrelated. They thus  
deny an analysis of violence  
against women which looks at us  
first as a class oppressed by all  
men. The deaths are connected  
by the victims’ color and sex —  
they were recognized by their  
killer as members of one of  
society’s most hated subgroups.  
To quote a (male) New York  
Times reporter, “the deaths of  
twelve Black women is not

TRASHING THE TRASH  

By a Furious Woman  
Against Pornography  

On June 27, 17 women  
outraged by pornography in  
Burlington to the point of  
action, coordinated a group-  
trashing of the Adult Book Shop  
at Tafts Corner, Williston. Some  
of the women, wearing masks,  
entered the store during business  
hours and destroyed what con-  
tents they could by throwing  
paint over books and magazines.  
In this well-timed event, women  
were able to do damage to the  
shop and escape before the  
manager could effectively call  
his Doberman, or contact police.  
This “illegal” action was under-  
taken with as much caution  
as possible, but still at the risk of  
possible physical harm and/or  
arrest.  
this  

The issued  

statement:  

Furious Women Avenge Por-  
nography claim responsibility  
for the trashing of the trash at  
the Taft Corner Adult Book  
Shop. We have taken so strong  
an action because we are tired of  
being exploited as passive vic-  
tims and sex objects.  

We poured paint over the  
books and magazines. We recog-  
nize that this action will not  
close the bookstore; it is one of  
a series of actions reflecting our  
outrage at the violence against  
women that continues to pene-  
trate our society. The owners of  
the store recently opened ano-  
ther store in St. Johnsbury  
without protest because the  
community was afraid to give  
the store publicity — we are not  
afraid. We must respond to the  
violence that a store like this  
promotes,

Men who read pornography  
beat their wives, rape women,  
and abuse children.  

People may defend porno-  

graphy on the basis of freedom  

of the press, but mostly oppressed  

people, women, third world  
people and children are exploited  
by pornography. We must be  
outlaws while we live in a nation  
whose civil liberties protect the  
perpetrators of violence. Pornography kills women.  

Who are the Furious Women  
Avenge Pornography? They are  
the resurfacing in ourselves of  
the spirit of our fierce, angry,  
intolerant foremothers — women  
who would not be silenced —  
women whose names we have  
never been taught — women  
whose names we are just begin-  
ning to know: Mother Jones,  
Sojourner Truth, Carrie Nation,  
Emily Pankhurst, Emma Gold-  
man, Joanne Little, Valerie  
Solanas,..* they are your sisters  
and mothers and daughters, the  
woman next door, they are your  
rage made into action.  

“The women affirm in  
triumph that all action is over-  
throw.”  

—Monique Wittig  

Women taking action, clear,  
angry, unapologetic action, in  
response to the daily violence  
against our minds and bodies is  
a vital step from the passive social  
response we’ve been taught. We  
are trained to be passive as  
women, and passive as citizens  
vs. the superstructure. It is  
imperative that we begin to  
react.  
It is not true that we have  
to lie back and take it.  

It is not true that our  
woman-hating legal system is  
dealing justly with the violators.
