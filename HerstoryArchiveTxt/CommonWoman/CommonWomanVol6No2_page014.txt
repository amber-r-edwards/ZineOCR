An Archives: To collect and
preserve Lesbian Culture in all
forms; A Library of Wimmin’s
literature — books, publications,
periodicals; A research and
resource exchange among Les-
bian Communities; A clearing-
house for information and con-
tacts; A network connection
between Lesbians throughout
the country and especially the
southeast.

Isolation and ignorance
keep us from knowing of the
work and lives of Lesbians who
are struggling beside us. The web
we create through our Lesbian
cultural ties helps to ensure our
Woman-survival and growth.

KCLH seeks to become a
center for sharing our informa-
tion, skills, and resources. The
collection currently contains
nearly 300 books, a variety
of national Wimmin’s and Les-
bian publications, and broad
research file categories on topics
such as: Parthenogenesis, Porno-
graphy & Violence, Right/left
Brain research, XY chromosome
mutation, Lesbian Political
action, Wimmin Centers, book-
stores, land spaces, cooperatives,
and collectives, Lesbian Mothers,
Racism & Klan violence, Femi-
nism, Political Theory, Wim-
min’s Spirituality, Lesbian
Separatism, Wimmin’s Herstory,
Cultural Events.

The Collection is seeking
additional materials on these and
other areas relating to Lesbian
Culture. Donated material can
be in the form of news clips,
published and unpublished arti-
cles, theses and research papers,
essays, studies and manuscripts,
as well as books, publications
and periodicals.

To help form a responsive,
informed cultural network con-
nection among Lesbian Commu-
nities:

—Add the Collection to
your mailing list and keep KCLH
updated and informed about
activities in your community;

—Mail copies of flyers/bro-
chures concerning Wimmin’s/
Lesbian events in your area
(Theater, Musical productions,
workshops, etc.);

Write KCLH and update
information about Wimmin’s
bookstores, centers, spaces, land,
collectives, cooperatives, in your
area;

—KCLH can always use
financial contributions, stamps
and office supplies;

Send books, periodicals,
publications and other Lesbian
literature.

Notes: Michigan Women's
Music Festival
By Paij

A nationwide raffle is
underway as a “land” fund-
raiser, by the Michigan Women’s
Music Festival. The C.U.N.T.s
(Coordinators’ Union Negotia-
ting Team) and the business met
recently at Crone Hill in Albany
at its second quarterly meeting.
The need for new land was a
priority agenda item. As most of
you know, the $2,000 raised
during the ‘81 Festival was
placed as a retainer on some lush
land (about 3 times the size of
Hesperia) about 30 miles from
Hesperia. The 2-part Rally (May
and August drawings) will hope-
fully generate the funds needed
to make the new land usable
— roads, water, electricity, etc.
The May drawing will feature:
First prize — 2 tickets to ‘82
Festival; Second prize — 1 ticket
to Fest; Third prize — 1 ticket to
Fest; Fourth prize — 1 ticket to
Fest; Fifth prize — 1 ticket to
Fest.

Raffle tickets ($5 each) can
be obtained by contacting Kris-
tie at 502 Haydenville Rd.,
Leeds, MA 01053 (413)
584-2959. Drawings for the

second raffle will be made
during the ‘82 Festival in
August.

Other issues were: Budget
(8-yr. history discussed; anyone
can have a copy by requesting
same from Kristie at Leeds, MA
address); Childcare; Security;
Conflict; the name “WWTMC” —
what does it mean?; and mis-
cellaneous items. Potential per-
formers for ‘82 were also dis-
cussed.

How Land Acquisition/
Ownership Will Work: the plan is
to form a non-profit, tax-exempt
corporation which will own the
land; the corporation will be
separate from the business.
Wealthy women who need a tax
shelter can benefit. Such a
corporation takes time, however,
and we don’t have it if we want
new land this year (and we sure
do if we can get it!) So, in the

meantime, the business will
borrow the first $75,000 and
start to purchase the land.
Eventually the corporation will
buy the land from the business
and then lease the land to the
business. The Festival needs to
borrow chunks of money
upwards of $500 from women,
who can afford to not get it
back for 2 or 3 years. Balloon
interest of 10-12%. This needs to
be done immediately. If you
know of such women, get in
touch with me (456-8865 or
P.O. Box 282, Plainfield, VT
05667). We have to have the
money in hand by May 1st. We
all feel it would give the Festival
the breath of life she so desper-
ately needs.

Communication was a hot
topic. An issue that helped us to
focus in this area was Lynn
Vera's resignation. We decided
that it was impossible to accept
Lynn’s resignation — although
we support her need to put it
out — because she is vital to the
festival as a worker and equally
important as a woman who
“shakes” the structure of the
Festival. It is important to all of
us and for the Festival and
future process to establish alter-
native and regular channels of
communication when direct
lines (like Lynn to Lisa...) don’t
work anymore, or have just been
frustrated to the point of
impasse. The C.U.N.T.s decided
that we could be that channel
when needed, if the woman
involved wanted us to act in that
capacity. We also recognized
that sometimes there will be
gaps that cannot always be
joined.
