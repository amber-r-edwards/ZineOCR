Women
and Society

By Julie Orvis

The Women and Society
Symposium held at St. Michael’s
College in late March had a
mixed air of grassroots and
academic feminism. The mixture
for some local feminists created
a tension, but a fruitful tension.
As feminists, we want to use our
minds and our hearts. We
want to think and to act. In this
sense, the symposium was like
Poetry. As we experience it we
think and act.

But there was a second
tension which was illustrated by
the two main speakers — Pat

Ms.) and Rosalyn Yalow (Nobel
laureate in medicine). It was a
tension between the feminist
and the non-feminist. Carbine

in her speech that she
approaches her life from a
feminist perspective (a declara-
tion that brought much applause
from the audience). Yalow
claimed in her talk that women’s

organizations are for
women.

The feeling was mainly
feminist, even though Yalow was
the keynote speaker and the
Greek woman pictured in the
publicity for the event was
picked because she was not a
feminist figure. Two things
stood out clearly. First, feminist
workshops and papers were the
most popular and most well
attended. Second, Carbine
received a standing ovation and
there was much verbal disap-
pointment in Yalow’s speech
expressed in the next morning’s
workshops.

The symposium finally was
clouded with academia and an
academic approach — professors
giving papers which point to
even more publications. My
sense, however, was that the
feminist scholars who were pre-

insecure

Friedan?

By Dian Kendrick Mueller

When the Creamery Educa-
tional Foundation announced
that Betty Friedan would be the
main speaker at this year's
‘WomenWomenWomen” — con-
ference, howls of outrage went
up from many members of the
women’s community. Betty
Friedan? A woman who had
stated publicly in the past that
there was no room for a crusade
for lesbian civil rights in the
women’s movement? That Friedan
had been hired by the
Creamery seemed an insult to
lesbians. Since the Creamery is
sponsoring this huge conference
on women’s issues, shouldn't it
be accountable to the women’s
community?

Hannah Dennison, coordi-
nator of “WomenWomen-
Women,” responds:

‘Women are accountable to
each other in general. I think
that there’s got to be a hell of a
lot more feeling of unity among
women. I think the factions are
what have kept the women’s
movement from going ahead as
far as it could and as fast as it
could. We have a common
need — all of us.

“This is supposed to be a

country where you have free-
dom of choice, and when the
conference planning committee
chose to have someone like
Betty Friedan here, their choice
had a lot of history behind it
and is not just what it appears to
be on the surface. The history is
that this conference — as it was
last year and as it will be for a
long time — is geared toward
women who are just beginning
to get their consciousness raised,
are just beginning to be aware of
their power and need some more
information and some permis-
sion. It’s also for women who've
been in the movement for a
couple of years and are looking
for a revitalization, for new areas
of focus.

“A lot of people who are
just becoming aware of the
women’s movement and are
needing some permission will get
their permission from someone
like Betty Friedan, more than
they would from someone like
Rita Mae Brown, because I think
Betty is a lot more acceptable
— she looks like everybody's
grandmother, she’s been around,
her face is out there, she’s gotten
an enormous amount of press

about the work she’s done for
the Equal Rights Amendment. I
also think that for the women
who've been dabbling and get-
ting their feet wet in the movi-
ment for the last couple of years
Betty is still a very current
person who'll light a fire under
them. And, who knows, she may
have something to say to the
radicals — they may learn
something from Betty.

“We've never said that we’re
a conference for the radical
lesbian faction. We try to have
a forum that will be of interest to
them, though. We’ve put out to
the community, ‘Hey, we’re
really willing to give you the
space and to pay you the work-
shop fee and so on’ in order to
get a forum there. There hasn’t
been a very big response.

Speaking of Friedan’s image
as an anti-lesbian, Dennison
says:

“When I heard what Betty’s
stance was historically, I was
really surprised and worked on
right away, trying to find out
what exactly was going on. I got
the message via the network that
she had been in the past and

YVONNE WANROW

(This article was written
with information from the April,
1979, issue of Off Our Backs.)

April 16 marked the open-
ing of the second murder trial of
Yvonne Wanrow in Spokane,
Washington. In 1972, Yvonne, a
Colville Indian Woman (I capital-
ized woman on purpose, it is as
important a label to me as the
other two), shot and killed a
known white child molester
as he burst into her friend’s
home to attack the women and
children there. For this action,
clearly a self-defense reaction,
Yvonne was tried for murder

By Lynn Vera

and imprisoned. She is still, six
years later, fighting for her right
to defend herself and her child-
ren (and our right to do the
same), and for her freedom.

Why is this case dragging
on? Why weren't the charges
dropped years ago, in recogni-
tion of the action as self-de-
fense? Why do the (white,
male) courts want Yvonne
Wanrow behind bars for 25
years?

The ramifications of this
case seem intense to me, and
very scary. The U.S. government
wants all people, especially wo-

men, vulnerable and defenseless.
Yvonne’s successful defense of
herself, her children and her
home is an example to all of us
to fight back; that she, a woman,
demonstrated such refusal
to submit is threatening enough
that she is a Native American
woman refusing to bow to the
white male invader adds another
dimension to her “crime.”

It is essential to see that the
violence against Yvonne, first by
the attacker and later by the
courts, is another part of the
longest war in the history
