Nuclear  
Amazement  

By Joyce Cheney  

The issue of why anyone  
supports nuclear technology  
amazes me. They say we need it  
as a source of energy. Even if  
nuclear power were the only  
source of energy (which it isn’t),  
then we just have to use less  
energy. I won't die for a toaster  
or a street lamp. And dying is  
the issue — not comparative cost  
of energy sources — but dying.  

When a coal mine collapses,  
all the poor workers die. The  
rich boss hires a new batch and  
reopens the mine. He gets richer;  
he feels no pain. When a nuclear  
power plant leaks or explodes,  
the radioactivity falls on the  
trailers and tenements — and on  
the estates and penthouses.  
Don’t the rich and powerful  
relate to their deaths?  

In the old wars, they sent  
the peons in to bludgeon each  
other. They played us like chess  
pieces, killed us, until they grew  
bored of the game. Now for  
their wars they have toys that  
can blast us all to ash — many  
times over. Don't they see  
themselves in that ashpile?  
Nuclear bombs don’t read bank  
statements, do they? Why don’t  
the very rich and powerful relate  
to their own deaths in the  
nuclear wars they plan?  

And then I heard that the  
very rich and powerful have  
whole cities built underground,  
theoretically bombproof. A  
whole city underground in up-  

state New York somewhere,  
another in Colorado, kept as  
secret as possible from us. A city  
with shopping malls, apartments,  
office buildings, movie theaters,  
pinball parlors. Whole cities  
waiting for the rich refugees to  
arrive. I heard about the govern-  
ment building being built in  
Washington now, where eight  
stories of it are underground and  
bombproof. Whole cities under-  
ground and waiting. Like out of  
a space movie but for real, and  
as secret from us as they can  
manage.  

The rich will go there. They  
feel protected. They support  
nuclear technology because it  
feeds their power disease, and  
because they think they have a  
way out.  

Only the very rich have  
access to these underground  
cities. And the rest of us who  
don’t have pass-keys — why do  
many of us still support nuclear  
power? I think it is from buying  
the propaganda — the brainwash-  
ing about safety and necessity;  
and because dealing with the  
enormity of the very real horrors  
of nuclear power is so scary and  
overwhelming that many folks  
grow numb, and just do not deal  
with it. How do you fight such a  
monolithic horror?  

Nuclear power is the most  
overwhelming threat — along  
with being driven mad by the  
patriarchy — in my life.  

WOMEN AGAINST  

MUTILATION  

(Reprinted from Off Our Backs)  

New York City: At lunch  
hour on Wednesday, October 31,  
30-50 women (with a couple of  
men) turned out for a standing  
picket in Isaiah’s Wall Park  
across from the United Nations  
building, creating the first public  
action in the U.S. against genital  
mutilation of women (clitorid-  
ectomy, infibulation, Pharaonic  
incision). The event was quiet.  
Besides a big banner saying,  
“Women Against Mutilation of  
30 Million Girls,” and two other  
feminist signs, a few members of  
the Spartacist League, an anti-  
feminist, left Trotskyist organi-  
zation, showed up with signs  
announcing themselves, which  
made it look like they had  
organized it (since the banner  
seemed more like a slogan than  
an organization title). Other  
women complained to the organ-  
izers afterwards. After the organ-  
izers read statements which  
included women’s personal testi-  
mony about witnessing or under-  
going genital mutilation, partici-  
pants circled around and, at the  
organizers’ direction, recited in  
turn a particular atrocity against  
women (“Footbinding!”  
“Wife beating!” “Rape!”  
“Genital mutilation!”) while  
bearing lit candles, using a sign  
listing violent crimes against  

Seeing My Mother Behind Me  
in the Mirror  

By Lynn Vera  

(Sent from Michigan,  
August 16, 1979)  

Hitchhiking alone from Ver-  
mont to northwestern Michigan,  
I found the time to write down  
some thoughts about my mo-  
ther. At night I slept in fields,  
trusting in the tall grass and  
wildflowers to hide me from  
wandering men, calling on the  
energies of special friends to  
shield me as I slept. I thought  
about mom often as I waved  
down cars on the freeway,  
climbed in and out of huge  
trucks with my heavy pack, slept  
under the stars by the road. She  
taught me the self-trust that  
encourages me to do such things;  
were she to hear of this adven-  
ture she would be afraid, yet in  
there also would be respect and  
some kind of pride.  

Mom, first generation Portu-  
guese woman in this country.  
Born, grew, married and raised  
six children, five daughters, in  
New Bedford, Mass., “Little  
Portugal,” a fishing city. Her  
parents came from Portugal; her  
father a grocer in the Portuguese  
neighborhood, her mother a mill  
worker. She grew up loving and  
respecting her people, the work,  
the language; and she grew up  
fighting racist/classist/ethnic pre-  
judice. From her I learned to  
respond angrily to the “Por-  
tagee” and “greenhorn” slaps  

that were thrown so easily at  
Portuguese people less assimila-  
ted, poorer, less upwardly mo-  
bile than I, thrown by the richer,  
more politically powerful,  
though far less numerous (New  
Bedford is 85% Portuguese)  
Anglos, Irish Catholics. Many of  
them were my friends and  
couldn't understand my right-  
eous fury; “but we don’t mean  
you, Lynn.” They did mean  
my non-English-speaking aunts  
and cousins, but surely not  
consciously.  

Mom often told me a story  
about a time when she, upward-  
ly mobile, college woman, proud  
Portuguese beauty from the  
South End, attended a yacht  
club dance with a rich young  
man (soon her husband, my  
father). He too was fully Portu-  
guese, but son of a judge, a  
different class, a different neigh-  
borhood. In the women’s room,  
talking with some women she  
was ‘supposed to get to know,”  
she said her name, Cecilia  
Baldo. Upon recognizing that  
she was Portuguese the women,  
being “nice,” hastily “reassured”  
her that “she could pass for  
Irish.” Mom always told us how  
she got angry with them, deci-  
ded she didn't need their friend-  
ship, and left the dance. I  
treasure that story, that image of  
my mother, the sense of ethnic  
identity that she cherishes and  

taught me.  

It would be romantic  
though to simply see my mother  
super mom, Portuguese, Catho-  
lic, all American mom — a  
lesbian. She doesn’t identify  
herself as a lesbian often. She  
says she loves this one woman.  
We joke about how dykey she’s  
looking these days, sometimes  
she shares her fear that her life is  
so different than she'd ever  
imagined. She now lives with her  
lover, her lover's five young  
children, and my youngest sister,  
now 17.  

She validated her work  
outside the home — teaching,  
Cursillo movement (Christian  
gatherings for women), friends.  
Her marriage strained because  
she stopped being such a dutiful  
wife at her own expense — Mom,  
I watched you refuse to submit  
to ridicule, I saw you get past  
the stinging pain of dad’s com-  
ments and continue to figure out  
who you are. Twenty-five years  
of “perfect” (a good cover)  
marriage, and then you said no  
more “sex as a wifely duty.”  
Dad couldn’t handle that, he  
couldn’t understand what you  
needed beyond a house in a  
good neighborhood, money to  
pay the bills, a husband who was  
“loyal.”  

My mother divorced my  
father, an ugly, very drawn out,

women as a model. After a while  
of this, some women started  
getting creative, yelling when  
their turns came, “Manhood!”  
“Prostitution!” “The Virgin  
Mary!” “No jobs!” “Homophobia!” Several got laughs. The  
demonstration ended with a  
goddess chant, “O Maaa, Maaa,”  
etc. Many passers-by, when  
finding out what genital mutila-  
tion was, supported us and  
wished us luck. Most ignored us,  
some were confused by the  
“Maaas.”  
A Nigerian male student mounted a lone counter picket with a  
sign saying, “This is nothing but  
cultural bigotry; nothing but  
cultural chauvinism, western  
propaganda, and a racist ideo-  
logy. What about:  

—Millions of children killed  
here by abortion.  

—Brutalization of children  
in drugs and sex.  

—Sterilization of men and  
women that kills millions of  
potential children.”  

The organizers picked  
Halloween as the date of their  
action because children take up  
collections for UNICEF.  
UNICEF, like WHO (World  
Health Organization) and the  
UN generally, refuses to oppose  

“We cannot interfere in  

because  
customs and traditions.” This is  
despite calls for its abolition  
from a conference in Khartoum,  
Sudan, February, 1979, and by  
WHO's regional director for  
northern Africa. The organizers  
pointed out that during the  
International Year of the Child

not be on the agenda of the  
Mid-Decade of Women Confer-  
ence in Copenhagen July 15-29,  
1980, unless African countries  
add it during a planning confer-  
ence to be held this December.  

The protest was organized  
by two women, Lisa Volkov of  
Toronto and Diane Conklin of  
D.C., with help from Karen  
Reynolds, also from Washington.  
They called themselves Women  
Against Mutilation and set out  
to get publicity around the issue,  
which frequently meant letting  
people know female genital  
mutilation occurred. Conklin told me neither “clitoridectomy” nor  
“infibulation” is in any regular  
dictionary except the Oxford  
English Dictionary, and “clitorid-  
ectomy” only occurs in the  
second supplement! Most of  
their information is from Fran  
Hosken’s research on the topic.  

According to the organizers,  
30,000,000 girls throughout  

northern and eastern Africa  
undergo some form of genital  
mutilation. The operation is  
performed by relatives (in modernizing countries like Somalia, in a hospital) when the child is 4-8 years old.  
It invariably involves removal  
(by scraping and gouging) of the  
clitoris, as well as outer labia.  
The vulval area is then stitched
