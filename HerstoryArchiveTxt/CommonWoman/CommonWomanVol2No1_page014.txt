Of Woman Born, by Adrienne
Rich

Reviewed by Nancy Ford

My armor against the
mundaneity of days succeeding
upon days is to commit to
memory favorite lines of verse
with which to re-vision the
ordinary. Leaving the house each
morning and making the ascent
up the hill is transmuted into
rising up out of the lake and
toward the mountain. In my
descent I have “eyes at the back
of my head;” I recite Denise
Levertov’s archetypal lines over
and over, incubated, mellowed,
inscaped.

A phenomenologist in spirit,
however, it is to Adrienne Rich
in Diving Into The Wreck that I
turn again and again for a song
of myself: for, “it is easy to
forget what I came for... the
thing I came for: the wreck and
not the story of the wreck, the
thing itself and not the myth.”

The question then is to render
the thing itself clearly,
objectively; to lift the
phenomenon out of the
sedimented web of language and
make manifest the essential
nature of one's subject.

And so, the poet turned to
the thing itself, the concept of
motherhood, and began the

torturous work of lifting one
conceptual
interstice from
another

predications of
“experience” and “institution”
until the two revealed
themselves. This is the heuristic
structure within which one reads
Of Woman Born: motherhood as
a potential experience and
motherhood as a concretized
sociological fact and institution.
When the biological potential for
pregnancy, parturition, and
raising a child comes into being
it is immediately shaped by
cultural facts. Cultural facts are
seen as the totality of “here &
now” life — structures that
determine an individual’s growth
and evolution in a society. And
here Rich adds an important
sub-thesis: the cultural fact par
excellence that has to do with
motherhood is patriarchy. The
word patriarchy or patriarchal
describes all of those historical
moments wherein the male of
the species has or accedes to
control over the female of the
species. Motherhood as
“institution” is and has been,
says Rich, patriarchal.

Of Rich’s two theses the first,
that motherhood is the
“potential relationship of any
woman to her powers of
reproduction and to children,” is
incontrovertible. The second
thesis, “that motherhood as
institution aims at ensuring that
that potential — and all women
— shall remain under male
control,” is open to debate. And
since the book’s arrival two
years ago, the critics have pulled
and tugged at what they decry as
Rich’s angry feminist rhetoric in

her explication of the latter
thesis.

Rich moves the reader
through the lived dichotomy of
a mother’s ambivalent “anger
and tenderness” toward her
offspring to the more disturbing
possibility of outright feelings of
violence towards one’s children.
In between, one is taken on a
personal and historical journey
through the inception of
patriarchy, the myths and
realities surrounding matriarchy,
the subversion of positive
matriarchal theory, the history
of gynecology and childbirth in
the Western world, and two
provocative chapters on Mothers
and Sons and Mothers and
Daughters. In her Afterword,
Rich provides the reader with
what she sees as the ethical
challenges that inhere in the
stark realities uncovered in her
analysis.

This is the kind of book that
makes one burn inside, devour
black coffee, smoke cigarettes
(even though you've given them
up) and talk to one’s cat out
loud. It is the kind of book that
transforms one’s relationships to
self and to others. It is an
unleashing book, a radically
unsettling book, for it is a virtual
history reflecting the books of
myths in which our names do
not appear. It is so important...
Read it!

existence is not readily perceived

even by the oppressed,
seemingly drastic measures
become necessary in order to

disrupt the status quo that has
perpetuated the conditions
under which discriminatory
treatment has flourished. If one
accepts the proposition that our
society has been, and is, riddled
with sexism, a logical corollary
emerges; that persons have been
oppressed (i.e. denied access to
the power afforded to others) on
the basis of gender. While
members of both sexes and the
society itself have suffered, and
continue to suffer the effects of
this deprivation, much the same
as whites and white society have
suffered from racism, the
personal and daily effect of
sexism is felt more acutely by
those who have been denied
power. Just as racism involves
whites and blacks, sexism
involves men and women. This,
however, does not mean that
whites have been victims of
racism in the personal sense that
blacks have. As the race which
traditionally has been afforded
power in this society, there is no
necessity for whites to fight for
and seize power as there is for
blacks. Neither does the
prevalence of sexism in the
society mean that men have
suffered the effects to the
extent, and in the multitude of
ways, that women have. As the
sex which has traditionally been
afforded power in this society,
men have no need to strive for
the right to power, as it has not
been denied to them on the basis
of gender. Therefore, it becomes
the responsibility of those with
access to power to encourage
and aid the powerless in their
struggle for recognition, if the
situation is ever to be remedied.

Since a good portion of power
is illusory (that is, if you believe
that someone has power over
you, your reactions will reflect
and reaffirm this as a
self-fulfilling prophecy), the
powerless must create the
illusion of power for themselves,
if it is ever to become a reality.
Those who have been treated for
a lifetime, and, in a larger sense,
for centuries, as secondary and
inferior, need to assert
themselves and their comrades as
primary and independent, in
order to feel what the
non-oppressed have
automatically and traditionally
taken for granted.

Merely because the
characteristic isolated as the
factor to be determinative of
differing treatment involves the
gender of the individual, does
not mean that in all instances
where one’s gender constitutes
the criteria for a distinction that
the distinction is sexist. Rest
rooms are distinguished on the
basis of sex, yet the exclusion of
one sex from them does not
constitute sexism, as long as
there are adequate facilities for
that sex. Figuratively, we live in
a society that has historically
given women substantially fewer
and comparatively substandard
facilities, while affording men
exclusive control of those
facilities which are more
numerous and desirable.

The art world has historically
been dominated by men, and has

excluded women as active
participants. It should be
remembered that “Women
Rising” as a women’s art show
has been necessitated by the
reluctance of “public” galleries,
generally dominated by men, to
recognize and foster a public
awareness of women’s art. But
for “Women Rising” and other
women-oriented art shows,
women would have little or no
opportunity to share, or be

encouraged in, their artistic
endeavors. It was hoped that
supportive men would

understand the necessity for an
environment, be it even for an
evening, where women could be

in complete and exclusive
control; not as a vengeful,
retaliatory act, but as an
opportunity to share creative
endeavors in an atmosphere,
elsewhere non-existent, devoid
of the vestiges of oppression,
where women’s power and
authority would be undeniable,
with no risk that the presence of
the symbols of “traditional
authority” would overshadow
the still tenuous power of
women as women. To ask for
power, and to allow denial of
that request to thwart the quest,
only serves to emphasize,
illustrate, and perpetuate the
degree of powerlessness of the
beseechers. To attempt to
invalidate the request itself
unequivocally demonstrates,
recognizes, and necessitates that
the request become a behest.

President when he allotted only
15 minutes to discuss the entire
spectrum of women’s issues.
Ellie Smeal and Arlie Scott,
the president and vice president
of the National Organization for
Women (NOW), were among the
first Advisory Committee
members to resign, expressing
outrage over the firing. In
commenting on the sudden
dismissal of Abzug, feminist
leaders have charged that Carter

thinks “women should be seen
and not heard.” Ms. magazine
editor Gloria Steinem said,
“Now he is going to have to do
something for us to get us to
vote for him... in order to make
up for this extraordinary
breach.” Mildred M. Jeffrey,
president of the National
Women’s Political Caucus, said
that “the principles and
purposes of this committee have
been violated.” Abzug herself
warned, “We're going to increase
our demands. We're not going to
accept lip service anymore.”

So, “Bye, Bye Bella!” You
may be gone but you're not
forgotten; in fact, your greatest
contribution may be in setting
the record straight, in being a
lightning rod, in flushing out the
latent “good ole boy” attitudes
that saturate every aspect of
American politics. In short, your
token government appointment
may prove much less important
than your untimely dismissal.
