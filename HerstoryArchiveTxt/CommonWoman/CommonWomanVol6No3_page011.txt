It’s Like This

Reviewed by Michiyo Cornell

I must say I like Doris
Davenport’s book very much.
Her poetry is simple and

polished like the round stones I
used to collect from the riverbed
which appeared almost non-
descript but broken open,
revealed shining black crystals,
green translucent crystals like
new spring leaves and bits of

mica that glinted like fragments

of the moon. It’s like this
reminds me very much of my
childhood rocks; the basic ele-
ment of the book once
opened — is a sense of humor
and curiosity about the world,
whatever it may bring.
Sometimes my woman-filled
world brings alienation. Aliena-
tion that comes from defending
my artistic and/or political
vision when it doesn’t quite fit
in with the agenda and what-
evers of white women. I get
awfully tired and tactless during
such times, but Doris gracefully
writes of the situation in these
words:
white boys run America.
black boys run, period.
& white girls run the wimmin’s
movement
& everybody runs over and from
black wimmin.

they said your place is not here.
they said—you have no place.
they are wrong. listen.

Review of The Boy Who Studied Performed by Bread and Puppet
Theatre

Fear

Then there’s the matter of
perspective for every artist. Who
do you write for? Why even
write? What style do you use
and why? Doris doesn’t try to
write in some false elegiac, lyric
strain (and I do mean strain); she
writes in ordinary street lan-
guage about events in the lives of
women:

this ride keeps getting longer

and the days keep getting
shorter

and my back keeps getting
tireder

and my knees give out too.

my patience gets thinner
and my bugs got plants. . .

The tiredness and courage of an
ordinary working woman comes
through. She’s tired and grumpy
— this sister — but she gets
through her days with far less
privilege than most white
women ever think women can
do without.

I could go on and on about
Doris’ book. It’s a cause for joy
when a Third World lesbian poet
comes to press at all and a cause
for greater joy when she says
what she has to say without
compromise as Doris does. It’s
like this is available for $3.50
prepaid from Doris Davenport,

It’s a benefit for the Bur-
lington Peace Coalition, a per-
formance by the Bread and
Puppet Theatre, and young and
old, women and men, we come,
hungry for the show. The crowd
hushes as the troupe enters from
the rear of the theatre playing
simple and unusual instruments.
We quickly open ourselves to
this well-loved Vermont group as
they begin to unfold their tale,
The Boy Who Studied Fear.

This is the story of a young
boy setting off from home on
his donkey to learn about fear in
the world. I am immediately
fascinated and in love with the
donkey and with the boy who is
gentle yet brave — he cries real
tears — a welcome role model
for young boys. (Granted it
would have been nice to have
had a young girl in the role
but...) The boy is a puppet
lovingly held and moved by a
look-alike person. The two skill-
fully blend together until the
puppet becomes passionate and

alive.

The bad guys are also
delightful — delightfully bad.
They are a chorus of corporate
white men who appear through-
out the play mouthing in turn
their leader's words and per-
forming his dirty work. They are
the bringers of fear in many
guises. The play consists of a
series of scenes in which the
boy, both on his donkey and off
(after it is killed), encounters
different situations in which the
bad guys always have a hand.
There's a crowded city, excel-
lently portrayed, a prison camp,
a living room scene. The puppet
craft is intense and lifelike and I
am drawn in, wanting to enjoy,
yet as these scenes unfold I
begin to get more and more
upset — not by the bad guys, but
by a lacking in clarity and
sensitivity of the images within
the play.

After the first few skits I
forced myself to admit that I
wasn't understanding lots that
was going on. Characters and

I carry a homesickness like a
permanent ache in me; long for
the Black girls and women that I
grew up with: the tone of voice,
the music, a certain way of
moving and being in the world. I
sometimes fear that I will die in
the whiteness of a Vermont
winter, surrounded by white
faces who don’t know the
“downhomeness” that I long to
touch. jazz dancin wif mama
gives me that “downhomeness”
and comforts me more than I
care to admit. Linda Jean Brown
catches the accents and concerns
of Black lesbians with an eye
and ear for telling detail. The
world of Black people is there;
this book reminds me of what I
miss.

“jazz dancin wif mama” is
the title story and my favorite of
the stories that Linda wrote.
“Jazz” or Jasmine is going home
on the bus to tell her mother
that she is a lesbian: “Jazz hadn’t
told mama yet — one reason why
she come home this time. tellin
mama was right now, but tellin
this took seein mama clean in
her face.” Jazz reaches home
and meets her mother only to
find out as her mother confesses
in her turn: “‘Maxine and me
been together more than a year
now. since close after the first
time I seen you in the flesh,
Jasmine. She good to me and love
me. And I love her,’ mama began.” 
Talk about shared growth: It’s a
delightful ending to a charming
story.
Events often seemed wrapped
in a sort of mystical, mythical
air that wouldn't clear. The
children that I was around, being
less self-conscious than the
adults, were asking, ‘What's
that?, What’s happening?” Written
signs held up by the narrator
were not read aloud for the
children, it seemed like a simple
enough change to rectify that, (I
thought) and I mentioned it to
one of the troupe members after
the performance. Her response
to this was that she loved to hear
children asking questions during
the performance. I leave doubt-
ing she’s ever been responsible
for a child during a play or
movie when continual explana-
tion was necessary... For the most
part, despite its attraction as
Puppet theatre, there wasn’t
much care taken to make the
play understandable or special
for children. Bread and Puppet
puppets are so powerful and
wonderful, and children are so
willing to embrace a story about
another child, that it seems a sad
lack that this performance was
not made more accessible to

Linda’s stories became a
rush in my blood, an affirmation
/confirmation of things I
thought and felt. What would it
be like to go with the Venceremos
Brigade to Cuba or (as an
independent woman) to help
rebuild a Third World country
after a revolution? I would have
to... bring... what... knowledge I
gained from that country to the
struggle here. Eventually, it all
comes home and I claim this
country as home just as the main
character in “Cora, Luck” had
to come home: “Cora had begun
to see the similarities in the
brown Espera people and her
own folks at home. She began to
mark the similarities of dark
people throughout the world. She
realized the necessity of being
among her own — doing the
work she was doing in Espera.

She told all this to Luz, who
understood and did not under-
stand. Cora decided to return to
her home and work there.”

But all cannot be moonlight
and rebuilding a Third World
country; some of us go under to
drugs, to murder, to alcohol and
to plain exhaustion from fight-
ing the forces that affect all dark
lesbians. Sometimes lesbian
pride and a devoted lover cannot
make up for lack of money and
the homophobia and misogyny
to which dark lesbians are
particularly vulnerable. Linda
records these, too, as in the

them. 
This is 1982. It is a time in
which many political people
have grown to include racism,
classism, sexism into our analy-
ses of change and revolution.
Political art and theatre, bread
of our revolution, food for our
spirit, must reflect and be
responsive to these issues. We
need fresh bread! This is 1982, a
time in which we have single
parent families, women truck
drivers, non-white people (not
horses and bears). What I am
talking about here is that scenes
throughout the play used sexist
and racist stereotypes. Why were
there oriental horses represent-
ing beautiful women? Why was
the truck driver's wife a bear?
Why was there a large black ape
used to represent evil? The
careless (or is it calculated?) use
of these types of images is in the
tradition of Walt Disney and
other racist, sexist image makers.
The play settles in as a
discomforting mixture of good
politics and lack of politics. It
ended with a plea to all of us to
listen to the messages of the

Linda Jean Brown

Nell and Cora were lovers for
five years but the relationship
went sour because of Nell’s
brutality and alcoholism. Here is
Nell coming home on the
train: “The train came in time,
changing her focus from her self
— the state of her body — to
dealing or not dealing, with the
half dozen men who inhabited
the train car... She felt she was
sailing home, like a virtuous
warrior, with the single-minded-
ness of arriving safely to open,
welcoming arms, and the
womyn’s waving handkerchiefs
and tears, Beer and fantasy.” It’s
hard, hard to face what drugs,
alcohol, prison and murder do to
us but Linda does that and
records it in accessible language
we recognize as our own ton-
gue’s speech.

jazz dancin wif mama is a
wonderful collection of short
stories that covers a wide range
of Black lesbian experience from
the death of a friend, to living
alone or living by two in the
country and the city. Any dark
lesbian can recognize our con-
cerns in her stories of Black
lesbians confronting their differ-
ent but linked destinies. Linda’s
book is available for $4.60

politics of the play were capped

was the message sung over and

wondering, if he who has an ear

In Vermont as “everywhere
else we have to hunt for crumbs
of integrity and politics in our
public creative works. Let’s hope
that Bread and Puppet theatre
group continues its good work
and especially that it begins to
open itself to changing its
offensive and stereotyped
material. In this revolution we
need bread, not crumbs to rise!
