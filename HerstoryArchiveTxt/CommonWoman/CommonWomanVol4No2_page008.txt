CIB LIBERATION:

2’ Theatre In Burlington

By Deb Ennis

On April 12, Rhode Island
Feminist Theatre (RIFT) will
return to Burlington to perform
their original play Internal
Injury. The play is a potent,
powerful production about the
lives of battered women.

According to reviews, Internal
Injury is not an evening of
shocking or sensational violence.
The stage is inhabited by only
three actresses throughout.
Through the three women char-
acters, the audience is shown
how women in all socio-
economic and cultural environ-
ments are subjected to beatings.
Regardless of their backgrounds,
the women in the play are
indicative of women who learn
to live with abuse out of love,
fear and lack of alternatives or
outside help.

It is a play that vividly
portrays the beatings, the pain
and suffering, the mental
anguish, the embarrassment and
social stigmas battered women
experience. The women relive
the awful moments of the first
time they were beaten and, as
the beatings become more fre-
quent, they depict the steady
decay of their families, their
self-respect and health. Rapidly
moving and effective dialogue
places the women into their own
distinctive environments, but
also unites them in their com-
mon agonies. The men doing the
beating are graphically alluded
to, though they are never
actually seen onstage.

Rhode Island
Theatre’s goal is
battered women’s

Feminist
to unveil
problems

from behind the cloud of social
secrecy. RIFT wants to show
other battered women that they
are not alone.

Rhode Island — Feminist
Theatre was in Burlington in
September to perform their play
Paperweight, a comedy about
women office workers.

RIFT is a feminist collective
born in 1973 of a desire to
create exciting, original theater.
They will be at Royal Tyler
Theater, University of Vermont,
on Sunday, April 12, at 8 p.m.
with their play Internal Injury.
They are being brought to
Burlington by Women Helping
Battered Women and UVM's
Women’s Organization and
Referral Center.

Michigan Music Festival.

By the We Want The
Music Collective

Over the last five months
the womyn involved in the
Michigan Womyn’s Music Festi-
val have been reworking the
structure of the organizing group
involved in putting on the
festival, and re-establishing our
goals. We have come to grips
with the reality that the festival
has not been a success at being
collectively run.

We want to take more
definite steps in this year’s
festival to make the event meet
the needs of more womyn who
may want to attend. It is a fact
that many womyn of color,
many working-class womyn,
differently-abled womyn, older
womyn, younger womyn, fat
womyn — any of us who are
outside of the white-middle-class
majority — are either not attend-
ing the festival or attending and
feeling uncomfortable.

Michigan is known to some
womyn as a haven away from
the pain and bullshit of the real
world. For other womyn the
pain is felt even stronger at this
and other womyn’s gatherings.
We have over the years strength-
ened our organizational skills,
but we are asking the national
community to work with us to
move beyond the basic physical
structuring of this event and
help us work towards it reflect-
ing more where we want our
community to be going.

Some of our initial
ideas have centered around working
out structures that will assist
womyn who economically or
because of physical disabilities
would not be able to attend. We
are starting a program of giving
incentive for communities to
organize busing based on sliding
scale fees. We will donate eight
four-day tickets to the festival
for an average large bus (42
seats) to help start making
money available for these group
efforts. If each community
could organize a busing program
based on a sliding scale, many
womyn who have never been
able to attend the festival would
be able to come. We will be
organizing a system of commu-
nity sleeping tents for womyn
who cannot afford to own their
own tents or for urban womyn
for whom camping is not part of
their lives. A great idea of a
community “blanket bank”
came in from a womon from
Boston — a system to assist
womyn who come unprepared
for some of those chilly Michi-
gan nights.

Last year we started a
system of attendant care service
at the festival for differently-
abled womyn, enabling them to
deal more easily with the out-
door structure of the festival site
without incurring the personal
cost of hiring an attendant to
assist them during their stay. We
want to improve that system and
need input from the differently-
abled womyn’s community.

Please write us with your
input and suggestions of how we
can further expand the festival.
Think about organizing busing in
your community so that more
womyn can attend. If you know
of a local music group that we
may not have heard of, encour-
age them to submit a tape to
us. We have changed our internal
structure so that it better
reflects the community as a
whole. We will be organizing a
political tent at the 1981 festival
for the continuing discussion of
these issues.
