LESBIAN CONFORMITY

By R. Mitchell
Writing this |

er my viewpoint
si my. criticisms.

I spent the last
few years in love with a straight
friend; I embraced this

spring my lesbianism. Not knowing any gay women, I talked
with a counselor who suggested I attend the Michigan women’s
music festival: I went to the
festival and since August have
also spent time among lesbians

in Washington, D.C. These experiences have evoked mixed feelings in me, but the most prevalent among them
being alienation, a low regard for
“lesbian culture” and, sad to
say, an exacerbation of the
loneliness that is my main
motivation for coming out.

I would like to explain some of
the aspects of this estrangement,
as I'm sure it is a widespread
phenomenon for many women
in their initial contact with
dykes and as such is extremely
detrimental to the professed
goals of dykes.

My background will help to
make my points. I was raised in
Detroit in a blue-collar neighbor-
hood. My father deserted us
when I was eight years old,
leaving my mother to support
four children as a secretary. The
economic insecurity of our lives
often impressed itself upon me,
especially during lapses of child
support. I recall on one occasion
my mother hiring a detective to
track down my father in order
to reinstate the flow of pay-
ments. This is important in that
in my twenties I took advantage
of the opportunity to accumulate
some money for economic
struggles in the Third World. I

went to Cuba to build houses
with the Fifth Venceremos Bri-
gade. During these years I
worked closely with many
women from diverse economic
and ethnic backgrounds — black,
white, Mexican, Hispano-
American, Chinese, Korean,
Japanese — all of whom I would
consider feminists as this was an
inherent aspect of our politics.

I was hired among the first
group of women since World
War II to work as laborers in an
oil refinery. After that job I
spent five years on a General
Motors assembly line, often
working 50 and 60 hours a week
at grueling, manual labor. I
moved to the mountains, where
I constructed a house with the
help of two girlfriends and a
male carpenter, investing the
money I had saved while at GM.
In the mountains I worked as a
maid and in a sawmill, again
among the first women hired as
laborers in that mill.

While never active in the
women’s movement “per se,” I
have struggled against sexism all
my life. My adolescence was a
painful series of battles in which
I contended with, as best I
could, the pressures exerted on
me to affect more “femininity.”
As an adult I’ve fought for
women’s rights in industry. I
have never failed, in any of my
jobs, to gain the respect of the
men I worked with and am sure
that I made some inroads

concerning what the least sexist
way to spell ‘woman’ is. As
with racism, I believe our task
is to examine our attitudes and
relationships on their deepest
levels, as opposed to merely
“whitewashing” our language

would catch us at blasphemy.

Recently, at a women’s
dance in D.C., I was rudely and
presumptuously accused by a
lesbian I’d never met before, of
being a sexist. Apparently my
manners, phrases, choice of
words do not conform to what
many dykes deem “acceptable”
and, having just come out, I'm
not “hip” enough to avoid faux
pas — heaven forbid. This is only
one of many attitudes that I
have suffered at the hands of
lesbians that I find extremely
insulting and antagonistic.

In Burlington, the women’s
community is engaged in a
debate on classism, as well it
should be. I sensed rancor from
dykes I met there upon learning
that I owned a house. This was
the “profound” expression of
their anti-bourgeois stance.
Apparently these women are
unaware that the romanticization
of poverty is a bourgeois indul-
gence. Working people generally
are proud of the fruits of their
labor. Incidentally, classes are
defined by their relation to the
means of production. Capitalists
own the means of production.

Workers are not forced to see
themselves as having accumu-
lated some abundance.

I have encountered widespread and fanatical adherence to ideas and perceptions that strike me as simplistic to the point of absurdity: men are evil; men are the enemy; women are good; lesbians are superior to straight women; more honest, loving, supportive.

I am disinclined to espouse
any of these simplistic views,
having learned at least that the
world is not so easily defined.
And I am loath to closet myself
amongst dykes as a choice of lifestyle, or for the purpose of
“purification,” to castigate my-
self so that I might avoid further
“embarrassments.”

Coming out to me does not
mean the reductionism of my
values and philosophy or the
restriction of whom I view as
allies or friends. I see it as
enriching my life, a way to know
myself better in order to deepen
my humanitarianism and com-
mitment to all progressive
struggles. I firmly believe that if
the lesbian movement continues
with its separatist politics and
intolerance of people in general
it will fail to be counted among
these struggles.

Which brings me to the issue
of separatism. Lesbian separa-
tists have run head-on into the
problems encountered by any
group that becomes isolated
from the masses. Intellectual
stagnation sets in. Weaknesses
and conformism prevail. Dogmatism, arrogance, and viciousness
are endemic. Many have
enclosed themselves too tightly,
becoming intolerant of those
“outside.”

I have gone out of my way
to meet lesbians, approaching
them with an open heart and mind,
placing myself in awkward and
vulnerable situations with wom-
en I didn’t know. I’ve sustained
more pain than I’m accustomed
to in the “straight world” and
have been assaulted with a
gamut of assumptions of what
I must think, feel, be, since I am
a lesbian, as well as inane and
insolent judgments against me
when I fail to mimic this model.
Thanks for all the great “nurtur-
ing.” It was just what I needed
to climax a traumatic year of
confronting my homosexuality
alone.

These criticisms are not
directed at all lesbians. But it is
the prevailing nature of what I
have endured. As a movement
you are alienating the more
intelligent, sincere women who
would join you — just the
women, in fact, that you need in
order to diversify and deepen
the movement, the women who
could forge it into the powerful,
progressive spearhead that it
should be.
