Recollections

of

a Farming

Woman

By Maude Shaellow

I watch as the beige colored  
Buick slowly lumbers across the  
outcroppings of ledge in the  
driveway. Four men; two in  
front, two in back, make the low  
slung car heavier yet.

Quickly I rinse plaster dust  
from my hands and face and  
wonder who they are. I know no  
one in this town. Are they  
prospective buyers who have  
failed to notice that the For Sale  
sign is no longer nailed to the  
Maple in the front yard? I run  
my brush through my hair trying  
to get at least some plaster off  
me, expecting a knock any  
minute. Still nothing so I peer  
out the window. They remain in  
the car staring at the house, I go  
out to explain that I am the  
lucky owner of this old farm.

The driver rolls down his  
window as I approach the car.

“Is your father at home?”

I do not explain that my  
father has been dead for ten  
years and I begin to wonder if  
they sell vinyl siding.

“No, my father does not  
live here.”

Searching, the driver looks  
to his companion on the passen-  
ger side, finds no help there and  
stares out the front windshield  
of his car. His eyes light up as he  
sees my truck. Surely that is a  
masculine accessory.

“Is your husband here?”

I match his clipped sen-  
tences.

“No, I am not married.”

This last shred of firm  
ground falls away from his solid  
Vermont feet which I am sure he  
would shift if he were not sitting  
down. I am now trying to stifle  
the grin that I know is creeping  
up the sides of my face. He  
glances in my direction.

“Well ah...”

The springs of the front seat  
squeal in unison with his obvious  
discomfort.

“We're the town select-  
men and we need to talk to the  
man who bought this place.”

“I am the owner.”

The car rocks in place as all  
four twist to accommodate this  
unusual disclosure. The driver,  
since his is the window that is  
rolled down, must deal with  
their dilemma.

“Ya see...”

He pauses as he reaches in a  
pocket for a pen to add to his  
official demeanor, and is handed  
a clipboard by his passengers.

“We've gotta assess the  
property — for taxes.”

He looks at me, unsure that  
I can comprehend “this” high  
finance.

I do not wish to antagonize  
these town fathers. I plan to live  
here a long time and to show  
how cooperative I am going to  
be I smile, but by now they are  
all looking at anything in sight  
but me.

“Would you like to come in  
and look around?”

The reaction is silence and  
another lurch of the car. Finally,  
“No. We'll just ask a few ques-  
tions.”

It has started to rain gently,  
then a little harder and as he  
fingers three sheets of paper I

NEW BOOKS FEATURING  
CLASSIC ANARCHIST AND  
SOCIALIST BOOKS AND  
FEMINIST PAMPHLETS

By Anarcha Femme

Assignment: write a story  
about the softball game, the one  
where the cops came and ordered  
our shirts back on. Snappy  
headlines spring to mind: Scor-  
ching Sunday Sees Sandlot  
Sapphos Sans Shirts.

Well it was the regular game  
I guess. I mean I had a wrestling  
match at second base when the  
second basewoman tackled me  
on my approach to her territory.  
Par for the course or diamond.  
You couldn't strike out and the  
first basewoman might hug you  
in a fit of noncompetitiveness.  
There is something for everyone  
including some high spirited,  
soft-edged competition. The  
only thing different this Sunday  
was that it was so hot women  
began to play shirtless. It be-  
came a trend and soon about  
half the dykes were without  
shirts. The game was going well  
until this cruiser pulled up and  
out comes one officer of the  
law.

Two weeks before a similar  
crowd had been swimming with-  
out wet clothes on their bodies  
and had been approached by a  
Burlington cop and told to be  
clothed. I asked him what the  
charge would be if we did not  
comply; lewd and lascivious? He  
said no, women couldn't be lewd  
and lascivious. I'd always known  
that men had lewd and lascivious  
minds, while women merely had  
their varied and beautiful bodies,  
but I didn’t expect the law to  
see it that way. Of course, they  
don’t; they simply think that  
women can’t do anything power-  
ful, even be L and L.

They do think we'd better  
keep our shirts on though. Well,  
that day we were kinda sick and  
tired of being sick and tired of  
being told to keep our shirts on  
and skirts on and smiles on and  
lids on and so on. So many  
women refused to cooperate  
when this officer of the law  

appeared and commanded us.  
“Why should we put our  
shirts on?”  
Cop: “Cuz I said so.”  
“That's the worst reason I've  
ever heard.”  
“It's the law.”  
“Ditto.”

Cop: “Well, I kinda enjoy  
that.”  
“That’s a good reason to  
put our shirts on.”  
“Why should we wear shirts  
when there’s no one here but  
us?”  
“The neighbors called the  
station.”

Dykes: “Men should wear  
blinders, our bodies are not  
indecently exposed, your mind  
is.” Yeah, indecently exposed,  
disposed to display us only as  
objects to be manipulated in a  
magazine but never to deal with  
the reality of strong women with  
muscles, hair and varied shapes  
using their bodies for their own  
use and pleasure.
