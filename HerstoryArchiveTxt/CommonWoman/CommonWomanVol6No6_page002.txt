Sunday/Monday, Nov. 21/22  
We, the members of Char-  
lotte’s Web, take responsibility  
for the posting of curfew notices  

for men last Friday, Nov. 19. We  

took this action to bring atten-  
tion to the increased incidence  
of rape and the inadequacy of  
the official response, which asks  
women to take responsibility for  

the crime committed by men  

against them by staying home.  
While a curfew might make the  
streets safe, it would make our  
homes even more dangerous  
than they are now (most rape is  
committed in the home by an  
acquaintance).  

Rape is a form of social  
control used against women by  
all men — active rapists and  
“good-guy” protectors. Fear of  
rape forces women to submit to  
one man to gain protection from  
all other men. This “protection  
racket” works to keep women  
dependent on men who benefit  
from our unpaid labor in the

Charlotte’s Web was untan-  
gled for Commonwomon this  
week, when a member of that  
organization contacted one of  
our reporters. This is the report  
she sent:  

I was in Gotham City  
reading the paper and contem-  
plating the Superman complex  
the boys who rule this world  
have, when this spiderwomon  
walked in the door. Halloween  
was over so I was pretty sur-  
prised. She didn't look as though  
she was wearing a costume. Her  
outfit was well worn and she  
looked so natural in it. As if  
sensing my thoughts, she leapt  
over the back of the booth and  
sat down facing me. “Well, Lois  
Lane,” she said, “the web wants  
you.” Great, I thought I can't  
wait to meet these women.  

We walked out to her car  
and when I got in she said,  
“You'll have to go blindfolded  
for this part, we can’t be too  
careful.” I’d guess the drive took  
about forty minutes. Spider-  
womon, who also called herself  
Charlotte, kept me amused with  
stories of the most creative  
revenge the Web has visited upon  
rapists. When the car stopped,  
I was walked along a twisted and  
rocky path, judging from the  
number of times I almost  
tripped. The blindfold was  
removed and I found myself in  
some kind of Bat cave. Charlotte  
said, “I want you to meet Red  
Sonya, she’s in charge of the lab.  
She'll show you what we're  
working on.”  

ATTENTION  

Due to the increased incidence of rape and sexual assault, a 10 p.m.  
CURFEW For All Males is effective immediately upon posting.  
Any male desiring a pass for legitimate reason, call this office:

The introductions  
Same for me, it’s a room that was  
a cross between a lab and a  
witches den. There were herbs  
hanging, chemical compounds,  
pentagrams, crystals and test  
tubes baking over bunsen bur-  
ners. The room had a kitchen  
too.  

“We're serious about this  
project,” Sonya said, “we're  
working on a way to give estro-  
gen to every man in the Penta-  
gon. The world is on the brink  
of total destruction, the Earth is  
almost beyond repair and rape is  
everyday increasing. All of that  
is because there is an excess of  
testosterone. Some of the others  
think environment has more to  
do with it, but we know that too  
much testosterone or too many  
Y chromosomes make patholo-  
gically violent men. It can be  
fixed simply. You have to  
understand, men are slaves to  
raging hormones, that’s why,  
despite the technological pro-  
gress from the club to the  
Hydrogen bomb, the underlying  
psychology is the same. The  
biggest killer gets the goodies,  
elected, appointed, anointed, is  
king of the kill.”  

I couldn't argue with her  
reading of history, certainly  
everyday’s paper proved her  
point. I had one suggestion;  
“Maybe, you could get them to  
take enough marijuana, that  
increases the estrogen level in  
men.” “Too spotty,” she  
replied, “we need something  
specific and fast, we don’t have  
much time left. In fact it’s four  

minutes to midnight, almost the  
witching hour and I have to get  
back to work. You should check  
out the Cat womons program.”  
Sonya picked up a Green  
lantern and led me down a  
narrow passage to another large  
room. In this one, women were  
doing a type of martial art  
but not like any style I'd seen  
before. There were thirty  
women in the room and music  
emanating from four huge shells  
placed around the room. Their  
motions were like belly dancers,  
except for high, leaping kicks  
that brought their knees to the  
level of their foreheads. In  
action, they looked like Indian  
goddesses; Devas with multiple  
arms and legs. Catwomon took  
me aside; “No one can really say  
much about what we do. I can  
tell you that we've evolved the  

fastest, most advanced form of  
self-defense ever. No one has had  
more need to invent it than  
women.” I was feeling as klutzy  
as Clark Kent, standing there  
watching these women, when  
Charlotte appeared and led me  
to yet another room.  

“The Web’s a network,” she  
stated, “intersecting lines, X’s,  
spun spirals,” she pointed to a  
strange diagram. “We support  
each other, primarily by taking  
care of ourselves and that means  
having a little fun. Burlington  
needed a jolt. We saw that you  
women were constantly having  
to picket the police and make  
the point that it’s men, not  
women, who should be kept off  
the streets. They weren’t listen-  
ing though, and you have to do  
it every year. We thought maybe  
we could help, with something

striving for independence, men  
retaliate with rape to crush our  
independence.  
It is not enough for some  
men not to rape. They must  
work to short-circuit the whole  
rape/protection system of male  
dominance, confronting their  
“brothers” on rape, battering,  
child sexual abuse and porno-  
graphy. We don’t want your  
protection — we want you to  

own your responsibility for  
these acts. In the name of  
protection, women have been  

raped and raped again. Men must  

confront each other and disavow  
dominance over women.  

Women must defend them-  
selves. We want free self-defense  
classes for all women in the  
schools and in the community.  
We want hormone therapy for  
violent men. We want men to  
confront each other on the issue  
of rape. We will not give up our  
FREEDOM.  

that would stick in their sieves.”  
“So you came up with the  

curfew?” I asked. “Well, it  
wasn't that simple,” she  
returned. “We had quite a  

debate about tactics in this case.  
A lot of the women wanted  
more direct revenge on the  
rapists themselves. But others  
felt that consciousness raising  
was more important. When a  
rapist is castrated by women the  
media don’t report it and it only  
solves an individual case. We  
figured if men had to read signs  
that curtailed their freedom,  
some thinking might actually get  
done about the overall social  
effect rape has on women. More  
important, the women would  
say right on. So Burlington  
women did and pitched right  

in.” “Nice work,” I patted Char-  
lotte, “but it’s such a drop in the  
bucket, bailing out of a very  
leaky ship.” “It may seem that  
way now Lois, we know the  
male emphasis on quantity is  
another phallacy. You know,  
like who’s got the biggest, whose  
gun has the largest bang. That  
road has led us, as a species, to  
near extinction. In fact the Web  
lists bigger is better as the  
number two phallacy in the list  
of ten prevalent, patriarchal  
phallacies preventing peace and  
positiveness. The first being the  
penchant for splitting everything  
into dualities. We don’t need  
X-Ray vision to see through  
men.” “Is that the Web's official  
position?” I inquired as she  
began leading me out. “Noth-  
ing’s official,” she smiled.
