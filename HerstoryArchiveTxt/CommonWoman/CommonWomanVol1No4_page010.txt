THE GRAND JURY ITSELF IS CONTROLLED
BY THE PROSECUTOR (CA. OR VT.)
WHO MANAGES THE PROCEEDINGS,
BRINGS DOCUMENTS & WITNESSES, DOES
ALL THE QUESTIONING & DRAFTS THE
INDICTMENT WHICH THE JURY APPROVES,
THE JURY'S ONLY LEGAL ADVISOR FOR SECRECY,
THE WITNESS

JURORS, THE
PROSECUTOR,
THE CLERK,
ARE BOUND TO

LIKE OTHER JURIES, GRAND JURORS ARE DRAWN FROM LISTS OF REGI-
STERED VOTERS; POOR, ALIENATED
AND THIRD WORLD PEOPLE ARE
UNDER-REPRESENTED START

HERE ARE TWO KINDS OF FEDERAL

INDICTMENTS: REGULAR GRAND JURIES WHICH MEET
TO CONSIDER CASES INVOLVING FEDERAL OFFENSES

SPECIAL INVESTIGATORY GRAND JURY, WHICH IS THE ONE WE
ARE TALKING ABOUT HERE.

A DEFENDANT GETS DAMN LITTLE FROM
THIS SYSTEM—SHE AND HER LAWYER ARE
EXCLUDED FROM THE JURY ROOM
+ THEY CANNOT CROSS-EXAMINE STATE
WITNESSES OR OBJECT TO QUESTIONS
PUT TO FRIENDLY WITNESSES.

SOME STATES SHE CANNOT APPEAR BE-
FORE A GRAND JURY THAT IS DISCUSSING HER.

IN OTHER STATES SHE CAN TESTIFY ONLY IF
SHE AGREES TO ALLOW THE PROSECUTOR TO
USE ANYTHING SHE SAYS AGAINST HER

AT THE TRIAL.

GRAND JURIES GATHER INFOR-
MATION ON LEFTIST, LESBIAN &
WOMEN'S GROUPS WHO ALLEGEDLY
AIDED & ABETTED UNDERGROUND
FUGITIVES. IN ACTUALITY THIS IS AN
EFFORT TO GAIN PERSONAL INFOR-
MATION ON THE LEFT & THE WOMEN'S
MOVEMENT THROUGHOUT THE US.

Can be used SO

DON’T TALK!

Kristina Berster’s Defense
Committee and lawyers believe

There are two kinds of Federal Grand Juries: regular
and special. In Vermont, there is
a regular Federal Grand Jury
sitting at all times. The current
one was seated this past March.
On Monday, November 27, a
New York attorney was
subpoenaed to appear before the
Vermont Federal Grand Jury.
He was obliged to be in
Burlington on November 30 or
be considered a fugitive. The
subpoena indicates conspiracy
and perjury are being
investigated. There is some
reason to believe there is a
connection between this citizen
and Kristina Berster. Without
further speculation, it is time to

examine and familiarize
ourselves with what a Grand
Jury is.
A BRIEF HISTORY

Grand Juries, or forced
testimony and oaths, are a
survival to present times of the
torture chambers of the Grand
Inquisitions during the European
Middle Ages, when Church and
State together were hunting
witches and religious/political
heretics.

Those accused of heresy were
forced to answer all questions
fully or suffer imprisonment and
torture until they satisfied the
Inquisitor or died. They could
have no attorney; no right to
hear charges against them or
evidence; no right to offer
witnesses or to cross-examine.

Remaining silent was taken as
admitting guilt.

They used faceless
“informers” who never appeared
in person and who replaced the
common law practice of right to
confrontation by open accusers.
The same judges were the
accusers, prosecutors, jury, and
at times, torturer - and
executioner, not to mention
father confessor.

In America, the Grand Jury
was established as part of the
Bill of Rights to protect citizens
against unfair prosecution — it is
empowered to decide whether a
case can be brought against you
— or to investigate official
misconduct — People’s tools if
used correctly; Fascist tools
when not.

Folks fought and died for
over 650 years to win the rights
guaranteed us in the Bill of
Rights, but we must still fight
for these rights to remain alive.
There is a huge gap in our
country between the ideal of
natural and equal rights and the
American history of oppression,
slavery and genocide. Every day
that gap widens.

Today Grand Juries also
collect information about
possible crimes, or just
information in general about
alternative community groups or
remember this little motto:
DON’T TALK!

The calling by the Vermont
Federal Grand Jury of the New
York attorney is an attack on
her. They failed to convict
Kristina or any of her
co-defendants at the trial in
Burlington of any conspiracy.
This could be an attempt to
perpetuate the idea that
“terrorism has come to our
shores” and/or to get back at
Kristina’s defense lawyers who
have put forth a motion to find
the prosecutor, U.S. Attorney
William Gray, guilty of
“contempt of court.” He leaked
information to the press naming
countries that Kristina had been
in. Formerly, it was agreed to
refer to these places only as
Country A and Country B. This
motion has been filed with the
Burlington Federal District
Court, Judge Albert Coffrin still
presiding.
WRAP-UP

Political Grand Juries exist
because of one reason — FEAR.
Those who rule this country are
afraid of the people and what
the people can do. After the
Vietnam mess, Watergate, the
Energy Crisis, Inflation, and
Unemployment, (WHEW), a lot
of folks have more cause to hate
this government than to love it;
many of us have lost trust in
persons who have outspokenly
opposed the status quo.

Currently, feminists in
being harassed in this manner.
“DON'T TALK”

A Grand Jury workshop (the
first in a series) for the purpose
of public education is being
offered in Burlington on
Monday, December 4 at 7:30
p.m. at a location to be
announced. (Watch for
publicity.) It is an attempt to
inform the public about Grand
Juries and what to do in our
own community if the FBI starts
knocking at our doors. There is
no good reason to talk with FBI
agents nor are you legally
obligated to give more than your
name. There is a question as to
whether you legally have to give
even your name if you are not
face to face with an agent, if you
are talking through a closed door,
for example. And talking through a
closed door is desirable if
possible since FBI agents have
sometimes considered an
invitation to come in as a
consent to search. Another
possibility is that you can go out
to say that you do not consent
to speak with the FBI. They
must identify themselves if you
ask who is calling. Don’t fall into
the numerous pitfalls; simply
have become more skeptical
about the workings of our
democracy. Knowing this, the
government responds by acting
against the people — Law and
Order with guns, bombs,
violence, terrorist/communist
by putting some energy into the
anti-nuke alliance here in New
England and nationally; speaking
out against the Mandigo Bill,
which has been defeated but
looms on the legislative horizon
again; and also keeping a
watchful eye on Bill HR-6367
(alias $-1), which is still around
and about to rehatch under still
another new name. Kristina
Berster’s case as well questions a
West German democratic
government that is repressive.
Instead of solving problems,
the government ignores them
and fights those of us who cry
for change and that means more:
Sexism Racism Ageism Poverty
Pollution Violence and (shhh)
RESISTANCE
R—E—S—I—S—T—A—N—C—E!!!
