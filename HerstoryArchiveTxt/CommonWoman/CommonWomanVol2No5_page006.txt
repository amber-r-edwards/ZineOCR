By Linda Gwizdak  
On May 5, The Southern

Vermont Lesbian/Gay Men

Coalition sponsored a planning  
conference to plan Northern  
New England’s participation in  
the October 14 Lesbian and Gay  
People’s March on Washington,  
D.C.

The conference was sche-  
duled to be held at the Andrews  
Inn in Bellows Falls. On May 2,  
a group of “concerned citizens”  
of Bellows Falls decided to  
protest the conference. About  
200 people showed up at the  
meeting and they decided to  
picket the Inn on Saturday  
morning. Some of the local  
people were upset at the allega-  
tions of a writer for the gay-male  
magazine, Blueboy. The article  
said that Bellows Falls was a  
“haven for homosexuals” and  
that the small village could  
become another Provincetown.

However, prior to the Wed-  
nesday night meeting of the  
citizens, the conference site had  
been changed to a private home  
in Brattleboro because so few  
people registered and the large  

space at the Inn was no longer —  

needed.

On Saturday, the “con-  
cerned citizens” marched. There  
were about 80 marchers. They  
marched silently behind a pick-  
up truck that bore a banner  
reading, “We Protest the Sland-  
ering of Bellows Falls by  
Gays!” People carried placards  
saying, “Gays Stay Away From  
Bellows Falls!”, “We Want  
Bellows Falls To Be Happy —  
Not Gay!”

A number of town officials  
and clergy opposed the march  
since Bellows Falls has a “live  
and let live” philosophy.

A group called the Church  
of the Living Word, from Clare-  
mont, N.H., went to Bellows  
Falls on May 8 to protest the  
stance of the local clergy. This  
demonstration of 100 chanting,  
horn-blowing, noisy people  
called for the “deliverance” of  
Bellows Falls from the gays.  
Some of their placards read,  
“Christ’s Authority Brings Deli-  
verance!” and “Release Bellows  
Falls!”

Meanwhile, 15 people  
gathered at the conference and  
the atmosphere was relaxed and  
productive. People represented  
Montpelier, Burlington, Brattle-  
boro area, and New Hampshire.  
The Maine delegates were unable  

to attend. Two people who  

represented the N.Y.C.-based  
National March office came to  
fill us in on what was happening  
nationwide. They told us that  
things were moving along and  
that there was activity in all 50  
states! We all felt that the  
Bellows Falls incident helped us  
more than hurt us. The press and  
many citizens seemed to be in  
our favor. The National March  
office people were pleased with  
the rural activity.

During the conference, we  
discussed the past week’s hap-  
penings. We gave reports on  
activities in our own local areas  
and we divided the region into  
four areas. Each area will send a  
delegate to the national confer-  
ence to be held in Houston this  
summer. The areas are: Vermont  
and the entire Connecticut River  
Valley, New Hampshire, South-  
ern and Coastal Maine, and  
Northern Maine.

We discussed reasons for  
having the March — why we  
should or shouldn't have it.  
Some groups were reluctant to  
oppose or “upset” the politi-  
cians. Others felt that the  
national Gay community didn’t  
have its act together enough for  
a really good turnout at the  
March. Many believe that now’s  
the time to come out to show  
the world that we exist and that  
we should show ourselves proud-  
ly at the March. We also dis-  
cussed the demands of the  
March. The following is the list  
of demands that was drawn up  
at the February meeting in  
Philadelphia.

STATEMENT OF PURPOSE

End all social, economic,  
judicial, and legal oppression of  
Lesbian/Gay people.

Valium

Doctors in Great Britain  
have found a greater incidence  
of breast cancer in women who  
take the tranquilizer Valium.  
They injected rats which had  
breast tumors with the equiva-  
lent of the normal dosage taken  
by Valium users. The tumors  
developed into cancer and not  
only grew much faster but much  
larger than those tumors in the  
undosed rats. The G.B. doctors  
feel much more research on this  
needs to be done.

This was told by a scientist  
on a Canadian television channel  
who had confirmed, in a very  
small way, the findings of the  

G.B. doctors: He applied to the  
Canadian Government for a  
grant to study this in more  
detail, to find out not only why  
this happens, but how. The  
Canadian Government refused.

The Canadian television  
show host said he could not  
understand, since breast cancer  
in women is now the most  
common cause of death, and  
Valium the most commonly  
used drug, why this request was  
refused, and the scientist said  
perhaps that government simply  
did not approve of the particular  
laboratory for which he works.

FEATURES FEATURES

I. on Gay Rights

(1) Repeal all anti-Gay/Les-  
bian laws.

(2) Pass a comprehensive  
Lesbian/Gay Rights Bill in Con-  
gress.

(3) Presidential Executive  
Order banning discrimination  
based on sexual preference in  
the Federal Government and  
federally contracted employ-  
ment.

(4) Non-discrimination in  
Lesbian mother/Gay father child  
custody cases.

(5) Full rights for Gay  
youth, including revision of the  
“age of consent” laws. (The  
Wimmin’s Caucus voiced opposi-  
tion to this demand and they're  
working with the Youth Caucus  
to come up with a mutually  
agreeable solution.)

(6) End discrimination with-  
in the Armed Forces.

We discussed Demand 5 at  
length. Wimmin opposed this  
demand because the present laws  
are the only protection that  
young people have against sexual  

rights for Gay  

coercion by older authority  
figures (adults). This law mainly  
protects young girls from men.  
Our conference rewrote the  
demand to read, “Protect and  
support Gay youth against  
harassment in the home, school,  
work, and social environment.”  
The conference decided to either  
use the revised version of the  
demand or vote to scrap all of  
the demands and keep the  
Statement of Purpose.

One participant brought up  
the topic of dealing with the  
ROOT CAUSES of Gay and  
wimmin’s oppression. People are  
reluctant to deal with the  
patriarchal, or male-run, system,  
capitalism, authoritarianism, and  
heterosexual privilege; some Gay  
men and most non-Gay wimmin  
benefit from “not rocking the  
boat.” I only wish that we had  
the time and space to really deal  
with this very important issue.  
We have got to stop putting  
“band-aids” on the problem and  
dig out the real causes of our  

oppression — Patriarchy. This  
merits a lot of thought and  
ACTION!

Another issue that wasn’t  
really dealt with is the issue of  
non-violence training — the same  
type of training that the Clam-  
shells use at their anti-nuke  
demonstrations. As a result of  
the recent attacks on Gay men  
at the national anti-nuke demon-  
stration, I feel that this issue  
MUST be discussed and that we  
train ourselves. We cannot ignore  
the fact that we could come  
under attack at our March and  
we must be emotionally and  
physically ready.

We want to make a good  
Vermont showing in Washing-  
ton, D.C., in October. Right  
now, we need money, energy  
and endorsements. Some fund-  
raising ideas could be dances,  
raffles, car washes, etc. The  
money raised will be used to  
help low-income people with the
