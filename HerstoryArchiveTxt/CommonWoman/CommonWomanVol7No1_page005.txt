masturbation

Masturbation Song  
Traditional folk song  
Sing to tune of “Funiculi Funicula”

Last night when I got home I masturbated

It felt so good — I knew it would

Last night when I got home I masturbated

It felt so neat — I used my feet.

Oh You should have seen me on the long strokes

It felt so grand — I used my hand

Oh You should have seen me on the short strokes

It felt so neat — I used my feet

Thrashing Crashing Rolling on the floor

Sliding down the bannister and humping on the door

Some people say that you'll get warts

Or go insane  
Or some such fate But

I can hardly wait ’till I get home to masturbate.

dykes’ delight

I wanna suck on your tongue  
till it makes me come

wanna lick your skin

suck your nipples

I want this fire turned to  
wet, slippery water

want your fingers sliding in and out

want to feel you inside  
feel you getting wetter  
saliva on my tongue  
drinking you — want your smells  
cunt juice, sweet and pungent  
want it to stay:  
on my fingers all day  
want my face between your legs  
want your cunt in my mouth  
my tongue likes your asshole  
your tongue makes me shiver  
quiver  
end of my spine is shaking  
quaking  
my knees collapse and you  
follow me there  
our tongues slide into each  
other, down our bodies  
licking, sucking at breast  
nipple, navel, along thighs  
lapping up  
licking clit  
wetness on my face  
your tongue slides inside  
I melt, come  
in waves coming  
down from hot uterus  
my clit taken up by your tongue  
my body arches towards yours  
you are in my mouth  
my tongue tracing the  
edges of your clitoris  
darting inside  
I lick the hair away  
press my mouth open  
against you gently  
suck, draw you into my mouth  
then touch tip of clit  
with tip of tongue  
fluttering, sucking  
holding, kissing you here  
my fingers inside....  
you rise up, vagina contracts  
you yell, come,  
my tongue still wants you

I climb your body, holding each other

kissing, moaning la la la, lah  
ah mmnnn hmnn

SOLA SEX

The deadline for Com-  
monwomon approaches and I  
am procrastinating. I gravitate  
toward my old journals, seeking  
out writing already done, back  
from when I was “in love.”  
That's what I should put in the  
sex issue I think. Well, maybe —  
but what about sex from these  
years not in love?

I filled journals back then...  
writing about romance, making  
love, fantasy, letting go, jea-  
lousy, rejection... my relation-  
ship chronicles, these old jour-  
nals. I wish I had my “sola”  
chronicles, but while love gets  
me to fill journals, being alone  
lends itself toward reading books  
and taking walks.

And masturbating, I could  
write about that.

I came out almost seven  
years ago and have been in three  
pretty consecutive, focused,  
lover relationships. They over-  
lapped some — only one of them  
was monogamous, and that for  
only part of the time. I have  
made love with a number of  
womyn, with varying amounts  
of “relationship” involved. After  
the last “main one” broke up  
about 2½ years ago, I shut down  
pretty much and took a break. I  
needed to figure some things  
out, center, and get back to  
myself.

I can honestly say my sex  
life has improved tremendously  
in some ways since I've been  
(mostly) alone. Years of getting  
to know my moods independent  
of another's, recognizing what  
(other than HER) turns me on,  
and exploring freely (without  
worrying how she'd react or  
with getting up my nerve to tell  
her) how I like to be touched.

Granted, there are some  
limitations to what I can do (I  
still wish I could reach my cunt  
with my mouth), but overall I  
find myself much looser and  
open after all this time of getting  
it on with myself. It should be  
noted that I live alone and out  
in the country. So I can make a lot  
of noise, which I’ve been doing  
more and more.

There was a time, in the  
beginning of sola (not celibate,  
mind you) that I wasn’t feeling  
sexual at all. As that changed,  
but my aloneness didn’t, I made  
love more with myself. Sometimes  
“just” because I wanted to  
orgasm, and sometimes because  
I felt really turned on, and truly  
like making love with myself  
“foreplay” and all.

I like what they call fore-  
play. I like it a lot, and I’m  
learning to like it with myself  
too. Touching my breasts, the  
inside of my legs, my belly —  
not to get “aroused” for orgasm  
(but sometimes only for this),  
but because it feels good.

I’ve masturbated regularly  
since I was a young girl. I had  
my first orgasms at about 6 on  
the seat of a bike, later with my  
hand, or various vegetables (to  
see what fucking would be like).  
I remember trying to keep the  
sheets from making noise in the  
shared bedroom... I learned  
years later that my sister had the  
same frustration. I masturbated  
with my fingers inside and with  
only indirect pressure of my  
clitoris. Sometimes now I touch  
my clitoris directly, or I do it  
“the old way,” or I experiment.  
I like touching my anus some-  
times, (when I’m especially  
turned on) or a little inside my  
ass, while touching inside my

cunt with the other hand. I can  
do these things — unself-  
consciously and passionately —  
and quite noisily — when I’m  
alone. I’ve found out that my  
orgasms can last a long time, 'cause  
I continue to touch myself  
(more gently and slowly) after I  
first “come,” something many  
lovers don’t do, and many  
womyn don’t want. I discovered  
that it feels really good.

A recent joy, and why this  
is on my mind in the first place,  
is that I’m finding that I’m not  
only looser when I’m masturba-  
ting, but when I’m making love  
with someone else. I guess I  
hadn't realized how noisy I’ve  
become, or how intense and long  
my orgasms can be, until this  
recent lovemaking opening with  
a lover. I was surprised — and a  
little embarrassed at first. Used  
to the woods and myself, I’m  
louder and more indulgent than  
most times before.

Masturbating, and reading,  
have liberated my ideas of how  
I feel and what I want a lot. I've  
tried many different ways of  
touching myself and with differ-  
ent intensities, and I've dis-  
covered — some through explor-  
ing fantasy — that I like a wide  
variety of touches and energies,  
from gentle and slow to wild and  
powerful. What’s nice is I usually  
know what I want, and when  
I don't I'm not afraid to try  
different things... with myself.  
Usually I don't bore myself;  
these days anyway.

What I want to do is carry  
over my discoveries to making  
love with other womyn; to  
verbalize what I like and want,  
and to trust that it's fine. I  
believe that I’m responsible for  
my own good time sexually, and  
I want to move towards sharing  
what I've found out with myself  
with the womyn that I make  
love with.
