CUMMONWOMAN DECEMBER 1980

By Linda Wittenberg  
These things are real: The  
election results this year dealt a  
serious blow to liberation move-  
ments in the United States,  
Central and South America, and  
around the world. The rise in  
right wing control will mean  
increased military spending, and  
increasing military aid to govern-  
mental regimes protecting “U.S.  
interests” (meaning the interests  
of the multinational corporations)  
abroad. Within the U.S. it  
will mean more repression of  
poor and Third World peoples,  
women, gays. It will mean a  
sanctioning of the mentality, the  
ideology and violence of the  
KKK and the Neo-Nazis.  
Watching Americans young  
and old salute Ronald Reagan on  
the night of the election I felt  
like I was watching German  
people salute Hitler — and on  
the day following, with the news  
screaming ‘REAGAN LAND-  

RESISTANCE!  

SLIDE VICTORY’, I imagined  
everyone I saw an enemy... as a  
Jew, as a woman, as a lesbian.  

We're really susceptible to  
media images which are often  
not only interpretations of the  
news, but the makers of public  
opinion. The results were bad,  
but the reporting of Reagan's  
win as a “mandate from the  
people” (his 26 percent of the  
voting age public) is the kind of  
manipulation of the facts that’s  
bound to have its effects on our  
minds and spirits. As sure as the  
right wing is financing/controlling  
the media coverage of the 80's,  
we will be, as radicals and  
political people, programmed to  
despair. We must sift the  
real threats with our guts, while  
the media tries to control  
our reactions — fear Russians,  
hate Iranians; the increased  
threat to us of a right wing  
controlled Congress is very real.  
We must realistically prepare  
for resistance to an even more  
repressive government.  

We must not buy the ‘news’  
that most Americans want an  
America run by right wing  
thinking. Although this is a  
representative government, most  
people feel that they can’t be  
heard, that there’s nothing they  
can do to make change, stop  
destruction of the planet, pro-  
test a war in the mid-east, or  
corruption in government. Many  
people are struggling, fighting to  
survive. “You can’t fight city  
hall” sounds familiar, but you  
must fight when you (a people, a  
planet) have no other survival  
choice. We all, who are oppress-  
ed and who see oppression, need  
to be resistors. We need to make  
resistance an accessible concept.  
We must take away the “I can't  
do anything about it” attitude  
by sharing, repeating and  
recounting our resistances often  
and aloud — recognizing that  
resistance has as long a history as  
repression, and that resisters are  
survivors. Vietnam, Nicaragua,  
Zimbabwe, Blacks, Jews, Native  
Americans.  

Everyone can do it. Resis-  
tance is not just a march or a  
demonstration. Resistance is a  
bumper sticker, a political but-  
ton, boycotting Nestlé, saying  
"No," speaking out, staying  
informed and educated, refusing  
to get a computerized bank card,  
or credit card, questioning  
authority, reading Common  
Woman. Resistance is surviving  
when you are meant to be a  
victim — a daily choice; it’s in  
my blood as a Jew, a lesbian, a  
woman, a seamstress.  

We need to read, and hear,  
and see the news (check your  
alternative media) of resistances  
small and large to know that  
people struggle and gain. Resis-  

tance is a rising tide; our  
struggles add to each others’  
strengths. Each individual act of  
resistance is personally liberat-  
ing; I feel relieved, I feel em-  
powered, I feel more alive for  
having stood up, fought back.  
Many acts of resistance are a  
movement, liberate a people.  
RESIST, RESISTANCE,  
BECOME THE RESISTANCE!  

around the world. In Burlington,  
they make primarily the Vulcan  
gun, a rapid-fire automatic weap-  
on that fires 6000 rounds a  
minute. One sign at the demon-  
stration read, “Who does the  
Vulcan kill?”  

On November 17 we were  
protesting male violence and  
capitalist greed which have esca-  
lated the arms race to the point  
where even the government's  
own organs (in this case, the  
Manhattan project) say we have  
less than a 40% chance of  
surviving to the 21st century.  
Like the women in D.C., we see  
a need for true equality and  
human (FEMINIST!) values, not  
more devastation in Washington, and have ever more overkill. What insane  
disconnection is it in men that  
makes them strive for the  
greatest hoard of death  
machines? Why do we let a few  
white men risk all our lives, for  
their greater profit and warrior  
satisfaction? In their alienation  
from life, they can only mass  
produce phallic testimony to  
their existence, in the form of  
new missiles erected at us, a rape  

of all life.  

At G.E. we tried to alert  
workers to the fact that there  
exist other possibilities besides  
making arms. Conversion to  
peaceful industry — and we  
don't mean just more toasters,  
but housing and public transpor-  
tation and solar equipment and  
the like — would employ more  
people. Military industries  
employ mostly high-paid white  
men, as engineers, scientists,  
researchers, etc. Military spend-  
ing causes inflation, being a  
capital-intensive business that  
does not make goods consumers  
can buy.  

The Women’s Party for  
Survival is calling a boycott of  
General Electric products. We  
urge all people to let stores and  
G.E. management know that  
they do not have the support of  
consumers. We have power and a  
voice. Say “no!” loudly to the  
unspeakable male violence that  
is killing us and others, world-  
wide. G.E., stop projecting your  
phallic weaponry at us! Women  
unite!
