Last month a group of  
women met to discuss the  
subject of women battering  
women. The group included  

several women who work at the  
shelter for battered women in  
Burlington. The meeting was  
unstructured — it was a begin-  
ning, an opening of the subject  
with the hope of establishing  
resources that can help lesbians  
in battering situations.  

We began by trying to  
define battering. A woman who  
had been battered by another  
woman said that it had happen-  
ed over and over before she  
could recognize it as battering  
because she thought of battering  
as something men do to women.  

Relationships between  
women are considered more  
equal (physically, emotionally  
and economically) in general,  
than relationships between  

women and men. This idea of  
equality carried over to the  
discussion of women battering  
women — the question of  
whether both women are parti-  
cipating in the violence — the  
question of when there is a  
clear-cut victim.  

Opinion differed over whe-  
ther psychological battering is as  
harmful and dangerous as physi-  
cal battering and, related to this,  
if violence is justified if it is  

provoked by psychological  
abuse. Also, there was the  
question of violence used in  
response to violence — whether  
this created an “equal” and,  
thus, not a battering situation.  

The group’s general defini-  
tion of battering (although  
everyone did not exactly agree)  
involved a situation where: one  
person doesn’t want it to hap-  
pen, where there is fear involved  
for one person, where one  
person is the aggressor, where  
there is a repetition of the  
violence.  

In discussing battering, we  
are describing a syndrome, not  
an isolated event. Two people  
are in a situation, living daily in  

The conference on lesbian  
battering of the National Coali-  
tion Against Domestic Violence  
Lesbian Caucus met in Washing-  
ton, D.C. on September 17, 18,  

and 19, 1983, agreed to the  
following statements regarding  
lesbian battering, and deter-  
mined to make and distribute  
this statement to the lesbian  
nation.  

FIRST: Lesbian battering is  
a very serious problem. The  
incidence of such violence is not  
presently known but we do  
know that numbers of lesbians  
have called the battered  
women’s services seeking help.  
The fact that it exists is suffi-  
cient reason for us to mobilize  
all of the resources of the lesbian  
nation to end this violence  
against women.  

SECOND: Lesbian battering  

Battering Among Women  

is as serious as heterosexual  
battering. Physical, sexual and  
emotional violence is unaccep-  
table in our community.  

THIRD: Lesbian violence  
cuts across racial, socio-econo-  
mic, political and cultural lines  
and lifestyles.  

FOURTH: The lesbian  
community must find ways to  
uncover and intervene in batter-  
ing relationships; to hold the  
batterer accountable for her  
behavior; and to stop it.  

FIFTH: We expect the  
battered women’s services to  
begin to address this problem,  
first by confronting homophobia  
in the movement. We intend to  
communicate directly with these  
groups on how to provide safety  

for battered lesbians.  
SIXTH: We charge the les-  

bian community with developing  
and maintaining a political ana-  
lysis that includes the following:  

(1) Provide the battered  
lesbian with at least as much  
support as other victims of  
violence;  

(2) Provide safe space for a  
battered lesbian to tell her story,  
seek help and get validation.  

(3) Hold the batterer  
accountable for her behavior by  
confrontation and if the violence  
does not end, the community  
must take responsibility for  
further action.  

(4) Cease blaming the victim  
in the following specific ways:  
(a) putting the responsibility for  
division within the community  

on the perpetrator of the vio-  
lence; (b) denying the battered  
lesbian’s reality; (c) confusing  

self-defense with battering; (d)  
labeling battering “mutual  
abuse;” (e) stop putting respon-  
sibility on the victim to end the  
violence; (f) asserting that no  
language is provocation or justi-  
fication for physical violence.  

SEVENTH: Give the  
battered lesbian free choice  
around confronting her batterer  
(do not coerce her to reconcile).  

EIGHTH: Violence is not a  
“potential” in ourselves; it is a  
behavioral choice.  

NINTH: Battered lesbians  
demand validation and safety,  
not sympathy and not a should-  
er to cry on.  

Here is a checklist that  
women can use to examine their  
relationship to assure themselves  
that they are non-violent: (1)  
Use of power (physical and  
emotional) to control or domi-  
nate one’s partner; (2) Humiliat-  

Page 5  

ing or degrading acts perpetrated  
by one person on another; (3)  
The acting out of historically  
violent roles (racism, anti-  
semitism, homophobia, miso-  
gyny); (4) Infliction of bodily  
injury; (5) Forced or coerced  
sexual activity of any kind.  

We as leaders of the batter-  
ed women’s movement are seri-  
ously concerned that we have  
received reports from lesbians  
involved in sado-masochistic  
relationships that the relation-  
ship moved into battering, or in  
retrospect always was battering.  
We ask that lesbians engaging in  
sado-masochistic behavior care-  
fully examine the nature of  
consent since it is our experience  
as advocates for battered women  
that in any relationship that  
involves violent activity, the  
lines between consent, compliance  
and coercion tend to blur.
