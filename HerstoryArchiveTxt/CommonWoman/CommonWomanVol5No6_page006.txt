lie detector  
Bae. ig that the job had  

By Sandy Baird  

We women all have a bit of  
the hooker in us. We have to  
please men sexually in a world  
where they control the purse  
strings. That’s why the State’s  
Attorney’s actions lately in  
arresting alleged prostitutes is  
hard to understand, especially  
given the facts that there are more  
important things for him to do  
than harassing girls who are  
simply being more direct than  
the rest of us in making a buck,  
and especially when we’re in the  
middle of a recession when such  
activity is bound to increase.  

Think about what all  
women have to do to get along,  
even in normal economic times.  
Most of us are not in professions  
where minds are somewhat  
valued. Although the Women’s  
Liberation Movement has forced  
some integration into the pro-  
fessions and although most cor-  
porate boards have their token  
woman, few females have lucra-  
tive or powerful jobs. Besides,  

In response to the arrest,  
recently in Burlington, of four  
women allegedly involved in an  
“escort service/prostitute ring,”  
women have demonstrated, writ-  
ten letters, spoken on radio, and  
talked with each other. Our  
anger stems from the fact that  
the names, addresses and per-  
sonal lives of the four women  
were immediately and repeated-  
ly in the media, while the men,  
“johns” who made the service  
(also run by a man) a feasible  
business, are protected from any  
incrimination. A book contain-  
ing names of the men clients is  
in the custody of the state's  
attorney, Mark Keller, who has  
not released any of the names.  
Charges were dropped against  
one of the four women when a  

test proved she had  
nothing to do with prostitu-  
tion. Common woman asked a  
group of women to meet and  
discuss the many issues this  
incident raises. The following  
dialogue is a transcribed version  
of parts of the conversation.  

Lynn: Well, one issue we  
have with this specific case is the  
double standard, women treated  
more exploitively than the men.  

Michiyo: If it's a crime and  
they publish the women’s names  
they should publish the johns’  
names and make it even-handed.  

Lynn: I keep thinking of  
the drug laws; whoever buys is as  
guilty as whoever sells.  

We Are All Hookers  

even professional women know  
the value of being sexually  
pleasing to men. Like all  
females, they smile at bosses and  
clients, flatter, flirt, and do  
anything but be considered an  
aggressive, hostile, i.e. non-  
sexually pleasing ball buster.  

And if the economically  
freest women flutter their eye-  
lashes, think what the rest of us  
have to do in the marketplace.  

Waitresses, for instance,  
although underpaid, under-  
valued, and overworked, not  

only have to put up with enor-  
mous amounts of abuse, but also  
have to smile about it. When  
men pat them, grab them,  
drunkenly leer at them, can they  
utter the proper pejorative, drop  
dead? Not on your life. They  
grin and bear it, convincing their  
customers that they are alluring  
males and that their sexual  
advances are flattering.  

Or consider secretaries. As is  
true of waitresses, secretaries are  
underpaid, enormously skilled,  

Pam: Yes, the Vermont  
statute is actually clear that it’s  
the same crime for the man as  
for the woman.  

Peg: Then what was the  
legal basis for what happened?  

Pam: It was up to Keller to  
tell the police how to break the  
ring. He chose the technique of  
setting up the women with fake  
johns. He could've gotten the  
women to turn state's evidence  
and go in and bust the clients.  
They decided to do it this way,  
where only the women and  
Ward (the pimp) would be  
arrested. They chose the easiest  
way.  
Michiyo: They're settling  
for getting the suppliers and  
forgetting about those who  
make the demand.  

Lynn: Keller says he can’t  
release the names in the book  
because they're potential clients,  
not definite. But I think Ward’s  
book is probably clear in listing  
actual from potential customers.  

Pam: It’s also true that the  
women could identify the men  
by looks if not by name.  

Michiyo: But who’s gonna  
put “respectable businessmen”  
in a lineup?  

Pam: Again, it’s a choice of  
tactics.  

Peg: The fact that the priest  
called up is a riot; it fits in  
exactly with my picture of the  
justice system and the church  
and prostitution. A priest called  
up Keller and said, “Please don't  

and undervalued. Can you ima-  
gine what would happen, for  
instance, if secretaries struck?  
But even though they keep our  
economy going, typing their  
fingers to callouses, driving  
themselves crazy taking down  
their bosses’ words in shorthand,  
they are held in esteem more for  
their legs, smiles, coffee-making  
abilities, in short their capacities  
for turning the boss on, than for  
their skills.  

And what about the non-  
paying roles women have, the  
wife and mother job? As respect-  
able as they are, as worthy of  
Mother’s Day cards, they too  
share qualities of the hooker.  
The wife, after all, trades her  
body for support. From bearing  
children, to caring for them, to  

tending a husband and doling  
out sex to him in return for  
financial security, the legal Mrs.  
has a sister in the illegal prosti-  
tute, who does the same thing  
only in a more streamlined  
fashion, with better pay and  

Round Table: Prostitution  

release the names of those men,  
think of their families.”  
Michiyo: And the women  
have already been hurt.  
Pam: I keep coming back to  
the economic source of prostitu-  
tion. I think it’s ironic that  

there’s a union drive going on  
downtown with the retail work-  
ers, 95% are female. The press  
keeps saying 4 of these “johns”  
are downtown businessmen. It’s  
an interesting thing that they're  
also the ones holding back these  
women workers. The same men  
who are exploiting the retail  
workers are utilizing prostitu-  
tion. There’s an interesting con-  
nection there.  

Peg: The lead article in  
Sinister Wisdom this month is  
taken from a new book Women’s  
Worth by Lisa Leghorn and  
Cathy Parker. It says that  
women do about 2/3 of the  
world’s productive work. All  
over the world there’s an incre-  
dible commonality that is un-  
paid work that women do.  
George Gilder’s book, the bible  
of Reagonomics, is totally  
directed against women getting  
anything, especially being in the  
marketplace. They know we're  
the basis of the surplus wealth,  
but they do everything to keep  
women from knowing it. Mostly  
by the myth of romantic love.  

Pam: Of the three women  
on the police record, one is a  
nurse’s aide, one is a cook's aide  
and the third (can’t remember)  

hours. The welfare mother too  
gets paid for her sexual services  
though not as well as any of the  
above. For producing children,  
the State keeps her and her kids  
in groceries, barely it’s true, but  
it and the men who run govern-  
ment bureaucracy pay women  
without men for sexual inter-  
course. While in the case of the  
welfare mother it is an act which  
produces offspring, unlike the  
hooker, it is the same act,  
screwing, in both cases which is  
paid.  

So why all the fuss for four  
girls who were hired as escorts,  
and who may have done more?  
What's a girl to do, especially  
when the economic mood these  
days is so bad for women, when  
our President expresses his deter-  
mination to keep women from  
our boardrooms and professions  
by opposing the ERA, when the  
recession has eradicated jobs for  
marginal workers, many of  

whom are women and many of  
whom are Black women who,  
regardless of  

the name for  

was similar. One of the women is  
the sole supporter of her family.  
It’s pretty clear how they got  
involved.  

Michiyo: I’ve thought about  
being a prostitute. The only  
thing that keeps me from doing  
it is the emotional price you pay  
and the fact that I could lose my  
daughter. But I’ve been hungry a  
lot, and the jobs that I can get  
pay shit, and they don't get me  
off welfare, even when I'm  
working full time. In some ways  
you can think of prostitution as  
quick easy money, but it’s not  
so quick or easy.  

Pam: I think for the women  
who got involved in the escort  
service it was never up front that  
the job would demand sexual  
“favors.” Ward did slick adver-  
tising; you'd get paid $10 an  
hour to go on dates.  

Lynn: It infuriates me even  
more that the men involved  
could get off free when I hear,  
repeatedly, that the women were  

pressured with arm-bending  
techniques.  

Peg: I wonder why they  
bother to keep prostitution  

illegal. The way the law in fact  
works is bullshit. In Washington  
there’s a red light district and  
there’s always been prostitutes  
there; they’ve never gotten more  
than light fines or possibly  
overnight in jail; but now with  
gentrification (rich people fancy-  
ing up old neighborhoods) going  
on and white people from the  
suburbs moving in, the women  

prostitution, White Slavery, are  
too forced to be hookers, when  
welfare slashes are forcing us and  
our children into hunger, and  
when marriage itself is jeopar-  
dized by financial strains?  

Women must and will sur-  
vive, and to do that we have to  
keep on the favorable side of  
men. That’s a truth all women  
understand, and our law-enforce-  
ment officials better get hip to  
before they intrude into places  
they have no business going, into  
our hotel rooms, bedrooms and  
offices, and by their intrusions  
earn our wrath by making us see  
the truth and potential power of  
our positions in a world where  
men’s dominance over money  
determines that we, secretary or  
waitress, mother or hooker, are  
sisters,  

are going to jail for weeks and  
months.  

Michiyo: It’s a whole hypo-  
crisy. If it’s lower class “scum”  
living there they don’t care if  
prostitutes are around; once it  
starts getting “nicer” and more  
white people, more middle-class  
people, then it’s like oh we can't  
have this...  

Peg: (one woman who  
knows told me) there’s a whole  
lot of prostitution at the Radis-  
son.  

Lynn: I think if prostitution  
were legal, women would need  
less money to buy favors to  
protect themselves. Maybe they  
could afford to set up houses  
and be their own bosses.  

Peg: I just think pimping  
should be illegal.  

Pam: I'm just afraid if we  
talk about that end of it, it’ll  
only focus on keeping large  
numbers of women in prostitu-  
tion as they already are. I’d  
rather put energy into changing  
the situation for those women,  
so they have choices. I’m not  
laying any trip on them saying I  
should rescue you so you don’t  
have to prostitute. But from  
what little I know women get  
into it because they're desperate,  
it’s not a first choice. That’s  
romanticizing it, the high class  
call girl thing.  

Michiyo: They need the  
money. It’s a question of how  
you can get your basic needs  
met.
