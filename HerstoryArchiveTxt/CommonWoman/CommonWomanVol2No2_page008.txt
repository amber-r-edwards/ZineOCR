CENTERING

Dear Readers...

Sexism in Burlington is pervasive. Lynn Vera and I took a
trip around town one Saturday afternoon in February with a
camera. Keeping our feminist eyeballs peeled, we discovered that,
sure enough, displaying women’s bodies, making fun of women's
bodies, degrading women’s bodies, keeps our economy on the
move.

Here are samples of that great American standard of female
beauty. Note the restricting clothes, the pounds of heavy hair, the
silly postures, the come hither looks inviting (most certainly)
men to take what they want. Included also are samples of
messages promoting male dominance.

And finally, I mixed in photos of communication from the
other side — angry women fed up with female oppression.

Yours truly,
Carol E. Cohen
