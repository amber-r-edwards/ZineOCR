g Black women are organizing

Zto protect themselves. Among  
other things, they have formed  
% “safe house” networks which  
S allow women to check up on each  
other, leafletted their communi-  
ties to educate others about the  
dangers they face, and held free  
self-defense classes. One com-  
munity outreach program has  
established a 24-hour hotline  
and an African Security Patrol  
System, a start at self-protection  
in the Black community. At the  
Solomon Carter Fuller Mental  
Health Center, education about  
sexual assault is an ongoing  
means of exchanging street in-  
formation and raising conscious-  
ness about our role as victims.  
Much of what we can do, at  
least initially, is preventative.  
Walking with other women, call-  
ing ahead to let people know  
you are coming, wearing clothes  
you can run and fight in, are just  
a few examples. Considering that  
one out of three women in this  
country will be raped in her  
lifetime, that a woman is batter-  
ed in the U.S. every 18 seconds,  
and that nine out of ten women  
report sexual harassment on the  
job, it is time we actively defend  
ourselves. Perhaps it is time to  
reevaluate the use of weapons  
and rethink our stance on  
violence, rather than continue to  
accept these deaths and our own  
fear of being assaulted, raped or  

murdered.  
We must reflect on what it

and abuse these poisons, as do  
men. The government's choice  
of focus on women here is a  
poorly disguised attempt to  
impose an old double standard —  
one which chains women in the  
maternal role as needing to be  
the more responsible adult  
‘because the health and well  
being of the children rests with  
them. Mothers are all too often  
blamed for their children’s ail-  
ments — psychological and phy-  
sical. It is impossible to believe  
a government's concern here,  
when their backs are turned to  
‘the overwhelming experimentation  
on women’s bodies by a  
medical establishment which  
metes out pregnancy and anti-  
pregnancy drugs indiscriminately  
and without ample testing.  
These drugs damage and have  
damaged the bodies of unborn  
children.  

It is important to remember  
when thinking about alcohol and  
its effect upon children that  
alcohol is a major contributing  
factor in wife abuse, and that it  
is often pregnant women who  

are beaten. This is a hazard to  

those unborn children. Let's see  
alcohol bottles labelled with a  
caution to men that it may cause  
them to beat their wives and  
harm their children. Let's see the  
government acknowledge that  
men as well as their pregnant  
wives should not drink.  

Allowing men their vices  
(boys will be boys) while censur-  
ing women is an attempt to  
re-enforce separate moralities for  
men and for women — we must  
sift the ‘paternalistic morality  
messages from the information  
we need for survival and under-  
stand that that sifting is a  
survival tactic as well.  

means that, as Ellen Willis said in  
1968, “Men don't take us  
seriously because they are not  
physically afraid of us.” Men  
rape, batter and kill us because  
they are able to — and we are  
the ones who must stop that.  

These murders are not ex-  
ceptional cases of violence  
against women; that is, they are,  
not abnormal expressions of  
woman-hating, merely more ex-  
treme than usual. For women to  
be abused and killed is standard  
treatment: as Adrienne Rich  
says, ‘we were not meant to  
survive.” That we live in fear,  
that we don’t feel or use our  
strength, that we don’t believe in  
ourselves, and hate ourselves and  
appease The Man with our smiles  
and bodies, is the nature of the  
patriarchy. But by whatever  
means are available, now is the  
time to affirm that we are going  
to be survivors.  

Donations to combat this  
wave of violence against women  
are needed badly. Please send  
money to the Combahee River

(Editors’ Note: A public  
street trial, “Women vs. Gover-  
nor Edward J. King [and  
Accomplices] on the Charge of  
Rape,” will be held in Boston at  
the end of July. This action is in  
response to the murders of the  
13 women described in the  
foregoing article. For the date  
and other information, contact  
Rape Action Project, Box 94,

phone, 782-7685.  

Another protest against the  
murders will be a “Take Back  
the Night” March to be held  
Saturday, Aug. 18, in Boston.)  

ROMANTIC ROSES  

Searching...  

so desperately  
hoping to fill  
hoping to grow  

You search for love  
as if it were something  
to be found  

No  
it’s something that grows  
within yourself and another  

You may find love with  

all its red romantic roses  

but romantically in love  

and loving someone  

are two  

completely different feelings  

Sitting  

so beautiful  

like you sat  

a million times before  

I try so desperately  
in vain to stop  

my urges to hold you  
kiss you  

Your eyes look to mine  
I can see the roses  
I laugh  
I feel the rose  
in my eyes too

from houses, factories, offices, schools —  
anger-frowned faces, rage-yelling voices,  
fish-shaking, taking up “obscenities”  
which kept us from killing you  

lucky devils men.  

Thank your god we only curse you.  

We don’t hate you just for being men.  
We hate not only what you’ve DONE  
but what you've allowed to be done  

to us, seldom trying to work for the  
right you know within you  

MUST come! We hate that you deplore us.  
You have a helluva nerve!  

We wake because YOU slept.

And run

For the rest

Games to be played  
Or lessons to be learned

On Catching a Glimpse of an old man watching me  

I watched you watching me, your head  
slipped between slightly parted heavy green curtains  
in your smoke crusted window  

How long has that been your address I wonder.  
You could have been a statue  
Except you moved quickly to hide yourself  
When I slowed to watch  
you watching  
Old, alone, in a box above a gas station.  

I'm in the next box over now.  
Yours probably looks like this one — only  
your chair must be near the window.  
Walls cracked, television broken but bolted in  
just the same  
Cereal box prints on the wall. A bible by the bed.  
A bed for the night for me — Charity  
It’s home for you — imprisonment.  

Had you been a woman I would've called you sister  
and thought of my grandmother.  
I would have knocked on your door instead  
of being so quiet opening mine.  
My fear and my anger of/at your sex  
doesn’t allow me to trust you, or even care  
enough to share this run down spot.  
‘I feel cruel writing that  
clear knowing it — I have some fear of you yet.
