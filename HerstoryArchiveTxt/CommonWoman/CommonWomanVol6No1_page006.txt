Gov’s Commission
Sued

In February of 1980, Deane
Brittingham was hired by the
Governor’s Commission on the
Status of Women, as a consul-
tant to the Project Against
Domestic Violence. For the past
six months, however, Deane has
been embroiled in a lawsuit and
controversy with the Commis-
sion over her sexual preference.

A conversation was held
with Deane, and Paij Bailey and
Linda Wittenberg of Common-
woman, in order to bring a clear
picture of the events leading to
the suit.

CW: Give us some back-
ground on the Project and your
involvement with it.

Deane: The Project origin-
ally came about when Rudolph
Morse, then Chairman of the
Parole Board, made a statement
during a Committee Hearing in
the Legislature to the effect that
“battering is seen as recreation.”
A coalition of women’s organi-
zations — outraged — called for
his firing, and began to organize
a protest. Madeline Kunin called
me that weekend and asked that
we call off the demonstration
and pushed that we accept
Morse’s apology. She added that
she had talked with a woman in
the workshop under an assumed
psychiatrist who said that bat-
tered women are masochists. I
sent her and Bill Gilbert (the
Governor’s lawyer) a lot of
information on battering; she
never responded, however, Bill
Gilbert did. This coalition felt it
was a crucial time to demon-
strate; people needed to under-
stand the position that battered
women are in. When men in
Rudolph Morse’s position make
derogatory remarks, other men
see it as license to go home and
beat their wives.

While the organizations con-
tinued to organize the protest,
Madeline Kunin and the Com-
mission publicly accepted
Morse’s apology. All this
resulted in a meeting with the
Commission on the Status of
Women, Bill Gilbert, Rudolph
Morse and Mrs. Morse. That
meeting initiated communica-
tion between this coalition and
Anne Sarcka, Director of the
Commission. We began talking
about how the Commission
could better respond to grass-
roots efforts and get involved.
We wrote proposals and the
Project Against Domestic Vio-
lence was born.

CW: And what was your
position with the Project?

Deane: I applied for the
position of Consultant to the
Project. As early as my hiring
interview there were undertones
of homophobia...

CW: What do you mean?

Deane: Well, during my
hiring interview with the Com-
mission, Anne Sarcka passed a
note to a member which said,
“do you think sexual preference
will be an issue?” At any rate
they told me I was accepted for
the job, but that I (1) could not do
direct services — that I was an
administrator; and (2) that I could
not go around with “that Goddard
look.”

CW: And what is
“Goddard” look?

Deane: They were not clear.
I wear loose pants and loose
shirts...

Well I began my job, work-
ing vigorously with the Coalition
Against Domestic Violence, and we developed a plan
of what needed to be done.
However, not long after my
being hired, Anne Sarcka and
Gloria Gil met with me to
specifically discuss my les-
bianism. They appeared open
and supportive at that time.

During the year, however, a
group asked me to a workshop
on “Counseling Lesbians.” I
told them I would like to, but
that I needed to talk with Anne
Sarcka. Anne freaked out,
because of my connection with
the Commission. She said she
would have to discuss the matter
with Gloria Gil, then Chair-
person of the Commission.
Meanwhile, I decided to speak at
the workshop under my name — for purposes of the
brochure. I also followed up
with Anne Sarcka on the sub-
ject: she asked, “Can’t you put
your sexuality aside for one
year? The Commission is not
ready for this.” I told her I felt
it was imperative, and an oppor-
tunity to draw the connections
between all oppressions. Anne
said that Gloria said “no” —
something which Gloria vehe-
mently denies saying.

During the workshop I
introduced myself and shared
with attendees the fact that the
Commission was opposed to my
participating in the workshop.

CW: This is very interest-
ing... what else is there that you
would not be “allowed” to do...
such a bizarre idea that they can
regulate your extra-curricular
activities in that way...

Deane: One of the Com-
missioners attended about five
minutes of one of my Battered
Women’s Workshops. She told
Anne Sarcka she had heard from
one of the attendees that my
work was “too biased towards
women.” I was surprised that
she would even report such
information to me in the manner
that she did...

CW: What do you mean?

Deane: In criticism. She
suggested that I not be so clear
about who was doing the batter-
ing, that I not be so threatening
to men. I work real hard at being
clear. We all have to work hard
at being clear that battering is
not okay. In order to effect
change we have to be clear and
present a clear picture so that
people will know. People need
to know before they can under-
stand and effect change. Not
being clear is another way of sil-
encing us and making it accept-
able to men. To compromise our
cause by diluting it defeats our
purpose.

CW: How long was the
Project funding to last?

Deane: A year. The Coali-
tion began to lobby for funding
for the following year from the
Governor's General Fund. At the
same time, the Marriage License
Bill was on the floor.

CW: This is the bill where
the fee for marriage licenses
would be increased so that a
portion would go towards
domestic violence?

Deane: Yes. Anne Sarcka’s
strategy was that we lobby for
one or the other, not both. The
Coalition and I felt differently,
that we should lobby for both —
neither of which was really
enough for the needs.

CW: And you were inter-
ested in holding your position
the following year?

Deane: Yes. As a matter of
fact, I met with the Executive
Committee of the Commission.
They implied that I would
continue in the job and said it
would be a self-employed con-
sultant position, and that the job
would be handled as non-
classified: this made sense
because the job was only for one
year and did not have State
benefits attached to it.

Late in May, however, I was
told it was now a classified
position, and controversy in-
creased, and I left the Commis-
sion, where I had continued
to work unpaid, again, given the
heavy “implication” I was to
continue with the new funding
starting in July. In a phone
conversation with Anne Sarcka
she agreed to submit my resume
since it was now open hiring. At
the same time the Coalition
submitted my application to
continue. The Coalition later got
a message that the position was
not classified as they had told
me, so the Commission did not
have to go to open hiring. The
Department of Personnel has
confirmed that the position now
held is consultant, as I had been.
It is obvious this was an attempt
to open up the process and get
rid of me because of my lesbian-
ism, my politics. I don’t under-
stand how Anne Sarcka and the
Commission felt they could
make all these contradictions
and get away with it.

CW: What are you seeking
from this suit? Do you want
your job back?

Deane: No. It's principle
I'm after. I am asking for a jury
trial, and am suing for $50,000.
It’s an issue of speaking out
against oppression. I was talking
to my workshops about battered
women not taking abuse and
standing up to people (men) that
are oppressing them, and I was
not going to sit back and have
the Commission oppress me.
We're also talking about violence
against lesbian women. Also,
because the Commission's
actions silenced the public voices
for battered women and they
jeopardized a lot of efforts and a
lot of lives by silencing us.
We want to increase people’s
awareness about the oppression
of lesbians and the fact that
there is no sexual preference
statute, and the fact that homo-
phobia gives the license to do
this. There are some legal counts
we're suing them on...

CW: What are they?

Deane: Fraud, and misre-
presentation. They misrepresen-
ted the hiring process in order to
open the job up and get rid of
me, my lesbianism and out-
spokenness being the motivating
factors.

CW: Who is your lawyer?
How’d you acquire him?

Deane: Bill Dorsch, from
Brattleboro. He was recom-
mended by Denise Johnson,
head of the Civil Rights Division
in Montpelier. She told me
she could not get the Civil
Rights Division to defend me
because there is no sexual
preference statute. Bill Dorsch
received several calls from peo-
ple encouraging him to defend
me. He took my case at no
charge, except for expenses. Any
money that is contributed to my
defense, he will just take ex-
penses and the remainder will go
to the Coalition Against Domes-
tic Violence.

CW: I read something in the
paper recently... an ad or some-
thing about policies at some
college. Nowhere did it mention
“sexual preference” in its non-
discrimination clause... It’s
amazing how you were able to
work at that job and not “lose
it.”

Deane: When I first got the
job, I felt, "This is great... to
work with the Commission On
the Status of Women on the
Battered Women Issue. This is
the most relevant job I’ve had in
my entire life.” But, I've never
had so much harassment on a
job before.

The Commission's focus is
always on the Legislature and
long-term effects. Anne Sarcka’s
goal is for SRS to take over the
services of battered women. She
does not understand that the
system does not work for
battered women, that battered
women don't trust it... she does
not understand this. She says “in
five years there will be battered
women shelters in the State of
Vermont.” But in five years
1,000’s of women will be
battered, some to death. What
about the immediate dangerous
situation that battered women
are in?

CW: What is the Commis-
sion’s present focus on the
battered women issue?

Deane: They don’t appear
to be focused.

CW: With Snelling not
running again and the possibility
of Kunin and Jeffords running,
the position of the Commission
will be different...

Deane: They made it very
clear that the Battered Women
Project — the ‘Family Violence
Project” as they call it — will not
be funded again. Mariann Miller
is being paid to do what? All I
hear and others hear, is quiet.
She was hired a month and a
