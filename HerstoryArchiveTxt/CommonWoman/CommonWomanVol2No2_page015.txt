“In 1969 Redstockings stated in  
its Principles, ‘We do not ask  
what is radical, “revolutionary,”  
“reformist,” or ‘moral’ — we  
ask: is it good for women or bad  
for women...?’ What we've tried  
to do with this book is re-estab-  
lish some old principles and  
break some new ground,” —

International  
What?  

By Robin Taylor  

One hundred twenty years  
ago on March 8, 1857, women  
garment and textile workers on  
New York's Lower East Side  
marched to protest their work-  
ing conditions. In 1908, 51 years  
later, on the same day, women  
were marching again, still pro-  
testing the sweat shops, child  
labor, and inhumane working  
conditions — working conditions  
which had remained unchanged  
for women workers in the  
garment trades.  

The idea of a Women’s Day  
celebration was first proposed  
by Clara (Klara) Zetkin, a  
German communist and femin-  
ist. She proposed at the Interna-  
tional Socialist Conference that  
March 8 be declared Interna-  
tional Working Women’s Day  
and that it be celebrated yearly.  
Such a celebration has taken  

countries, although the United  
Nations has recently used the  
day for speeches focusing atten-  
tion on employment practices.  
In some larger cities there have  
been street demonstrations and  
other activities to focus public  
attention on the problems of  
women.  

What are women’s groups in  
Central Vermont doing to cele-  
brate International Women’s  
Day? When I asked Anne Sarcka,  
executive director of the  
Governor's Commission on the  
Status of Women, if the commis-  
sion had any plans to celebrate  
I.W.D., she said that they did  
not. She did say, ‘The commis-  
sion is focusing on employment,  
education, legislation and the  
changing role of women in the  
family. We have a number of  
task forces working in these  
areas. March 8 is the date of our  

beyond the day there is much  
going on in Vermont that  
indicates that the recognition is  
growing daily on the part of  
women and men of the need for  
advocacy for women and the  
need for the establishment of  
equal opportunity for women.  
There is a lot of new conscious-  
ness on the part of people of all  
ages which is very promising.  

Deane Brittingham, co-or-  
dinator of the Central Vermont  
Women’s Center, in response to  
a similar question regarding the  
center's plans to acknowledge  
I.W.D., stated, “We don’t have  

“Referrals  

“Sterilization information for both  
males and females  

"Vasectomy procedures  

“Birth control method of choice

ity to pay.

anything planned for that parti-  
cular day, but we have plenty of  
things going on. We have on-  
going activities that celebrate  
women every day. We are having  
a dance March 17 to celebrate  
women. The center is also  
working on a shelter house.  
We have a counseling collective.  
We've recently established a play  
group for parents and children.  
A support group of and for  
battered women is developing.  
The center is doing daily work  
focusing on women’s needs and  
issues.”  

Valerie Eckart, president of  

the Central Vermont Chapter of  
the National Organization for  
Women, said that the chapter  
had no plans to celebrate Inter-  
national Women’s Day. “A lot of  
the forces of Central Vermont  
NOW are being directed to other  
important activities in the  
women’s community. We have  
discussed doing something for  
International Abortion Rights  
Day on March 31. We have  
focused on abortion rights.”  

International Women’s Day  
won't be celebrated in Central  
Vermont this year. But, perhaps,  
this time next year...  

hold mainly in the Soviet next commission meeting. Be-
