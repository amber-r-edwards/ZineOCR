COMMONWOMAN/DECEMBER, 1981

Kemp

Continued from Page 4

Ball in the air!! Joining four
members of the “press,” the two
of us managed to monopolize a
majority of the time, asking
pointed and embarrassing ques-
tions of Kemp, who was accom-
panied by Congressman Jim
Jeffords. The cheers of the
demonstrators could be heard
loudly through the windows,
making Kemp barely audible. He
had the doors closed to drown
out “the noise.”

Vermont's industrious press
asked Kemp polite questions,
never questioning his long, pat
answers. Kemp managed to say
little of substance in his long
winded responses. I asked Jeff-
ords if his presence meant he
was back in the good graces of
the Reagan White House since his
initial vote against Reagan’s tax
bill. He refused to answer. Asked
by my co-journalist friend how
we were going to survive the cuts
and military build-up, Kemp
stated the support and will of
the “American people” in these
actions. Giving the usual reply,
he said Americans have always
been willing to sacrifice now
for the future. He also noted that
nothing could be done for poor
people with the country being
poor. Asked what he thought of
the “American people” demon-
strating outside, Kemp said he'd
been booed by 60,000 people in
stadiums so it meant nothing.
Reminded by my co-journalist
friend that this wasn't a football
game, he stood pointing at me

and yelling, “I’m talking to her, she
can answer the questions and you
ask them!” Kemp appeared to be
taken aback by our presence and
questions, and the conference
was abruptly ended. He
approached us to shake hands
for the camera, which we both
refused. He left following the
bouncing ball. The conference
had little substance, with more
interest generated by our pre-
sence than by Kemp and what he
didn’t have to say. We left with
the press and returned to our
group.

We stayed at the campus,
singing, chanting — our voices
growing hoarse from the day.
Our fervor made up for our
numbers at the moment.

Later we shared our regret,
disappointment, and anger that
more people had not come to
join in protesting the biggest
military build-up in history and
the dismantling of 50 years of
social programs. We need num-
bers if we are going to change
the course that Reagan, Kemp,
Stockman, Haig, Allen, Bush

et al has in mind for us. The
immediate future promises that
things are to get much worse,
and we are all being affected. It
is time that we support women
organized events and validate
our actions against this oppres-
sion. Our lives and the future of
this planet are at stake!

P.S. David Stockman, bud-
get director for Reagan, this
week admitted “Kemp-Roth was
always a Trojan Horse to bring
down the top,” that supply
side economists had “sold a bill
of goods,” that “none of us
really is interested in what's
going on with all these num-
bers,” and supply side econo-
mics was no more than “GOP
trickle-down economics” bene-
fitting the rich.

Pam: I think it’s short-term
and long-term strategy. In the
long range is a whole agenda for
how we're trying to make the
world a different place. If it’s a
non-sexist world we're not going
to have women selling their
bodies; sexual favors wouldn't
be your biggest commodity as a
female. But this incident just
happened in our town. Four
women, it could be any of us,
just had their lives ruined, the
incredible humiliation and pub-
lic ridicule — I just felt it
demanded some support from
us... in the short term.

Peg: It’s infuriating to me to
read the Vanguard's editorial. It
sounds fine, O.K. we don’t print
anybody's name, a civil liberties
issue. But I no sooner read that
than I get in the car and hear the
names of the women, the towns
they came from, everything
about them. It's bullshit. The
fact is, there were the women’s
names again and again. No
chance they go unrecognized.

Pam: The Vanguard was so
smug; it’s easy to be a Monday-
morning quarterback, as they
say, and just be so intellectual
about it when the rest of us are
out there taking risks, trying to
speak out and trying to be
supportive of the women. Then
you get this real chic left line
that says well they should’ve
done it this way...

Lynn: Yeah, but where
were they doing it?

Pam: Where were they when
we were just trying to react?
Sure if we’d laid out the scenario
the women’s names would've
never been released; it wouldn't
have even happened the way it
did.

Pam: It's so dangerous 'cause
it's so well written. That kind of
thing where your own peer
group can put you down. All
those philosophies — the liberal,
the left, the ACLU types, the
lawyer types...

Peg: But they’re all men — I
don’t expect anything different
than for them to all be together,
particularly when it comes to
something like prostitution.

Pam: And the Vanguard
says this is a “victimless crime.”
Well that’s bull. It’s just one of
those trendy ways of thinking.
The next thing they'll say is
kiddie porn is a victimless crime.

Peg: Well, the Vanguard's
never been noted for its insight-
fulness around sexism.

Lynn: The Vanguard wasn't
even attacking what happened —
they put more energy into
shooting down our reactions to
what happened.

we've bought the male death
culture. Trying to change things
in the culture I felt like I was
banging my head against the
wall. We can’t make it with a
revolution in the streets. We're
never going to do it in their
structure. We have to create new
structures, new forms.

P.L.: Were you a feminist
before you came out?
J.S.: I wasn't a feminist, but
I always believed in my own
rights. I didn’t really question
anything though, until Katy, my
daughter, was born. Then I
wanted to find out who I was.
What was missing was my
woman self and as soon as I
realized that, well everything
changed. Prior to coming out, I
had this series of psychic mes-
sages about women and they
were very powerful.

P.L.: I think there’s been a
lot of resistance to your work on
the grounds that it’s too idealis-
tic, unreal. Do you have any-
thing to say about that?

J.S.: I want positive images
of women loving women out
there and in that way it’s idealis-
tic, but in that way we'll be
moving toward more positive
things. I think people reject it
because women have never given
themselves validation for any-
thing. We’ve been down so long
we don’t know what it’s like to
feel good. Most women don’t
believe they deserve that. I
believe we have a right to look at
and be with beauty. That we
have a lot of power but we don’t
know we can live with that in
ourselves and in each other. I
believe in my poetry. I believe
we're that strong and then when
I take a look at that writing I
think I'm that strong, I want to
be those words and images. I
think until we get that positive
and that strong and that out
there, we're not going to see any
changes.

P.L.: I feel your show was
important in that it showed you
coming from this place that

many women can relate to. I
think it showed younger lesbians
a different coming out process
and images from a time that is
really the past to them. I think it
was good for straight women to
see where you came from; that it
was from a place (marriage,
family, kids) familiar to all
women. Sometimes I think peo-
ple think radical dykes sprang
from the air fully formed that
way so I think it was important
that the whole process was
shown.

J.S.: I feel the whole show
was subversive. Women were
exposed to it and had to be open
to it in some way. Women from
my past life. I know women
were turned on by it. I want
women to know there can be an
alternative. That we can change
every role the culture has
assigned us. I want to be totally
out and I believe there's a way
for all of us to do that. A
woman came to me during the
show and said, “All right Indigo,
where's the cat shit and the kids'
dirty thumb prints,” all the
gritty stuff she felt I left out. We
had a conversation about all that
and now she is going to do her
own show and she read at the
poetry reading and that’s her art.

P.L.: Yeah that’s what I
think when I hear this doesn’t
represent my life from someone.
I want to say well of course it
doesn’t, why don’t you do your
show? I hope that the movement
has grown up enough that we
don’t feel we have to have the
same line or style. We've had
reason to want solidarity, but I
hope now we are secure enough
with ourselves that we don’t
need conformity for validation. I think a lot of women should do
their show. That’s what Gal said
at the end of her performance.
“It's great fun and you can do it
too.”

J.S.: Yes, the space is there
and we should use it. It’s a great
way to get together. It’s been an
absolute turn on for me to put
my stuff out. I didn’t feel like it
was a big ego investment. I just
wanted to put forth my best
creative effort. I encourage
everyone to do it. It’s a time for
women, if I can come out from
such a straight place I think it’s
encouraging for others. I think
I’m a very subversive person.

She stopped here and
pointed out the window. “See
that car” (a silver Porsche sports
car). “I used to have a car like
that; now look at my car,” she
laughs. It’s a beat-up VW with a
different colored hood and it’s
packed to the brim with all that
was her show. “It’s great,” she
says, “my whole show is in
there. I feel like I could take it
with me anywhere.”
