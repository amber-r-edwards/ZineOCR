be responsible for all her pain,
the pain of shuttling between
the traditional Chinese world
and the white American one,
neither of which allowed her to
feel worthy.

“Do you know what the
Teacher Ghosts say about me?
They tell me I’m smart and I can
win scholarships. I can get into
colleges. I’ve already applied.
I’m smart. I can do all kinds of
things... I can make a living and
take care of myself. So you
don't have to find me a keeper
who's too dumb to know I’m a
bad bargain.” It's a twisting,
gut-aching reality. You fit in or
else... You become a stutterer, a

triumph for all Asian Americans.
Was it tokenism? No, the book is
too real, too heart-wrenching to
be a mere token. She wrote
beautifully, wonderfully, took
control of the English language
and used it for Asian America.
This isn't a success story, but
a painful coming into being of a
woman, an Asian American
woman who took the worst of
both worlds and emerged a
human being who could still love
and laugh and sing. Who could
hope that “Barbarian Reed
Pipes” can translate well into
Chinese. And that’s a huge hope,
because if East can meet West
and not destroy each other,
there is hope for peace and
justice in the world.
