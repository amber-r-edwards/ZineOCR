... they said they were
upset by a warning to stay
home at night”,

On the evening of October
twenty-eighth, about twenty-five
women with a few children and
men confronted Sergeant John
Sonnick for his remarks on
television that a woman should
be accompanied by a man at
night in order not to be raped.

This same scene happened five
years ago — some different
characters, same issue.

A local television station
recorded the proceedings as
several women demanded that
Sergeant Sonnick apologize for
telling women to stay in or turn
to men for protection when it is
men who rape. Women also
demanded that the police hold
training sessions to learn about
rape and battering of women
and to provide free self-defense
classes for women and children.
Here is the leaflet distributed
that night.

AMERICA

By Gwen Shervington

A couple of years ago
during the “change your name”
phase, I thought about changing
my name. I thought about
changing my name to America.
Yeah that’s right, America,
America Shervington. And
what's wrong with that? After
hearing names like Polyester or
Borateen or Vertigo, America
sounded pretty good to me! I
felt that changing my name to
America would be the ultimate
political expression; my name
would be a political statement in
itself. “Hello, I am America!”
brown skin, brown hair, brown
eyed, lesbian being introduced as
‘America.’ I was so pleased; both
elated and proud of my choice.
This would be the turning point
in my life. The recognition I’d
get would be overwhelming. Not
just from the women’s com-
munity, but from the world!

“The naming process is a
very different phenomenon from
that of the past. Formerly, your
parents gave you a name and
you used that name, for better

or worse. We all remember
Johnny Cash’s song about a
boy’s trials and tribulations
growing up named Sue. Yet Sue
never considered changing his

5 YEARS LATER~

Why We
Are Here

In the last two weeks, at
least four women have reported
being attacked. Two of the
women, who were attacked on
the street, FOUGHT BACK
and ESCAPED serious injury.
One woman was raped INSIDE
her Pearl St. apartment. The
fourth woman, 7 months preg-
nant, was assaulted INSIDE
Waterman Building at UVM.

The police have taken a man
into custody; he is in jail under
$40,000 bail. But once again,
the police (Sgt. John Sonnick on
WCAX-TV, Oct. 26) say that the
best way for women to avoid
being raped is ‘Never be alone,
never go anywhere alone.” Once
again, police imply that any
woman alone is asking to be
attacked.

WE KNOW BETTER!

We will not be prisoners in
our homes, for we are attacked
there by strangers and acquain-
tances (at least 2/3 of all rapes
are committed by men we
know). We will not let ourselves
be considered fair game because
we are alone. Are solitary men
“asking for” assault by being
alone? We women will not
curtail our lives when WE ARE
NOT THE PROBLEM: MEN are.

SCREAM, FIGHT, RUN!

Don't give up your right to
be alone, but be ready to defend
yourself. Two of the women
screamed and fought; one blew a
whistle: THEY BOTH
ESCAPED!

name. Things are much different
today. People are very self-con-
scious about their names and
don't hesitate to take on a new
one if the present one does not
meet their expectations and
visions of self. People take on
names today to describe their
inner spirits. A name is not just a
name anymore, it’s an insight
into who that person is.

Today on the Donahue
Show we have a very remarkable
woman, a woman who dared to
do what no other American
would think of doing. Please
welcome the very brave, Amer-
ica Shervington.”

Ahh, what fantasies I had
about changing my name to
America. I couldn’t wait to share
it with my friends. I knew they'd be im-
pressed and support me all the
way. During the next family
gathering, after everyone was
nice and high, I made the
announcement:

“Hey y’all, guess what?”

“What?”

“I'm gonna change my
name,”

“Oh yeah? To what?”

"To America... America
Shervington!”

We
Want:

Free Self Defense Classes
for Women; City funding of the
Women’s Rape Crisis Center;
Involvement of women’s groups
in education of police officers.

WE WANT AN END TO
SEXIST TERRORISM!

WE WANT OUR LIVES!

The moment of truth had
finally come. My friends’ appro-
val was the last bit of confidence
I needed before signing the legal
documents. They all looked at
me, then at each other, and then
they exploded into the most
thunderous fit of laughter I'd
ever seen.

“Ha, Ha, Ha, Ha! Say what?
You gonna change your name to
America?”

“Ha, Ha, Ha! Shit! Give me
some of what you been smok-
ing!”

“Ha, Ha! America? Guess
you gonna name your kids
Puerto Rico, Haiti, and Cuba,
right?”

“Ha, I ain’t going nowhere
with you with a name like that!”

Needless to say, my plans/
dreams/hopes of changing my
name to America quickly faded
into obscurity. Thanks to a little
help from my friends. And you
know, I’m not so sad I changed
my mind. At that point in time
I was sort of optimistic about
America. Thought things might
pick up, gradually get better.
But things have gone from bad
to worse. Tis a sad place we live
in! I'd be ashamed to call myself

Same Story

Now this is way beyond
shrill and

hysterical we

America because America is
beautiful no more! America is
the only place in the world
where a third rate, war happy,
bonzo actor could be president.
Where judges refuse abortions to
sexually assaulted little girls.
Where the elderly, differently
abled and low income citizens
are virtually put out to pasture.
Where it’s not safe to buy
anything from the neighborhood
store.

Thank the Goddess I didn't
change my name to America!
Can you imagine? My people
would have disowned me. If I ever traveled abroad with
America as my name, I'd be lynched in
the streets. Of course the Moral
Majority would have placed me
on a pedestal, but who heeds
that kind of support? So much
for the birth of America Sher-
vington!

When I was a kid, one of the
favorite insults to bestow on
someone was “Your Momma
Wears Combat Boots!" Well,
from here on out, if someone
tells me my mother wears
combat boots, I’m going to
retaliate with, “Oh Yeah? And
your momma’s name is Amer-
ica!”
