We got lots of positive responses
to Sondra's last article — so we're

= happy to print her second install-

ment.

When I first arrived in
Burlington I was charmed by the
Fletcher Library. I’ve always
been a sucker for large windows
and comfortable chairs, and
finding Jane Alpert’s Growing
Up Underground and Marge
Piercy’s Braided Lives on the
“New” shelf in June of 1982
was exciting. But difficulty in
proving I lived in Burlington in
order to get a borrower’s card
dampened some of that enthu-
siasm. I had to show some mail
that had been delivered to my
address; since I had a post office
box, that was a bit difficult.
Library personnel suggested that
I might have something deliver-
ed, but I was having trouble
buying groceries. I pondered
calling out for a pizza or writing
a letter to myself. I forget how
this was resolved, but I did
finally meet the library's require-
ment; the rule was not bent.
Active use of the library since
then, however, has proved that
stiff adherence to the rules is not
always the case. I’ve found the
staff and rules flexible at Flet-
cher and the library pleasant to
use.

The library sponsors a num-
ber of events such as book
discussions and the showing of
story films, and has a large
pleasant children’s room. Inter-
library loan services are avail-
able, sometimes for a small fee.

The women’s selection is
good although at times spotty.
For example, Rita Mae Brown’s
books are on the shelf, but not
her latest novel, Sudden Death.
And when looking for a copy
of Elise Boulding’s The Under-
side of History, I was surprised
not to find it. Although a serious
work, it is now a feminist classic
and probably of interest to
enough women to warrant space.

I would like to see the
library do away with late fines.
For one thing the staff is not
always consistent in collecting
them. But when they do, a fine
can hit hard on a book hog like
myself who has several new
books overdue at ten cents a
day. There has to be a more
positive method of book “con-
trol.”

The Bailey/Howe Library at
the University of Vermont has
some strong points for women in
the community. A card can be
had for the asking for Burlington
residents. The school has a good
selection of women’s books and
not just academic. The interna-
tional women’s section itself
is worth a trip up the hill.

Anyone who uses the lib-
rary often, however, will pro-
bably run into a problem with a
myriad of not-always-too-logical
rules at the circulation desk.
Indeed, sometimes it seems they
make them up as they go along.
For example, students and non-
students can have books for a
four-week period. But in the
summer, or during the
borrowing period, it is only two
weeks. And Burlington residents
who are registered at another
college or university are denied
borrowing privileges. “Our
books are for our students” and
other students can just forget it.
(My advice is not to mention it.)
On the good side, there are
no overdue fines, within reason,
that is. But don’t lose your card;
there’s a $5 replacement fee. I’d
like to see this waived for
low-income borrowers.
Books available at Fletcher:
—Alice Walker, The Color
Purple, (Harper, 1983) 2 copies.
—Alice Walker, In Search of
Our Mother’s Gardens: Feminist
Prose. (Harcourt, Brace & Jovanovich, 1983). A book of
Walker‘s essays which includes
an essay on the writing of The
Color Purple.

—Iris Murdoch, The Philo-
sopher’s Pupil. (Viking, 1983).

—Christa Wolf, No Place on
Earth. Well-known East German
feminist — her fourth book, the
third in English translation (Far-
rar, Strauss and Giroux, 1982).

—Hayden Herrera, Frida: A
Biography of Frida Kahlo. (Har-
per & Row, 1983). A biography
of a spectacular Mexican artist.
Frida specializes in self-portraits
and until recently was probably
better known for her marriage to
Mexican muralist Diego.

—Ellen Frankfort, Kathy
Boudin and the Dance of Death.
(Stein & Day, 1983). An
account of Boudin’s life under-
ground until her capture in
Nyack in 1981 in a shootout
with police. Frankfort criticizes
the violence of the left in the
sixties, but that’s a safe position
in the eighties. I think this book
suffers from having been written
in a hurry.

—Carola Hansson & Karin
Linden, Moscow Women: Thir-
teen Interviews. (Pantheon,
1983). English translation of
work published in Sweden in
1980. The roles of Soviet
women are described by women
themselves.

—Victoria Glendinning,
Vita: the Life of Vita Sackville-
West. (Knopf, 1983). Glendin-
ning is the author of Elizabeth
Bowen: A Biography published
in 1979.

—Frances Spalding, Vanessa
Bell, (Ticknor & Fields, 1983).
A biography of the painter and
sister of Virginia Woolf.

—H.D., The Gift. (Norton,
1982).

—Robin Morgan, The Ana-
tomy of Freedom, (Doubleday,
1983). An exciting attempt to
link feminist theory to contem-
porary scientific theory, Morgan
maintains the personal perspec-
tive so important in her poetry.

—Barbara Ehrenreich, The
Hearts of Men: American
Dreams and the Flight from
Commitment. (Anchor/Doubleday, 1983).

—Gloria Steinem, Out-
rageous Acts and Everyday
Rebellions. (1983).
At Bailey/Howe:

—Rita Mae Brown, Sudden
Death. (Bantam, 1983). Brown's
most recent novel of a tennis
star's lesbian relationship.

—Diana E. H. Russell, Rape
in Marriage. (Macmillan, 1983).
Russell, one of the organizers of
the 1976 Brussels Tribunal on
Crimes Against Women, is well
qualified to begin the serious
discussion of a crime still not
taken seriously.

—Paule Marshall, Praisesong
for the Widow. (Putnam's,
1983). Marshall is the author of
Brown Girl, Brownstones.

—Betty Dodson, Liberating
Masturbation. (by the author,
1974). A well-kept secret at the
library, no doubt partly because
of a redressed cover in some-
thing less provocative than one
of Dodson’s drawings.

—Claudia Tate, ed., Black
Women Writers at Work. (Con-
tinuum, 1983). Contemporary
black women writers talk about
the process of writing.

Ms., 1/84).

—Ann Snitow, et al, ed.,
Powers of Desire: The Pollution
of Sexuality. (Monthly Review,
1983) $12.50. Unfortunately
the editors have supported the
criticism of the feminist anti-
porn movement and included
Ellen Willis’ 1979 article
denouncing that movement. I
feel these women criticize the
protest against porn without
considering the reasons behind
it. They thus judge the move-
ment shallow. I feel both sides
of this debate are asking the
same questions, but aren’t listen-
ing to each other.

Money for Research. (Feminist,
1983). $5.95.

—Marge Piercy, Parti-
Colored Blocks for a Quilt. (U.

ger of going out of print when
Persephone Press folded last
year, this work has been picked
up by Crossing Press.

—Ellen Bass & Louise
Thornton, ed., I Never Told
Anyone: Writings by Women
Survivors of Child Sexual Abuse.
(Harper & Row, 1983). $5.95.
Much of what we know of the
sexual abuse of children has
come from women who tell the
story in adulthood.

—Woman Poet: The East.
(Women in Literature, Inc.,
1983). $6. I bought a copy of
this excellent anthology at Bat-
tery Street's 30% off sale. The
sale continues to the end of
January.

and Male Violence: the Visions
and Struggles of the Battered
Women’s Movement. (South
End, 1982) $8.00.

and Family Life. (W. W. Norton
& Co., 1984). I mentioned
Hayden's The Grand Domestic
Revolution in my last column.
Ms. magazine has published an
excerpt from her forthcoming
book which continues the theme
of the reorganization of living
space as essential to women’s
liberation. See ‘Making Housing
Work for People’ in Ms., Jan.
'84.

—Mary Daly, Pure Lust:
Elemental Feminist Philosophy,
(1984). I'd like to see Burlington
women’s groups catch Daly
when she goes on tour with this
book.

—In my last column I wrote
an appeal for donations to
Women Against Violence in
Pornography and Media and
omitted their address. Write:
P.O. Box 14635, San Francisco,
CA 94114.

—The Toronto Women’s
Bookstore which has been ser-
ving the Canadian women’s
community for nine years was
shut down last July when they
were inadvertently the object of
an arsonist’s attack. The real
target of the attack was an
abortion clinic which had just
opened above the store. The
bookstore lost most of its stock
and is looking for another site.
Heavily underinsured, the store
is appealing to women for help.
Donations can be sent to the
store’s temporary address at:
296 Brunswick Ave., No. 201,
Toronto, Ontario, M5S 2M7
(From Feminist Bookstore
News, 9/83).

—In Philadelphia at Christ-
mas I picked up a copy of

Burlington poet Michiyo
Fukaya, ‘Will the Real Me
