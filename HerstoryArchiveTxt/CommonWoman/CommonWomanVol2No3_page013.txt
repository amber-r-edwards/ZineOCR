victims. And, finally, we hope
someday to be able to help
“actual” rapists reform, but that
will take more preparation than
we've had so far.
= We need two things from
the womyn who read your
paper. First, encouragement and
expertise; it seems that you
discovered the problem first and
know more about it. Second,
bring our organization to the
attention of men who may wish
to join with us (We feminist men
don’t yet have our own news-
paper.) Interested men should
call 862-1501. Thank you.

Dear Commonwoman,

I LOVE your paper and
hope you get plenty of contro-
versial articles and letters so
your name will be a household
word! No home should be
without Commonwoman.

I DID appreciate your shop-
lifting article and can almost
understand why people would
feel as they do. (However, rather
than saying, “If it feels good, do
it,” I say it would be better to
not do what you cannot feel
good about yourself for doing. I
just will not believe that a
woman can like herself only
when stealing in the way busi-
nessmen can and do.) Just
recently I paid $3.49 for a can
of pure maple syrup in a store
here in my city. In the super-
market near St. Mike’s College I
saw the exact same size can,
same brand for $2.19. This is far
from an isolated instance. That’s
thievery, plain as can be. Don’t
try to tell me those men don’t
know about it — it’s too ram-
pant for me to believe they
don’t know.

ANSWERS TO ALNA

“Have you heard about
WARP? The letters stand for
Women Against Rising Prices, a
Canadian group. They boycott
(womincott) things that have
unreasonable prices and have the
help of their local newspapers,
who print the list of things to
not buy, as well as their local
television news stations who
recite the list. Wouldn't it be
nice if we could bring prices
down here in the way they have
been successful in doing? I wrote
them for information a few
weeks ago, but as yet have not
heard from them.

Please do keep on doing just
as you are, with all sorts of mads
and glads, any mood, so long as
it's a woman’s. I read EVERY
word, including advertisements.

May I suggest (or maybe
you already have done this)
sending a complimentary copy
of your paper to every library in
the state to see if they would
order it?

Affectionately,

Dear Commonwoman,

I just came from your
benefit with Carol Cohen and
Joknee — and I feel good! It was
a good high time for us in the
women’s community who cele-
brate and depend on experienc-
ing our own culture. We need
our gatherings — and Common-
woman — to affirm our reality. I
hope it is one of many benefits
for Commonwoman. What bet-
ter kind of benefit than one
which leaves both Common-

woman and its community feel-
ing better for it? And I’m glad
that you knew that every event
needs childcare and just simply
provided it.

dear friends,

I am writing in response to
letters that have been written to
Commonwoman and the van-
guard press by a woman named
Alna Detro. I have found myself
disagreeing with Alna most of the
time. I feel much confusion
about things that she writes, feel
anger at the way she puts
things out — and out of all this, I
wonder if Alna Detro is a real
person, or simply a pen name to
hide behind? I feel that Alna
Detro puts out a lot of criticism
and judgment at political acti-
vists, with little support of the
valid work and changes that are
being made.

Alna, you said you were
once a feminist. What happened?
I also am a feminist and cannot
understand how someone can
make awarenesses of women’s
oppression and treatment in this
society, especially from a wo-
man’s point of view, and then
lose that perspective — which
is how it sounds with you, Alna.
You've stated that the Communist
Party Marxist-Leninist (CPM),
which I believe is a branch of the
Communist Party, endorses the
women’s movement. I can
believe on some level that they
do — after all, there are plenty
of feminists that put energy into
this group, and they can't ignore
us any more. However, I feel that
CPM and many other groups will
not recognize that men oppress
women just as much as the
capitalist system does. Women
and children are oppressed by
men in every facet of our lives —
at home, on the streets, in our
workplaces, we are battered, we
are raped, we are stripped of our
worth daily.

Men are given a lot of power
and privilege in this society and
they need to recognize it and
change things before I can feel
their support. Alna, I feel much
confusion when you talk about
women who reject men and I
also feel your judgment and
invalidation behind whatever
you mean by that statement. Do
you mean women who recognize
that men oppress women, or do
you mean lesbians who choose
not to include their oppressors
(men) in most of their lives? In
either case, I think both are valid
choices personally and politically,
and need to be recognized
as such. Though the reality in our
society is that many people are
intimidated by women making
awarenesses and working toge-
ther, growing stronger in making
individual and collective chan-
ges.

Alna, I feel that this is just
one of many issues you've raised
in your letters that I would like
to respond to. I would like you
to make yourself known to the
lesbian-feminist wimmin’s com-
munity in Burlington, so that we
could further discuss these
issues.

In sisterhood,

Sandy Dwyer
Alna Detro,

Your letter in the last issue
of Commonwoman, much of
which was to criticize my
vibrator article, felt like a
personal attack. Commonwoman
is a newspaper which is supposed
to present a forum for differing
views. Hopefully, we will respect
each other’s attempts at expres-
sion, realize our vulnerability,
and criticize honestly and open-
ly. Your accusations seem more
like a statement of your own
fear than an accurate overview
of my writing.

Your implication that all I
have on my mind is sex, and that
that’s bad, comes across to me as
a defensive, frightened statement
about yourself. It has been a
struggle for women to uncover
and validate our sexuality, and
to understand our sexual oppres-
sion in a political context. I
believe my writing on sexual
issues is part of that struggle. I
found your attacking response
an offensive and unnecessary
way to disagree, however strong-
ly you do, with my writing.
