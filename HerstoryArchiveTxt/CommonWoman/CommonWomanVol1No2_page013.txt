intriguing? These are just a few
of the wines that you can make
at home! Winemaking is simple
and fun. The kinds of wines that
you can make are limited only
by your imagination — and they
all taste terrific! Fruit wines are
also inexpensive to make and
most of the equipment that you
need, you already have in your
kitchen.

At this point you may be
saying, “but I thought wine was
only made from grapes! And
how do I do it? And what is
wine, anyway?” Let’s take those
questions one at a time.

First, what is wine? Wine is a
complex mixture of fruit sugars,
vitamins, minerals and alcohol.
It is a very healthful beverage (in
moderation, of course) and is
rich in B vitamins, iron and
vitamin C. Wine is prepared from

Wine, Women & Song:

four main ingredients: yeast,
sugar, flavorings and water. The
yeast is the most important
ingredient; it is a microscopic
living organism which feeds on
the sugar and converts it to
carbon dioxide gas and alcohol.
There is a huge variety of yeasts,
and each kind (chablis,
burgundy, etc.) imparts its own
character to the wine.

In order for this natural
process, called fermentation, to
occur, the living conditions for
the yeast must be favorable for
growth. These conditions occur
in a sweet, slightly acid fruit
juice when the temperature is
maintained between 18 — 24
degrees Celsius (65—75 degrees
Fahrenheit). There are two
stages in fermentation: the first
one is quite vigorous and frothy,
and will last 5—6 days; the
second stage is much quieter,
and may last 2—4 months. As
the fermentation proceeds, the
alcohol content increases until it
reaches a concentration which
inhibits the yeast’s growth. At
this point the fruit juice is fully
fermented but the wine has a
“raw” taste and needs to be aged
for several months to achieve its
smooth, mellow character. It
takes about 6 months to prepare
a fruit wine from start to finish.

Now, how do you do it? You
will need a large, open container

which can hold 8—40 liters
(about 2—5 gallons) to start the
fermentation in, and a 6.5 liter
(about 1 gallon) container with a
neck to do the second
fermentation stage in. Do not
use iron, brass or copper
containers or utensils in making
wine because they impart a
metallic flavor to the wine.
Aluminum is fine, and enamel,
earthenware crockery, wood and
plastic are all excellent. You also
need a large balloon,
cheesecloth, a strainer, a funnel
and a long spoon.

The basic recipe for fruit
wines is very simple and is
illustrated here for raspberry
wine:

RASPBERRY WINE
1.75 Kilograms (3 lbs) fresh or
frozen raspberries
1.50 Kilograms (2 lbs) sugar or
honey
4.50 liters (1 gallon) water
1 package (1 tsp) baker’s or
brewer's yeast

Place the cleaned fruit in the
open container. Boil the water
and pour it over the fruit. Allow
the mixture to cool. Mash the
fruit up well, cover the container
with cheesecloth and leave the
mixture for 4 days at 18 — 24
degrees C°(65 — 75 degrees F),
stirring daily with the long
spoon. After 4 days, strain the

mixture, saving the juice. Pour
the juice back into the cleaned
open container, add the sugar or
honey and stir to dissolve. Add
the yeast and stir thoroughly.
Leave for 24 hours in the open

container covered with
cheesecloth; the mixture will
froth and bubble vigorously.

Pour into the container with a
neck and pull the mouth of the
balloon over the neck of the
container. The mixture will
continue to bubble and the
balloon will swell as the pressure
from the carbon dioxide gas
builds up. Leave the container
undisturbed for several months
and the wine will begin to clear
from the top down. When the
wine is clear, it can be poured
into a clean plastic bottle to age
for at least 3 months. Then it is
ready to drink! This recipe
makes a medium-sweet wine. If
you like a dry wine, or are a
diabetic, use 0.25 kilogram (½ lb) less sugar or honey.

What is happening in the
fermentation process is
fascinating! The yeast needs air,
sugar and water to grow and the
byproducts of its growth are
carbon dioxide gas and alcohol.
By leaving the mixture exposed
to air for 24 hours we get a
strong yeast colony. When we
put the balloon over the
container, we cut off the yeast’s

supply of air. The yeast can still
grow, but it must use the sugar
in a different way which
produces much more alcohol!
Your wine, when finished, will
contain about 12 — 14% alcohol,
as most table wines do.

The simple recipe above can
be used with many fruits, such
as cherries, cranberries,
strawberries and blackberries. To
make wine from apples, pears,
peaches, pea-pods or celery, cut
the fruit up and boil in 4.5 liters
(1 gallon) of water for 20 — 30
minutes. Cool and strain the
mixture into the open container,
and add the yeast. In addition,
since these fruits are low in
natural acids, add the juice of 2
lemons (1 Tbsp) to the mixture.
When the fermentation slows,
pour into the container with a
neck, fit the balloon in place,
and continue as described in the
recipe. Another really delicious
wine is made from bananas,
using 1.75 Kilograms of bananas
and 0.35 Kilograms (¾ lb) of
banana skins. Prepare the
bananas and skins as described
for apples, etc.

A word of caution is advisable
to those who are thinking of
unusual ingredients to make into
wine. Be sure that the leaves,
flowers, herbs, roots, etc. are not
poisonous! Some plants which
