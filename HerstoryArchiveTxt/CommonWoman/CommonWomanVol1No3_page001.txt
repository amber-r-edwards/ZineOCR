FEMINIST

FORUM

ON THE FUTURE

By Peggy Luhrs and

Mare Earley  
The Women’s Movement, feminist strategy, and the  
Forum on the Future, gathered some of the leading political  
theoreticians, activists and speakers of the feminist  
movement together for the first time in years.

The Forum was sponsored by  
the Foundation for Matriarchy  
and took place on the 16th of  
September, a Saturday  
afternoon in New York City.

Reporters for Common-  
woman were there; and what  
follows is an up-to-date report of  
what this Forum concluded as to  
where the movement stands,  
where it has been, and where,  

most importantly, we, as a  
revolutionary movement, are  
going.

The general tone of the  
conference was towards  
coalition, unity, the  

development of an aggressive  

mounting a highly organized  
campaign funded by  
corporations and the church to  
destroy the gains made by  
women, blacks and gays since  
the sixties. The fact that these  
women had a common  
knowledge of the power and  
existence of this group was a  
frightening reality. Gloria  
Steinem said, “the right wing  
knows what we're about.” Midge  
Costanza told us that the right  
wing is not playing games, and  
that they are after a  
Constitutional convention to  
wipe out every gain the women’s  
movement has made. Ti-Grace

Vermont Governor’s  

Commission on the  
Status of Women  

By Pamela J. Greene  

In 1964, President Kennedy  
initiated a National Commission  
on the Status of Women, in  
response to the Civil Rights Act  
of that same year.  
Representative Howard Smith  
(D—Va.) had inserted the word  
sex as a joke, in hopes of seeing  
the entire act defeated. It was  
with this frail start, that the  
concept of discrimination, based  
on sex, began to be examined by  
the government.

Every governor was asked by  
President Kennedy to set up a  
state commission to study the  
status of women. Governor Hoff  
responded and, in 1964, the  
Vermont Governor's  
Commission on the Status of  
Women was formed. The  
commission has since been  
reaffirmed by Governors Davis,  
Salmon and Snelling.

The first year’s total budget  
was $1,000, which was barely  
enough to cover the  
commissioners’ expenses. The  

commissioners are appointed by  
the Governor for a term of 4  
years. For the first 10 years, the  
Commission did not have an  

The jury selection under  
Judge Coffrin has begun in the  
case of the United States of  
America versus Kristina Berster.  
Judge Coffrin questioned and  
advised prospective jurors in  
groups. A motion during  
pre-trial hearings to dismiss the  
case because of prejudicial and  
damaging media exposure was  
refused and the judge examined  
the jurors concerning that  
motion.

office. In July of 1977, the  
current office was opened at 126  
State Street in Montpelier. In  
1974 funding for the  
Commission was obtained by a  
CETA grant which allowed for a  
3-year pilot project supporting 3  

full-time positions: the Executive  

Director, an employment  
coordinator, and an  
administrative assistant. During  
the 1978 Legislative session,  
after much debate, the  
commission was granted a  
budget of $54,759 to maintain  
the 3 staff positions and fund  
the office. Most other states had  
been funding their commissions  
by this method for some time.

The current statement of  
purpose is as follows:

The Governor's Commission  
on the Status of Women is  
concerned with the economic,  
legal, social and political status  
of women in Vermont, and  
serves as a catalyst to other  

agencies and institutions in  
addressing problems in these  
areas.

as to whether they had  
relationships of any kind with  
law enforcers, immigration or  
border officials; whether they  
felt that the word of a law  
officer would hold more weight  
with them in court than that of  
a defendant or other witness; if  
the fact that the defendant  
spoke with a foreign accent  
would bias them; whether or not  
they were familiar with Ms.  
Berster’s counsel, William  
Kunstler; if they had ever heard

of Kristina or her case and  
whether or not they had formed  
an opinion on the case. The  
potential jurors were also  
questioned about their place of  
birth, employment, employment  
of spouse (if any), number, age  
and sex of children (if any).

The jurors were then admitted  
singly and questioned carefully  
by the judge and counsels. The  
prosecuting attorneys initiated  
few questions at this point.
