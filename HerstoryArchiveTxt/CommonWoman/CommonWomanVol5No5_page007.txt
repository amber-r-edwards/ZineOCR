QUESTIONS ABOUT S&M

By Glo Daly

I know that S and M,  
however it may be defined, is an  
integral part of American life.  
Although it is my fantasy that it  
is more pervasive in the lives of  
heterosexuals and gay males, it  
seems that it may be touching  
the lives of lesbians more than it  
has been, and that is my concern.

We are living in some hard  
times. We all know that the  
planet is in danger of being  
destroyed by the greedy boys  
with their death-dealing toys.  
We've sailed in on the Second  
Wave of feminism only to crash  
into a most intense backlash,  
symbolized by the election of  
that monster/mutant Ronald  
Reagan. Nineteen eighty-four, as  
portrayed in Orwell’s book, is  
very close.

Our culture, too, is indica-  
tive of the times, and it happens  
concurrently and intentionally  
with political changes. It’s not  
hard to see that male-created  
fashion is trying to push us back  
into the frilly passivity of some  
yesteryear. Back to the crippling  
spiked heels... back to looking  
brainless and being helpless.

By comparison, punk styles  
are more fun and may feel like  
some form of resistance, but  
punk may carry its own insidi-  
ous message. Part of the punk  
message is to be numb, to  
worship death, to move like a  
machine, to look sick or wasted  
or dead. So punk fashion says,  
“Get with it, women of America,  

Be part of the sick, dying  
machine. Numb out. Get in  
vogue, women of America. If  

you want to be comfortable  
with these times, a part of  
what's happening, you must plug  
in with some part of yourself to  
the death culture.” If we opt for  
being alive, healthy, caring, and  
feeling, we will surely feel “out  
of it” and alien. Not only that...  
we may even feel the need for  
some sort of progressive change  
or revolution.

Not very long ago, there  
were women in Burlington and  
in other towns and cities who  
were talking about feminist  
visions. We were excited about  
books like Barbara Starrett’s  
Dream in Female, Mary Daly's  
Gyn/Ecology, The Wander-  
ground by Sally Gearheart,  
Susan Griffin‘s Woman and  

Nature, Herland by Charlotte  
Perkins Gilman, and Marge  
Piercy’s Woman on the Edge of  
Time. We were being inspired by  
these visionary works. We spoke  
about moving toward a more  
female reality. These visions are  

no longer prevalent on the  
urban feminist scene in this  
country... (although in the  

women’s movement in Europe  
and elsewhere, these visions are  
still vigorous). Why is that? What  
is happening? I think one thing  
that is happening is that many  
women are finding it too painful  
and alienating to hold onto and  
create new feminist visions that  
seem to be getting further  
and further away from the  
reality of 1981 in America. It  
seems easier to allow ourselves  
to be drawn into the “contem-  
porary” culture of punk and  
S&M. I'm speaking of punk and  
S&M in the same breath not  
because I see them as the same  
but because they both seem  
rooted in a culture that em-  
braces death. Another similarity  
is that even though S&M has  
always existed and now some  
people are merely “coming out”  
about it, which I support, there  

may also be a “trendy” move-  
ment toward it, especially in the  
large cities. It may be that by  
consciously or unconsciously  
connecting with these things we  
can feel more like we belong,  
more in synchrony with the  
times, less alienated. It’s hard to  
hold up a vision of a female  
utopia when the world leaders  
are death-mongering machos  
who make John Wayne look like  
a sweet kid. We begin to feel  
“out of it.”

I have a lot of questions  
about going along with it. It  
feels hard to change the “power-  
over” trip, but we can RESIST  
it. As this trend toward punk  
and S&M becomes more and  
more “where it’s at,” I am  
asking myself, is this what I  
need? Is this taking me where I  
want to go as a feminist/lesbian/  
anarchist with a strong desire to  
be living in a “matri-anarchal”  
way? Do I want to follow the  
death mask, to move and dance  
with the computer, the robot, to  
opt for numbness? I don’t  
advocate censorship, but I do  
encourage women to ask these  
questions.

It’s difficult to use the term  

S&M because we all have differ-  
ent understandings of what it  
is... or isn’t. It can mean any-  
thing from fantasy work to  
terminal sex during which one  
partner is inadvertently killed. I  
would like to talk about what it  
might mean and why I think  
some kinds of psycho/sexual/  
emotional interactions aren't  
what we need... assuming we are  
feminists with a vision of a  
better way to live. Again,  
censorship isn’t what I’m after. I  
would firmly defend the rights  
of consenting adults to any kind  
of sexual behavior between  
them, but I want to take a  
careful look at how we may be  
helping to program ourselves by  
our own activities.

In a recent interview with  
Pat Califia and Gayle Rubin in  
the August issue of Gay Com-  
munity News, Califia talks about  
liking to tie a woman down so  
she can have the chance to enjoy  
using all her strength and really  
feeling her muscles strain against  
the ropes. It can be enjoyable to  
use all one’s strength when being  
sexual, but why be tied by the  
ropes? Why not be free to grab

INTERVIEW

By Joyce Cheney

HILDE PLOSKER has a  
newly opened chiropractic prac-  
tice in Burlington. CW talks with  
her about her work, and about  
healing in general.

CW: What kind of training  
do you have as a chiropractor?

HP: Now, I believe you  
need a college degree. When I  
first started, all you needed was  
pre-med prerequisites to get into  
chiropractic school. I’ve had 7  
years of undergrad school  
because I started off in nursing,  
then switched to music, then art  
and theatre, and back to pre-  
med bio.

CW: Did you finish nursing  
training?

HP: No. I spent a year in  
nursing school and volunteered  
in a hospital, and realized after  
that year that I didn’t want to  
drug people. Chiropractic school  
is another four years. It has an  
equivalent of science courses as  
for a medical doctor. The only  
difference is that the doctor  
studies drugs and surgery, and a  
chiropractor specializes in differ-  
ent techniques to adjust the  

spine, and some muscle testing,  
determining muscle strength and  
relating it to different organ  
functions. A lot of what I’ve  
learned has been outside of  
school, in seminars. I’ve been  
interested in natural health care  
methods for probably ten years.

CW: How do you see  
chiropractic fitting into tradi-  
tional Western medicine?

HP: I see Western medicine  
as treating the symptoms of a  
person’s disorder. They don’t  
really get to the cause of what is  
causing that trouble, whether it  
be emotional or the diet... I deal  
with a person on a whole basis.  
No matter what a person comes  
in complaining of, I look at that,  
but I basically adjust the spine. I  
allow communication to be  
opened between the brain and  
the rest of the body, without  
having all these nerve block-  
ages. If you have blockages in  
the spine, it can manifest in a  
million different symptoms.

CW: Lots of people go to  
chiropractors for bad backs —  
the kind of pain associated with  
stress. What is the point of

getting chiropractic treatment if  
the stress is still going to go on?  
Won't you just have to keep  
coming back?

HP: If I can do anything, it  
is to make the person aware of  
what their problems are and  
what they need to do about it.  
They are going to have to work  
on certain other aspects of their  
lives. I may not be the only kind  
of doctor they need to see.

CW: So you find yourself  
doing counseling sorts of things?

HP: I find myself talking to  
people quite a bit about what is  
bothering them. I find that a lot  
of people who come in are doing  
heavy labor, and maybe the  
situation they're working  
around, maybe the people,  
aren’t good for them. I feel it is  
my duty to tell them if their job  
isn’t conducive to their health,  
though that can’t necessarily be  
changed.

CW: Do you think that  
regular doctors have anything to  
offer?
