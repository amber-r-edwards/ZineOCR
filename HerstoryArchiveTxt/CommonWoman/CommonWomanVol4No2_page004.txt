Central Vt
Women’s Center Moves

By Helen Greenspan

The Central Vermont
Women's Center is moving! As
of March 1, we will no longer be
at the Langdon Street location
in Montpelier. We will be leaving
that grand old space and moving
around the corner to 155 Elm
Street.

Since July, 1980 (when
CETA stopped paying for a staff
worker), the CVWC has been
struggling to try to stay afloat
amongst overdue bills, rent
money, etc. As well, we have
been attempting to maintain our
commitment to the community
in terms of education, resources,
counseling, and referral services.
We began volunteer staffing as a
way to keep the Women’s Center
open daily, and we set up task
forces to take responsibility for
different functions of the Cen-
ter, areas which we felt were
crucial to address.

Unfortunately, women's
time was limited, commitments
seemed hazy, and energies were
drained. Fundraising for survival
became the “issue” and I think

we became somewhat paralyzed
in this. The task forces stopped
without discussion, few activities
were planned because of the lack
of money. Many of us burned
out from being stuck at the
financial-survival-level of another
women's organization. I also
think that we had come to be
dependent on the paid staffer
(Lynda), who had worked there
for a year, and that we had given
much of the responsibility for
the Women’s Center to her.
When she left, I think we were
unprepared and unable to take
on long-term responsibility for
the Women’s Center.

I personally feel that we
stopped being accountable to
each other, to the goals of the
Center, and to the community
surrounding us. This is not to
deny or invalidate the time and
work that a few women con-
tinued to put into the Women’s
Center during this time, but for
the most part the Women’s
Center was not receiving a lot of

BLAK LESBIAN
COALITION

Statement of Purpose
By the Blak Lesbian Coalition

The BLAK* LESBIAN
COALITION is a Support Group
for Black and Third World
Women whose aim includes
reclaiming our identity (which
has heretofore been submerged
in Anglo culture) and contribu-
ting a strong Blak presence in
the State of Vermont. (*Note:
We are a group of women of
color not separated by our
differences, hence the removal
of the “c” from Black.)

We believe the Blak perspec-
tive to be an important — and
imperative — milieu that the
citizenry needs to understand
and appreciate, especially if it is
seriously concerned with affect-
ing racial harmony.

Our concerns are centered
around the common needs of all,
regardless of race, color, creed or
national origin, or sexual prefer-
ence; setting as a priority the
needs of the Blak Woman.

Goals and Objectives:

* Establishment of a
resource library and museum, so
that our herstory is preserved.

* Further projection of the
positive image of the Blak
Woman, through public presen-
tation (all people welcome) of
our literature, art, media, photo-

graphy, theater, dance, drums,
public forums, workshops and
curricular resource.

* Serving as an anti-
defamation clearinghouse, we
will identify and address inci-
dences of racism in textbooks,
advertising and other materials.

* Identifying, disseminating
information on all issues
affecting our lives, soliciting
input from the community.

* Giving input into a Blak
Glossary currently being com-
piled.

* Working in cooperation —
and coalition — with groups
dealing with important issues
involving Blaks.

It is important and neces-
sary that the Blak Lesbian
Coalition be representative of
the total Blak Women’s Com-
munity. Thus, membership
currently consists of educators,
scholars, business women, ana-
lysts/researchers, the older
woman, the feminist, and
others.

ALL members are “leaders”
and are all responsible to and for
goals, objectives and structures.

the Blak Lesbian Coalition, call

FAIR RENTS

By Chess

PACT (People Acting for
Change Together), along with
other local groups, has been
working on and studying fair
rents for the past five years.
PACT feels that stabilizing rents
in Burlington is the first step
that must be taken to alleviate
some of the burden that is
placed squarely on the backs of
tenants in this town.

The above conclusion was
also arrived at by the Mayor’s
Housing Task Force in Decem-
ber of last year. With the back-
ing of the Task Force, we at
PACT started a petition drive to
have fair rents on the March
ballot, for the voters to decide
for themselves. However, on
January 12, the Board of Alder-
people sent the proposal back to
committee on a vote of 7-5.
Mayor Gordon Paquette did not
back the Task Force as he
publicly stated he would.
Instead he was overheard saying
that “it is not the city’s place to
be responsible for tenants.”
Again we see how the govern-
ment sides when it comes to
profit vs. the benefit of the
people.

There is a severe housing
emergency existing in Burlington
with regard to rental housing,
due to the rapidly rising rents
resulting from the shortage of
rental housing accommodations.
This problem has produced and

will continue to produce a threat
to the public health, safety, and
general welfare of the citizens of
Burlington. The fear of being
evicted and forced into such a
housing market discourages Bur-
lington residents from com-
plaining about unjustified rent
levels, and this fear contributes
to these high rents.

In order to protect the
health, safety, and welfare of the
tenants of Burlington, PACT is
petitioning to amend the Bur-
lington Charter to create a
Burlington Fair Rent Commis-
sion to review and regulate rents.
How It Will Work:

On April 21 there will be a
special election so that the
mandate of the people can be
heard. PACT does not see the
Fair Rent Commission as the be
all and end all of the problems
faced by Burlington tenants.
Rather it is the first positive step
on the road to equality in
housing.

The Fair Rent Commission
will be composed of seven
members, inclusive of two ten-
ants, two landlords and three
non-tenants, non-landlords. It is
generally felt that this composi-
tion will guarantee fairness to all
parties concerned. The Board of
Alderpeople will be responsible
for the appointments and will
accept nominations for all posi-
tions.

All rent-increase complaints

Incest
Workshop

By Maxine Merrick

Incest is taboo. Just ask an
incest survivor... if you can find
one. They've had to cover up
fear, frustration, confusion,
anger and hatred because society
will not admit that incest occurs.
They have had no way to vent
their feelings.

Euan Bear, with the help of
four support women, gave an
incest workshop February 21 to
help women begin to deal with
and confront the issue. Women
who have been sexually abused
by family members are hurt,
afraid and even ashamed.

Even more terrifying than
an incestuous act itself is a
suggestion from one woman in a
film shown at the workshop that
it happens throughout genera-
tions if it is never dealt with.
The woman believes that her
mother was sexually abused by
her own father and admitted
that if she herself never con-
fronted the problem, that her
children would probably be
abused by the type of man she
would marry.

According to one woman at
the workshop, the issue three
women spoke about in the film
“crept up on you slowly then all
of a sudden gave you a jolt.”
Incest is difficult to deal with
even for someone who has never
experienced it.

When the film was over and
the lights turned on, the room
was silent. Women stared into
space trying to get in touch with
their feelings and what they had
just heard and seen. Not one out
of some 30 women spoke for
many minutes.

The next part of the work-
shop was to let incest survivors
talk about what they had gone
through themselves. Any non-
incest women were asked to
leave the room. This was under-
standable.

Rape was covered up for so
long by so many people, it’s
been only recently that women
are feeling strong enough to
report it, discuss the issue and
fight back. The incest issue is
just now being recognized and
dealt with on an open level. It
must go through the same
metamorphosis which the rape
issue has gone through.

Euan Bear‘s workshop is
just a beginning.

All rent-increase complaints
will be retroactive to January 1
of this year, so that the new plan
will cover any retaliatory rent
increase that a landlord might
charge. Any rent increase a
tenant receives either before
she/he takes possession of an
apartment or after can be
appealed to the Fair Rent
Commission within three
months after the increase was
given. The Commission will
