LETTERS

Girlecott

Dear Commonwoman:

I would like to publicize a

business transaction that happened

between The Little Professor Book-

store and Dragons, including 13,000 Ama-

zon Tarot Decks, which they sell

and profit from, without compensating me in any way.

I chose to do Healing Intensives this year as a way to help

heal myself from the wounds inflicted by Billie and River. I

wrote to them to let them know that I would be holding Inten-

sives and to offer/suggest that monies from the Intensives be

used to pay mortgage and taxes on the land. I chose to use the

flyer that I had previously designed because it was my per-

sonal graphic statement about the Intensives. That flyer was

and continues to be my individual design, carrying my name

as artist and graphic designer. I have never received payment

from SUM nor Billie nor River for their three years use of my

design and I consider it my full right to continue to use my own

artwork and design skills for whatever purposes I choose.

I have been and continue to be ready and able to buy out

Billie's and River's shares of Rowdybush at the legally

affixed equitable value. There will be Healing Intensives in

store (Church St., Burlington) and my partner and myself.

We had six of our self-published

children’s songbooks on consignment

in the store under the previous

management. When the store changed

owners we went in to discuss con-

tinuing our consignment contract

with the new management. He nastily

told us he wasn’t interested and to

take our books and leave. We took

the three books we found displayed.

Six weeks later a friend told us she

had purchased two copies of our

songbook from The Little Professor

that week. So we went in to get our

money for the two books. I told the

owner about the purchase. He looked

through the remaining copy and said,

“I’ve never seen this book. I told you

the last time to take your books and

‘get out!”

He and I went outside where he

with his six-foot-seven large frame

stood shaking his finger at me,

interrupting my attempt at what I

thought was a business conversation.

The least I expected was a

respectful business interaction.

Instead I received hostility and

intimidation. I will never do business

with The Little Professor (Church St.

store) again. I would like other

customers and writers to take note.

Etana Finkler

P.S. A friend told us that the

present “new management” told her

1983; please contact me if you are interested.

Susun S. Weed

P.O. Box 64

Woodstock, NY 12498

Dear Commonwoman:

As a member of the Catskill

lesbian community, I’d like to

share my wondering — how do

Billie and River know what issues

Susun Weed has moved on, given that

they don’t seem to be in direct

communication with her, they didn’t

attend any of the four open com-

munity discussions specifically on

racism in the past year, and they

didn’t attend the Lesbian Network

meeting on violence?

EACCC

Dear Friends of Commonwoman:

On September 10, after

eleven years of providing child-

care for the children of this

community, Ethan Allen Child

Care Center is being forced

(budget cuts, decrease in enroll-

ment, inability to find an afford-

able location) to close its doors.

For me personally this is a

time of great sadness and frus-

tration as I’ve been associated

with EACCC for the past 10½

years and did not envision its

ever having to close.

The EACCC Corporation is

hoping to remain intact. We will

have regular board meetings with

the hope of re-opening in the

spring.

In order to make this

closing as expedient as possible

we are asking our friends in the

community for their help. If you

can help with the many tasks

that need doing, please call me

at 656-2648.

Thank you.

Yours in struggle,

Joan Sweet

Director EACCC

Dear Commonwoman:

I am corresponding with a

woman in prison in Washington

State. They have had personal care

items cut and since they are in a rural

area, have little support in the

surrounding community. I would like

to ask resourceful Burlington women

to think about helping some sisters

on the West Coast. When you buy —

deodorant, cigarettes, sanitary pads,

hand lotion, matches, shampoo,

tampons, toothbrushes, toothpaste,

hairbrushes, etc. think about

buying for two. Look for the box in

Everywoman’s Place. I will pack and

ship the stuff.

XX to CW

Dear CW:

Traveling made me appreciate

the lesbian community here at home.

It’s not everything, or perfect, but a

lot is happening here.

I specifically want to say how

glad I am that CW exists — that there

is a local paper, so that a lot of us can

share our thoughts. In every issue

there is work by someone previously

unpublished. It is exciting that it is

such a homegrown paper. I got a

tremendous boost of energy from

home every time I got CW. Thanks to

all of us.

Joyce Cheney

Dear Commonwoman:

The newspaper just keeps get-

ting better and better. The last issue's

center page was an inspiration.

Since my last letter to you

(March '81) I have received all of the

back issues I missed and subsequent

issues have arrived monthly. My only

difficulty this year has been in

hanging on to them as they tend to

get passed on to friends far away. To

remedy this, I am enclosing a check

to cover 3 subscriptions. Please

continue to send to me at my new

address and to my 2 friends. Thanks

again for continued inspiration.

Continue the struggle,

Kay Griffin
