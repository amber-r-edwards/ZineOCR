Adrienne Rich at Goddard

By Carol Cohen

Warning. Do not expect this  
article to be a critical analysis of  
Adrienne Rich or her poetry. I  
went to her Halloween reading  
at Goddard College prepared to  
believe every word she said, even  
though I know there is some  
danger in this sort of passivity. I  
consider listening to Adrienne  
Rich a luxury of trust.

I remember taking a modern  
poetry course in college during  
the early ‘60s and deciding to  
write a paper on T.S. Eliot's  
“Four Quartets,” even though  
only a line here and there made  
any sense at all to me. I puzzled  

over those poems for hours  
trying to piece together their  
meaning, implications, symbo-  

lism, philosophy. A part of me  
enjoyed the challenge of wading  
through these “difficult” poems  
from the academic tradition, but  
now I realize that I expended all  
that energy on trying to receive  
a message about the uselessness,  
the emptiness of men’s lives.

Adrienne Rich also began  
publishing from within the pat-  
riarchal academic tradition, but  
from there she followed her own  
truths, respected her own voice,  
and now clearly speaks from  
within the lesbian-feminist cul-  
ture. Here is a woman willing to  
remain true to her own passion  
for words now detailing the  
horrors of misogyny throughout  
history, now defining the pains  
and joys of women loving  
women. I know that the time I  
spend puzzling over the com-  
plexities of her poetry will lead  
me to messages I need to hear.

For example, Adrienne Rich  
knows that women withdrawing  
energy from men is a matter of  
survival, yet she also recognizes  
the sadness, the danger, the pain  
involved in such a process. In her  
poem ‘From an Old House in  
America,” she says, “If they call  
me a man-hater you would have  

known it for a lie.” Yet further  
on she talks about “the irreduci-  

ble, incomplete connection/  
between the dead and the living/  
or between man and woman in  
this/ savagely fathered and un-  
mothered world.” She concludes  
that she “cannot now lie down/  
with a man who fears my power/  
or reaches for me as for death/  
or with a lover who imagines/ we  
are not in danger.” Her political  
stance is firm, yet there is a  
gentle quality to the lines: “I try  
to understand/ he said what will  
you undertake/ she said will you  
punish me for history/ he said  
what will you undertake/ she  
said.”

Again, in the poem “Paula  
Becker to Clara Westhoff” she  
addresses the problem of women  
tying up their lives with men.  
Paula, an artist who married  
another painter (Otto Moder-  
sohn) writes to her close friend  
Clara, who married the poet  
Rainer Rilke.

Rainer, of course, knows more  
than Otto knows,  

he believes in women. But he  
feeds on us,

like all of them. His whole life,  
his art  

is protected by women. Which  
of us could say that?  

Which of us, Clara, hasn’t had to  
take that leap  

out beyond our being women  

to save our work? or is it to save  
ourselves?  

Marriage is lonelier than solitude.  

This fine woman poet for  
me is a necessary link between  
patriarchy and the lesbian-  
feminist culture. Her works have  
been published by W. W. Norton  
and Company as well as appear-  
ing in Sinister Wisdom and  
Amazon Quarterly. At times  
when I doubt that I can bear  
the loneliness of being an  
outcast anymore than I could  
bear the alienation of following  
the patterns of the dominant  
culture, I listen to Adrienne  
Rich, who reminds me of my  
truths, a gracious survivor of the  
schizophrenic existence we, who  
call ourselves lesbians, have  
chosen to face.

Talent Show  

By Joyce Cheney  
(Women from the Burling-  
ton community are organizing a  
talent show planned for early  

December. For more informa-  
tion, call Joyce Cheney at  
863-3586.)

So we’re gonna have a talent  

show... Those words are real  
triggers for fear, competition,  
good, bad, succeed, fail. We all  

grew up with these barriers to  
loving ourselves and each other,  
and now have to replace those  
habits with affirming ones.

Old headsets don’t just go  
away. They usually need a kick  
in the ass on the way out — and  
a replacement. So rather than  
leave how the talent show  
“feels” to only goad intentions,  
I want to share some thoughts of  
reorientation. What about a  
“night of sharing,” rather than  
“talent show”? What about —  
instead of “Oh! I didn’t know  
she drew so well/badly” — trying  
an orientation of, “Wow. She's  
really into drawing. It seems to  
be making her feel good.”

It reminds me of when I was  
a camp counselor. Every week  
we had a recital. The atmosphere  
was more supportive of the  
process of sharing and experienc-  
ing than any other in my life.  
Francie, who couldn’t carry a  
tune, got up and sang. The  
crowd — sincerely — went wild,  
seeing her having such a good  

time. Two brothers — having  
practiced long — played their  
band parts to a waltz (second  
clarinet and second cornet play  
oompah, oompah, oompah;  
that’s all). We heard plain  
oompahs for the length of the  

song. The crowd went wild.  
In retrospect, it astounds  
me that such a supportive  

atmosphere was maintained, but  
it was... That's what I hope for  
at our evening of sharing.

Yes, I'll probably like some  
creations better than others.  
Some will better meet my  
listening/looking/etc. needs than  
others. But who am I to say  
what creations have a more  
important part in their creatress’  
self-affirming growth process?

Talent schmalent. We are all  
muses. With time, support, and  
self-confidence, we'll all be  
drawing, dancing, playing, sing-  
ing: we can do it all.

The culture we live in is not  
ours. We are building our own.  
Why judge our womyn process  
and products by the boys’  
standards? I hope we all go to  
this event open to supportively  
receiving the gifts of vulnerabili-  
ty and energy we will be giving  
to each other.

We're going to have a silk  
screen there, so bring a shirt and  
print it with “I’m a Tacky  

Vermont Dyke.”
