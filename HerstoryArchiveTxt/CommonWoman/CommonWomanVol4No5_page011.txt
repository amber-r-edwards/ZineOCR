MUSIC MELANGE  
Michigan '82 by Joyce Shailor  

Traveling to the festival, for  
myself, has always been exciting  
in terms of making new friends  
on the way out; and spinning  
tales of past festivals and  
memories to the new rookies  
who are making the trip for the  
first time; and general process  
and growth around “trying to  
please 2 + X number of womyn  
in the travel group (always an  
amazing, painful, but positive  
process). This year was no  
exception to all these experi-  
ences.  

One remark that stayed  
with me from the trip out was  
when Bear remarked something  
like “A few hundred Hell’s  
Angels can get together and  
pillage and destroy, and it gets  
all over the papers; but when 10  
thousand womyn and children  
get together and co-exist in  
peaceful celebration — nothing  
gets said in the media.”  

Certainly, the dynamics  
around the fact that Michigan  
even works at all is astounding  
and part of the attraction. If you  
can't please three womyn, how  
can you please thousands; but  
there is usually something for  
everyone, and too much going  
on to take all of it in.  

A few improvements I  
found this year: The Sober  
Support Tent was in full opera-  
tion for all womyn from AA,  
WFS (Womyn for Sobriety), and  
other groups. The support I see  
womyn getting around these  
issues is a sign of how good we  
are for one another.  

A second welcome addition  
was DART (Differently Abled  
Resource Tent). The vastness of  
the land this year was trying for  
those of us in good health, but  
the courage and determination  
and stamina of the differently  
abled womyn never ceases to  
amaze me. A representative from  
DART demonstrated that there  
were great difficulties in spite of  
accessibility, and suggested those  
of us with no different abilities  
should spend more time in the  
DART tent. I hope next year  
more womyn will  
their work shift at the DART tent.  

The workshops this year  
boasted an incredible variety  
with many, many topics to  
choose from: coaching, conflict  
resolution, belly-dancing, self-  
defense, stretch & stroll, and  
also political topics like lesbian  
deprogramming, lesbian ethics,  
and a host of others, including  
an ongoing singles workshop.  
My favorite this year (one can  
never get to as many as one  
would like) has to be the two on  
music theory, jazz and be-bop,  
offered by Julie Homi — one of  
the most talented pianists I have  
had the privilege to hear. Julie  
used to play with ALIVE and  
then Thersa Trull, and recently  
with the House Band at the  
festival. Many other fine work-  

shops in the music field were  

also offered for us clandestine  
and serious musicians alike.  

Speaking of the House  
Band, this was an exciting  
concept for me because so many  

of my favorite hot musicians  
were featured, including Jean  

Fineberg on sax and flute, Ellen  
Seeling on trumpet and flugel-  
horn, Nydia Mata on percussion,  
Barbara Bordon (ALIVE) on  
drums! The band added to  
many performances especially  
the Ferron set.  

Speaking of the perfor-  
mances, I felt a little let down  
this year. I think the flat land  
added to the feeling of vastness  
that never encroached on the  
performances at Hesperia in the  
past. I never quite captured the  
unity of the Hesperia perfor-  
mances. However, there were  
some memorable stage happen-  
ings.  

Jasmine, consisting of two  
womyn that are newcomers to  
the Michigan stage, had strong  
vocals and played jazz in the  
swing style of the early 50’s.  
They featured a tight sax and  
brilliant jazz piano. The other  
act that I would single out for an  
extraordinary performance is  
Ferron — whose strength with  
the house behind her was  
phenomenal and she was graced  
with a much more attentive  
audience than last year. She is  
riding on a wave of increased  
exposure and popularity. ‘Ain’t  
life a brook’ — the most moving  
performance to inspire us with  
courage, sadness and to help us  
feel our most intense emotions  
was not Ferron but Dovida  
Ishatova & Henia Goodman.  

Those who are not familiar  
with these two Jewish womyn;  

Cris Williamson in Concert  
By Michiyo Cornell  

I have always thought of  
Cris as a technically fine musi-  
cian and good lyricist with a  
strong, clear singing voice. May-  
be not a whole lot of range  
to her voice but a good voice. At  
the same time, Cris struck me as  
more “spiritual” than “political.”  
(My politics and spirituality are  
intertwined, so the quotation  
marks.) The night of  

October third at the Flynn  
Theatre modified that view  
somewhat.  

I was pleasantly surprised  
that the theme of the evening  
turned out to be the protection  
of the Earth and the interdepen-  
dency of life. “Leviathan” was a  
particularly moving allegory of  
this theme. Women may, like  
some female whales, decide not  
to bring young into the world if  
conditions become unfit for life.  
“Waterfall” became both spiri-  
tual and political in this context:  
if the water continues to be  
destroyed, we won't continue to  
live; if we continue to cling to  
what we have instead of spilling  
over and sharing, there will be  
spiritual death. “Native Dancer”  
was a gentle song about a Native  
American woman who is a  
political prisoner. I don’t mean  
this sarcastically, but I never  
realized that Cris even knew  
there were political prisoners.  
The song about the Nez Perce  
flight to Canada (called Grand-  
mother’s Land -by them because  
of Queen Victoria) was also  
moving.  

For all the kinship I felt  
with the above ideas expressed  

that “human beings invented”  
modern prisons as Cris said, men  
did. I know there are some  
token women allowed power as  
long as they male-identify but it  
is overwhelmingly men who rule  
and decide who goes to prison.  
Also, there were times as in the  
song “Peter Pan” that I felt Cris  
slipped into a too easy “human-  
ist spirituality;” why is child-  
hood so overvalued? I always  
thought of Peter Pan as a little  
brat who refused to face the  
more painful aspects of life  
(which Cris, by the way, does  
seem to do).  

On a more upbeat note,  
I never saw Cris have such an easy  
rapport with an audience before.  
It was obvious that the Burling-  
ton audience appreciated Cris,  
which caused her to say we  
would “spoil” her. She talked  
easily and naturally with the  
audience as when she talked  
about the need for role models  
before her song about Judy  
Collins who was Cris’ role model  
as a musician and singer. Cris  
was ably accompanied by Vicki  
Randal and Tret Fure (or Fury,  
I’ve seen it both ways). All three  
musicians seemed to have a good  
rapport with each other. Both  
the singers did a good job of  
communication; I apologize for  
not getting their names. That's  
all folks.

Cris Williamson at the Flynn  

by Joyce Shailor  
Congratulations to Every-  
womyn’s Productions for nearly  
filling the Flynn. Nice stage set  
up and a successful concert.  
Some of the positive aspects of  
the performance is the chance to  
understand some of the history  
behind the songs. I enjoyed  
hearing about Native Americans  
and unity, and other aspects of  
spirituality that Cris’ lyrics  

always invoke. But the healing  

energy was strangely absent in  
the second set which was very  
commercial; of course she is on  
tour this time to sell her latest  
album. Commercialism got in  
her way; Cris has never been  
known to have great audience  
rapport; but her rudeness a  
couple of times was inexcusable  
and at odds with her lyrics.  
However, her new album is  
important in terms of content  
and it grows on you; but Cris’  
insensitivity really irked me for a  

while.  
The enjoyment of the two  

accompanying musical talents  
was not lost. Tret Fure had a  
very fine guitar back up and  
both she and Vickie are sensitive  
songwriters and also multi-  
talented. The talents of them  
both greatly enhanced the per-  
formance. All in all, it takes a  
great deal of untold energy and  
hours to put such a musical  
package together. Thanks again  
EWP!!  

you a real musical treat!  

Karen Beth is from upstate  
New York. She plays piano,  
accordion and guitar, and is a  
wonderful composer. Her wit,  
humor, and range of styles will  
delight you. Her greatest asset is  
her ability to hold an audience.  

‘Ju by Cris, I felt some differences  
they are classical pianists from  
with her politics. I don’t think

The oral tradition is many  
generations old: it is  
singing and storytelling as a way  
to share news, teach lessons, and  

If you create music (even if  
no one else knows you do)  
please share in a celebration of  
local women’s music. First, we  
entertain ourselves. Singers and  
storytellers used to be our  
neighbors; now, they’re way up  
there on stage, or in a record-  
fantasy stars. It is  
booklets will be available, and  

we can all learn each other’s  

Women could bring tape  

ventures, including  

possibly,  
Maxine Feldman. We promise  

See you there!!

“local records,” to learn the  

songs better, and to just enjoy at  
home.  

Songsharing is a source of  
strength, validation, and fun for  
all of us womon-survivors. If you  
have some songs that will feed us  
and amuse us, and that feel good  
for group singing (being simple  
enough for others to learn)  
please send them. In addition,  
send your favorites!  

If you use written notation, send written-out notes  
and words, along with a tape. If  
you don’t use written music,  
send the words and a tape.  
Include your name, address, and  
phone. Send your songs in by
