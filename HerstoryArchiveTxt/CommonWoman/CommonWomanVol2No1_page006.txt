Beating City Hall

By Meri Furnari

Why take these women
seriously? They're only ruled by
their emotions; scatterbrained

broads! Damsels in distress;
harpies!
But gorgeous gorgons

growled. My Sisters’ Place, Inc.
women put their anger and
exasperation into a civil suit that
has netted the Women’s
Movement a real victory!

In 1975, after three
unsuccessful attempts to sustain
a women’s center in Burlington
and a year of planning meetings,
a group of feminist activists
conceived of My Sisters’ Place.
Its purpose was to be a women’s
center financially maintained by
an operating business rather than
the draining, short-lived past
methods of volunteer labor,

donations, pledges, grants and

the like.
Aside from women’s needs for

a meeting place, resource and
information center that a
women’s center usually provides,
a recreational and cultural space
was wanted. The needs were
clear and the idea developed that
a restaurant and possibly a bar
could be the business means to
achieving most of these ends.
Prior to renting a seemingly
suitable space for this pioneer
endeavor, representatives of My
Sisters’ Place (Linda Wittenberg
and Meri Furnari) met with Fire
Department Inspector John
Vincent in June, 1975. After
explaining their intentions, the
women relied on the city’s fire
agent to indicate the proper
courses of action. Three months
ensued with dozens of

Burlington area residents

working on many levels: task,

forces for renovation, market

research, corporate structuring,
administration, personnel, and
capital investment were among
the responsibilities.

By September, 1975, My
Sisters’ Place was ready to call

on the further offer of help if

“we had any questions” put out
by Lieutenant Vincent. To
MSP’s shock and dismay, the
women heard, “You girls can’t
have a bar up here; no ‘place of
assembly’ is allowable on the

The original suit requested
roughly $25,000 in damages.
Last month, Judge Ernest

Gibson awarded MSP $6073,
plus court costs. The trial in
Chittenden County Superior
Court this summer presented the
judge with unequivocal proof
that My Sisters’ Place had lost
$2138.23 in out-of-pocket
expenditures, and $3973.50 for
services rendered by contract
labor.

“Gibson found Vincent
immune, but not the city,” said
Burlington's attorney Tony
Lamb when he learned of the
court's decision in MSP’s favor.
For this reason, he believes the
city must appeal the case for
fear that “every city in the state
of Vermont will be liable every
time a zoning board or other
body makes a mistake.”

Mary Just Skinner from
Montpelier, who recently was
elected to the State Legislature,
won the case for MSP based on
an argument known in legalese
as “promissory estoppel.” Ms.
Skinner asserted, “In Vermont it
is well established that an agent,
acting within the scope of
his/her employment, binds the
principal.” She accepted MSP's
case on contingency.

TOKENISM: Opiate of the
Oppressed

By Joyce Slayton Mitchell

(Excerpted from a speech given
in 1976 at the Northeastern

Regional Conference of the
National Organization for
Women.)

What is it that keeps the

Equal Rights Amendment from
us — when we have been trying
to get it since 1923? What is it
that makes the Women’s Rights
Convention at Seneca Falls,
N.Y., in 1848 relevant today?
What is it that requires the
second wave of feminism to be
still working on the very
demands (other than the vote)
of Elizabeth Cady Stanton and
Lucretia Mott?

What is it that keeps women
aspiring so much below men?

What is it that keeps us
working on equal pay for equal
work, equality in employment,
child care, more female doctors,
lawyers and car dealers, rather
than talking about a revolution
where we can expect a full
employment policy in America?

What is it that permits
professional associations to have
a women’s caucus or a study of
women and never change the
sexist structure of the
professional association?

What is it in us that condones
the sexist status of law in
Vermont that requires a
woman's unpaid labor for life in
exchange for board and room,
according to the man’s
definition of board and room;
that makes a woman lose
freedom of mobility and
residence; that upholds in the
courts a man’s rights for sexual
intercourse and yet does not
uphold in court the woman’s
demand for love and affection as

promised in the marriage
ceremony?
What is it that makes the

romantic needs of the oppressed
so clear to businesses which
profit from 20 million women
watching the soap operas and
added millions reading the
romantic Harlequin novels that
are produced to the tune of
eight a month with a waiting list
so long that the newsstands can’t
even get them on the counter?

What is it that encourages
committees to study the status
of women in the church and
deny ordination on the basis of
sex?

What is it that calls for a
celebration in 1976 for the first
woman full professor at
Middlebury College since 1800?
That celebrates the first woman

president of Smith College while
a woman president at Columbia,
Amherst or Williams wouldn't
even cross anyone's mind? What
is it that celebrates the first
woman superintendent of
schools in a school system when
only 6% of school
superintendents, nationwide, are
women; when only 3% of all
public school principals are
women — in a predominantly
female field of employment?
What is it that causes us to
celebrate these male-determined,

miniscule, inconsequential,
insignificant, trivial, false
symbols of progress toward

equality that they decide to

give? What is it?

Sisters, it's TOKENISM. And
TOKENISM IS THE OPIATE
OF THE OPPRESSED!
Tokenism is used to relieve pain,
to cause dullness, to cause
inaction, to soothe feelings, to
stupefy, to sedate. Tokenism is
to placate, to pacify. Tokenism
takes women’s resentment and
rebellion directed toward
revolution and turns it around to
mild reform.

Tokenism IS the Governor's
Commission on the Status of
Women.

Tokenism IS the professional
associations’ women’s caucus.

Tokenism IS the romance in
marriage.

Tokenism IS the committee
for the ordination of women.

Tokenism IS the one woman
full professor at a college.

Tokenism IS the nun on the
board of Gulf Oil.

Tokenism IS the one woman
superintendent of schools in the
state.

Tokenism IS the legislative
study committee on the ERA.

Tokenism IS the one woman
vice president in the public
relations firm.

Tokenism IS the husband
“helping” with “your”
housework.

Tokenism IS the foundations’
crumbs to the starving.

Tokenism toward women is
just the sideshow off the main
event of our country’s power
struggle for control, wealth and
material goods. It is only the
white male who has access to
our resources and the power to
mobilize these resources. It is
the white male who dominates
the corporate centers of

technology. It is the white male
who is over-represented in the
institutions designed to regulate
that power — the military,
courts, police, and all levels of
government. It is the white male
who decides to have wars, which
wars we will fight, and for how
long. Our history books are a
description of these male wars
and the distribution of wealth
and power.

It is the white male who
decides how much money will
be spent for war, for health,
energy, research, and which
research will get priority. Will
the big money go to the race for
nuclear arms? Or to medical
research for the cure of heart
disease, or stomach cancer or
breast cancer, or for the
mysteries of menopause? The
exploitation and oppression of
women isn't even a
consideration in the wars that
really count, or the decisions on
access to power; women are only
property in the male acting out
of power roles.

Tokenism is the oppressor’s
way to perpetuate sexism.
Tokenism treats the symptoms
of sexism. Treating the
symptoms makes us feel better,
but it isn’t the cure. Women are
not aware that men don’t know
our culture and there is no way
that men — even feminist men —
can cure sexism by tokenism.

The oppressed react to
tokenism by inaction on crucial
changes needed in the structure
of our sexist institutions. For
example, rebellion and
resentment in the home win

tokens of romance or shared
housework instead of dealing
