“Most people who come  
here are women,” Ben Blood,  
director of the Emergency Food  
Shelf located at 191 North  
Street, confided to me at the  
end of my interview with him. I  
mentioned the ‘feminization of  
poverty” (a higher percentage of  
families living below the poverty  
level are headed by women than  
by men) and he didn’t respond. I  
thought of cutbacks in social  
services and the over-inflated  
military budget; I thought of  
building new prisons in econo-  
mic depressions and recessions.  
Doesn't anyone link up food and  
crime, hard times and the  
compulsion to steal?

The Emergency Food Shelf  
helps to alleviate that a little.  
The major requirement for get-  
ting food from the Food Shelf is  
to be hungry. About half the  
people coming in are self-  
referred; the other half are  
referred by Welfare, the Salva-  
tion Army, churches and other  
places. The people, mostly  
women, are generally between  
seventeen and forty years of age.  
They are single women with  
children, transients, young  
women and men thrown out of  

their homes, elderly people who  
paid food money for fuel or  
people who are just plain down  
“on their luck.

When a woman comes in,  
she is seated and an intake  
interview is done by Ben Blood,  
one of his two assistants (Tony  
Montana or Ken Folson) or one  
of ten volunteers who staff the  
office. This is done for two  
reasons: to determine if the  
person really needs the food and  
to be able to refer them to other  
agencies that can take over once

the emergency need is met.  
Since it is an EMERGENCY  
outlet, people usually don’t  
receive food for more than three  
days at a time and more than  
twice in thirty days.

Ben Blood emphasized the  
Food Shelf program is not an  
extension of the Welfare Depart-  
ment. Between the Community  
Action Program and United  
Way, all of the Food Shelf’s rent  
and administration costs are paid  
so that all food and money  
donations are turned directly  
over to the people who come in  
for food. The need is greater  
than better-off people may ima-  
gine. In June 1982, for example,  
334 households with 770 family  
members were given food. Of  
these, about 200 people needed  
to be fed directly since they  
didn’t have access to cooking  
facilities for food.

‘We try to convey a sense  
of caring. Many people who  
come here have had little love or  
caring in their lives. We try to  
give them a sense that someone  
in the world cares,” Ben Blood  
told me. I thought of hunger at a  
time when some farmers are paid  
not to plant food, at a time  
when we produce more than  

“enough food to feed North  
America and I feel angry and  
sickened.

There are three other Emer-  
gency Food Shelves in this  
general area. One is located at  
the United Church of Hinesburg,  
another at the Richmond Mis-  
cellany Mart and the Milton  
Food Shelf is at the Thrift Shop  
on Route 7. We can help them  
by contributing food and/or  
money and also telling people  
who may need it that the Food  
Shelf exists.

On the morning of Septem-  
ber 22, police found the cannon  
in Battery Park painted pink and  
embellished with a head and  
balls to resemble the sexual  
organ of a white male. On its  
side was stenciled ‘Gross  
National Product” and graffiti  
on the bandshell added, “Stop  
Phallic Death” and “Castrate the  
Defense Budget.” HEXON (Hags  
Enraged X-ing Out Nuclear  
nationalists), an anti-corpora-  
tion, initiated the action and  
issued the following statement:

We perform this action to  
point out the connections be-  
tween male violence and mili-  
tarism. It’s no accident that an  
instrument of death (the can-  
non, a gun) is so easily trans-  
formed into male genitalia, an  
instrument of rape. War is rape  
and rape is war. We draw these  
connections to show our aware-  
ness of this pervasive, invasive  
sensibility. Weapons are techno-  
logical penis extenders. Patriar-  
chy is size crazy. Men compare  
organs and men compare sizes of  
missiles. No matter that there  
are enough weapons to annihi-  
late the planet, they still want to  
make sure they have the biggest.  
The Gross National Product of  
this country is based on war,  
death and destruction. The GNP  
reflects an economy based on

corporations kept afloat by the  
state, through taxes taken from  
the people and given to the  

corporations as defense con-  
tracts continue to manufacture  
overkill.

The dominant male culture  
is violent and pornographic and  
these aspects are totally inter-  
twined. The numbing threat of  
nuclear annihilation is always in  
our minds. The newspeak of  
1984 is here. In the name of  
security we are threatened with  
nuclear war, in the name of  
peace, men make war. Everyday  
we face blatant woman hating,  
whether it is the Reagan  
administration feminizing poverty or the  
AM radio popularizing sado-  
masochism like the song “Hurt  
So Good” so popular now.

We say axe the defense  
budget, put an end to the idea of  
national virility as a “defensive  
attitude” to the slogan “an erect  
penis has no conscience.” That’s  
what rape is all about. We act so  
that others may make connec-  
tions in their lives between what  
is rigid and what kills and  
deadens feelings. We act in the  
belief that naming the truth of  
the prevailing male mode is the  
first step to ending it. We  
encourage women to speak what  
they know of male violence. A  
hex on phallic imperialism!

Everywoman’s Place has just  
received a very generous gift of  
eight photographs from Joan  
Knight. The photographs are of  
“Women at Work” and were part  
of Joan's photography show at  
EWP.

At its last meeting, the  
collective decided to hang these  
photos on the walls in the  
central meeting space as part of  
the permanent decor.

We want to thank Joan and  
also the other women who have  
so kindly contributed art objects  
to Everywoman’s Place.
