Do you know the feeling of ecstasy when your mind, emotions, and physical being are in harmony? These weekends offer you an opportunity for discussion, intensive group work, physical development, and recreation. Growth through a variety of therapeutic modalities, sharing, and feedback will be interspersed with conditioning and loving self-defense.  

Recreation will include walks/hiking, bonfires and “New Games.”  

Come join us in a search for balance!
