more On Nicaragua

Against the atmosphere of raised hopes based on tangible
social and economic strides in Nicaragua, there is an overriding
fear of — and preparation for — an impending invasion from Hon-
duras with heavy U.S. backing. In fact, a state of war already
exists in the form of almost daily attacks on farm workers and

others by Contras (counterrevolutionaries, mostly former Somoza
* National Guardsmen). The Nicaraguans as well as the people of
« the United States will be very lucky if this continuing warfare
doesn’t escalate into another Vietnam. Besides information
S gathering projects like the NEP (Nicaraguan Education Project)
§ there are continuing brigades of Americans, Canadians, Western
, Europeans and others going to Nicaragua to help harvest coffee

§ and other crops, to work in education and health care, and to
~ simply provide a witness for peace along the Honduran border
* just inside Nicaragua. A group from Vt. will go for the first two
+ weeks of Feb. Many of us hope and pray that this army of
a civilians may, by the miracle of common sense, provide the
leverage needed to move government decision makers away
M from their preoccupation with futile military solutions to social
rf. and economic problems. Interested Vermonters should contact

terrorize

The following report was origin-
ally printed in the Daily Hampshire
Gazette, Northampton, MA, Nov. 26,
1983. The women mentioned each
sent an article to Commonwomon,

By Stephen Lyons

Even before they landed in
Tegucigalpa, Rose A. Markham
and Ruth E. Hawkins could
sense the presence in Central
America: Their commercial air-
liner was filled with American
servicemen, thinly disguised in
civilian clothes.

Once on the ground in the

capital of Honduras, the two
Northampton women learned
that some 5,000 U.S. troops

were already assembled there
and that 6,000 more were due
shortly for military exercises
that would include a mock
amphibious assault on the coun-
try’s Caribbean shore.

Asked to explain the build-

up, a U.S. military attache
assured the women that the
troops were there only to

protect the Hondurans in the
event of an attack from neigh-
boring Nicaragua.

But when they
arrived in Nicaragua two days
later, they found a country

whose people are bracing for a

U.S.-backed invasion. ‘They
didn’t hesitate to say, ‘We are

fearful. We are nervous because

we know this attack is com-
ing,’’ Mrs. Hawkins recalled.

On arriving in the capital
city of Managua, the two North-

ampton women were struck by the
extent to which the threat of
a U.S. invasion overshadows
Nicaraguan life.

Before going to their regular
jobs, workers spend a few hours
each morning digging the bun-
kers and trenches that will serve
as shelters if the attack should
come. On the front pages of two
major newspapers, photographs
show children practicing the
evacuation to the shelters. And
headlines scream of new fighting
in the northern provinces.

Operating from camps with-
in Honduras, a force of counter-
revolutionaries — many of whom
were members of the National
Guard of the former dictator
Anastasio Somoza — have been
making repeated border raids in
an effort to destabilize the
Sandinistas who came to power
in Nicaragua by overthrowing
Somoza in 1979.

The Sandinistas whom the
two women met are confident

they can repel an attack by the

“contras,” even by the Hondu-
ran military. What troubles them
is that the United States, which
has a long history of using
military force to protect its
interests in Central America, is
openly supporting the counter-
revolutionary effort.

Women’s Peace
Walk

Florida women, joined by
women from other states, are
walking 530 miles from Gaines-
ville, Florida to Key West to rally
southeastern support for peace
actions. The walking women will
speak with citizens in over 90
cities and towns along their
route to encourage non-violent

protest of worldwide U.S. mili-
tarism. The women’s peace walk,
originating December 17 from
Gainesville’s downtown Plaza,
plans to reach Orlando on
Christmas day for a 7 p.m. vigil
at the gates of the Martin-
Marietta weapons plant. Key
West is chosen as the walk’s
ultimate destination to demon-
strate unity with Central and
South American women and
children who are suffering the
violent effects of U.S. military
intervention. Two women from
Vermont, Deane Brittingham
and Kris Druman, are walking
with the group.

This essay is FREE and can be

envelope should be enclosed.

Here are some excerpts:

“The U.S. has 610,000 lawyers,
two-thirds of the world’s total and
almost three times as many as in
1951.”

- “In 1981, law practices took in
$24.1 billion dollars or 0.9% of the
gross national product, more than the
air-transport industry and one fifth as
much as the health-services eco-

nomy."

“ There are close to 20,000
(completely innocent) men, women,
and juveniles locked up in our prisons
and jails, who are compelled to
struggle anywhere from two to six
years before the truth will surface.
Most end up doing their full sen-
tence, their voices heard by deaf ears,
greedy unethical lawyers, and a very
ignorant, prejudiced, and blind pub-
lic. This does not even begin to
describe the bitterness, sorrow, and
misery to those 29,000 victims’
families and loved ones.”

AIDS

AIDS

Tragedy is stalking our
community. But for some peo-
ple, that’s not enough.

It’s not enough that the gay
community is threatened by a
fatal disease — AIDS. AIDS is
becoming the latest cover for
discrimination.

And it’s not just those who
have AIDS who are the targets.
AIDS is being used as a smoke-
screen for discrimination against
you, against me, and against
every gay man and lesbian in the
United States.

First, let me tell you about
the kind of discrimination AIDS
patients face:

—Insurance companies are
refusing to pay for AIDS treat-
ment — claiming it is “experi-
mental.”

—In California, Medi-Cal
refuses to pay for medication for
some AIDS patients. These
patients didn’t start out on
Medi-Cal. They're on it because
they were forced to quit their
jobs and lost their health insur-
ance — because they had AIDS.

—A physician told one gay
man who has AIDS that he is
able to work. But his employer
suspended him anyway — other
employees were afraid they’d
catch AIDS.

Every day, AIDS patients
are facing fear and discri-
mination within the medical
institutions that are supposed to
treat them. Discrimination that
robs them of dignity. Discri-
mination that slows down the
search for a cure for AIDS each
time an “experimental” treat-
ment is curbed. Discrimination
that may even shorten the
patient’s life.

There’s a way to fight this
discrimination — in court. And
the time to take these issues into
the courts is now — to set
precedents that will ban this
type of discrimination against
AIDS patients.
