I swear it to you  

I swear it on my common woman’s head  
The common woman is as common as a common loaf of bread —

the Right to Choose  
. 20.  

and Dialogue From A Feminist Perspective  

By Barnee Escott  

On January 23, 1973, the  
U.S. Supreme Court handed  
down two landmark decisions  
affirming women’s right to  
abortion. In these two cases,  
Roe v. Wade and Doe v. Bolton,  
the Court ruled that a woman  
has a constitutional right to  
choose, in consultation with her  
doctor, whether or not to  
terminate a pregnancy. This  
simply means that: abortion is  
legal; that during the first  
trimester of pregnancy, the  
decision to terminate the  
pregnancy is left solely to the  
woman and her physician; that a  
married woman does not need  
her husband’s consent, or a  
minor her parents’ consent, for  
the abortion; and that any  
public hospital which provides  
obstetrical and gynecological  

“Bye, Bye Bella!”

Bella Abzug, recently fired by  
Jimmy Carter as co-chairwoman  
of the National Advisory  
Committee for Women, now  
joins Midge Costanza as a  
feminist leader purged from and  
by the Carter administration. In  
a strong display of solidarity,  
over half of the 40-member  
committee, including co-chair  
Carmen Delgao Votaw, have  
resigned in protest and the  
future of the women’s rights  
panel is uncertain.  

If Carter had hoped to start  
the new year off right by  
improving his already shaky  
support from women, he seems  
to have made a very poor start.  
Any hope of even an uneasy  
peace with the women’s  
movement has all but  
disappeared with this latest  
administrative blunder. It seems  
clear that the President chooses  
to surround himself with  
political “yes men” and has a  
particularly low tolerance for  
“nay saying women.” Abzug was  
fired abruptly after she issued a  
statement from the Advisory  

Committee discussing the  
disastrous effects on women that  
would result from Carter’s  
proposed inflation-fighting  
program.  

Even the timing of the firing  
seemed characteristic of Ham  
“Hatchetman” Jordon’s  
humiliation tactics, previously  
used to oust Midge Costanza  
from her Cabinet post. Abzug  
had just finished a news  
conference where she had  
diplomatically described the  
committee’s meeting with Carter  
as “productive,” and was  
stunned when she was then  
handed the terse four-line “pink  
slip.”  

The National Advisory  
Committee for Women was  
formed last spring to advise the  
administration on women’s  
issues and to continue the work  
of the National Woman's  
Conference held in November,  
1977, in Houston, Tex.  
Relations between the White  
House and the committee have  
been periodically stormy. In  
November, 1978, the group  
declined a meeting with the

care facilities for deliveries must  
provide facilities for abortions.  
In other words, that it is the  
right of the individual woman,  
according to her personal beliefs  
and with medical advice, to  
choose whether or not to  
terminate a pregnancy or carry it  
to term.  

This set of historic decisions,  
which made abortions a legal  
medical procedure, seemed to  
forever end the “backdoor  
butchery” of illegal abortionists  
by providing medically safe  
abortions. No longer would  
thousands of women risk their  
health and even their lives in  
self-induced or “kitchen-table”  
abortions. But did it?  

In 1976, Congress passed the  
Hyde Amendment to the 1977  
Labor/Health, Education and  
Welfare Appropriations bill.

Imagine Our  
Surprise  

By Linda Wittenberg  

Holly Near and friends, in an  
amazing, surprising  
woman-identified celebration,  
performed before over 500  
women and men in a Lebanon,  
N.H., benefit for the New  
England Clamshell Alliance  
recently. Audience energy and  
participation was high as Holly,  
accompanied by J. T. Thomas  
on piano, stirred us with her  
songs of political struggle we  
have lived and sung. Holly’s  
music mirrored the political  
awakening of many of us in the  
audience. She reviewed her  
process and growth and  
validated our own.  

Timothy Near, Holly’s sister,  
about whom she writes in the  
song “You’ve Got Me Flyin” (on  
her You Can Know All I Am  
album) was at the concert and  
performed with Holly. Timothy,  
part of a dance troupe which  
does interpretative dance and  
signing for the deaf, danced and  
signed as Holly sang “Water  
Come Down” and “You've Got  
Me Flyin.” The energy between  
these two women working  
together, their very obvious love  
and respect for each other, filled  
the audience with the intense  
emotion of the songs.  

Holly progressed in her music  
and narrative to a point where  
she began to explain her need to  
incorporate women and  
women's lives, separate from  
men, into her life. She talked  

Holly Near Concert  

and sang about her woman  
identification growing strong to  
the point of opening up a  
coming out as a lesbian. One  
woman in the audience  
commented on Holly’s “coming  
out” before the large mixed  
audience, saying, “That took  
guts!” Holly replied that it took  
less guts for her than for  
someone who works at J. C.  
Penny’s.
