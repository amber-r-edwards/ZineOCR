Other Ways of Healing  

I think radiation protection  
and healing can also be accom-  
plished by emotional and psy-  
chic methods. Holistic health is a  
view acknowledging the connec-  
tions between emotion, spirit,  
way of life and the physical state  
of the body. For example, too  
much emotional stress can cause  
a person to get sick. Separating  
body from mind and spirit is a  
part of the white man’s culture  
and damages everyone. Other  
cultures have long known about  
this unity and used it in healing.  
Physical sickness can be helped  
to heal by deliberately focusing  
on emotional and spiritual  
states. We can help heal our  
bodies, and each other’s bodies  
with our minds and emotions. I  
believe these are very powerful  
tools of healing and can also be  
used in the political struggle,  
to help heal and develop a better  
relationship with the earth.  
People trying out emotional and  
psychic ways of healing and  
protection should go at a com-  
fortable pace — don’t scare  
yourself. Think first about parts of  
yourself you already feel good  
about. Think about how much  
you like these parts, how strong,  
how soft they are, etc. Give  
yourself affection. Imagine your-  
self a child of the earth. Then  
begin to think about the places  
in your body that need health,  
that need attention. Imagine  
them relaxing, becoming warm  
and healthy — filled with light,  
or a special healing color or  
energy. Whatever images help —  

If you are working with  
someone else, imagine these  
processes happening inside them.  
Send them warmth and health  
from the earth and sky through  
your hands. Ask friends to  
talk to you. Use the ways that  
seem helpful to you or change  
them to suit you. I am  
sharing here a couple of specific  
healing techniques, but many  
exist — more than one person  
could list. There are many  
resource books for this kind  
of healing and many ways of  
going about it. They are all  
probably effective, so it’s a  
matter of trying out, inventing,  
and using what seems most  
valuable to you.  

Images: If you know you’ve  
been exposed to radiation, or  
anytime you feel the need, take  
time to deliberately imagine  
your body as healthy and strong.  
Think first about parts of  
yourself you already feel good  
about. Think about how much  
you like these parts, how strong,  
how soft they are, etc. Give  
yourself affection. Imagine your-  
self a child of the earth. Then  
begin to think about the places  
in your body that need health,  
that need attention. Imagine  
them relaxing, becoming warm  
and healthy — filled with light,  
or a special healing color or  
energy. Whatever images help —  

psychic ways of healing and  
certain color, an outlet for  
anger. If you are working with  
someone else, imagine these  
processes happening inside them.

Nature: I find the earth to  
be a sustaining force. Contact  
with nature is calming and  
reminds us of what we're fight-  
ing for and how strong the  
earth is. The way of life of  
Native peoples is strongly linked  
to the earth: a source of  
strength, life and power. Imper-  
ialism and the white man’s  
culture has been to separate and  
alienate people from nature,  
robbing us of our life source.  
Nature can teach us new ways of  
living and help us run radiation  
out of our bodies. You don’t  
have to live in the country to  
make nature a part of your life.  
There are many ways to do this  
and every people's culture has its  
own manner of touching the  
earth. Group picnics, vegetable  
gardens, soccer in the park, kids  
playing in the street, keeping  
animals, working outside, walk-  
ing and sitting on the porch.  
Think of more yourself.  
Meditation: Various forms  
of meditation can be calming,  
relaxing and centering which all,  
help. The meditation described  
here involved “running energy” —  
a process of moving energy in  
and out of the body, which I  
think is especially useful in  
getting rid of radiation. This  
meditation works best sitting in  
a chair, but can actually be done  
in any position; standing, lying  
down, sitting in a wheelchair —  
however you can. The most  
important thing is opening the  
energy centers.  

Get in a relaxed position.  
Take off your shoes and put  
your feet flat on the floor if you  
can, or rest them on a solid  
surface. Close your eyes and  
rest your hands on your thighs.  
Relax, relax your breathing.  
Imagine an energy center in your  
abdomen — in the middle of  
your body from back to front  
between your belly button and  
pubic area — right between the  
ovaries. Imagine a center of  
energy — a little circle — there  
actually is one — and send a cord  
from there down to the center  
of the earth. Imagine it as a  
cord, rope, beam of light, root —  
whatever you imagine best. It  
goes right down from your body  
energy center, through the floor,  
the concrete, the ground and  
into the earth. At the center of  
the earth the cord wraps around  
the earth, fuses with it and  
grows into it — letting the  
energy from your body flow  
into the earth where it is neutra-  
lized and used for life. Your  
body energy moves through the  
center in your abdomen and out  
into the earth — especially  
tensions, fears, radiation, etc.  

Relax, let it be easy, don’t  
push yourself. Imagine it hap-  
pening and it will.  

Now, imagine energy centers  
in the bottoms of your feet,  
right in the middle of each foot.  
These spots grow warm and  
open up, letting energy from  
the earth flow into your body.  
The earth comes up through the  
concrete, the floor, the third  
story of your building and into  
your feet. Sometimes it helps to  
imagine the earth — grass, trees,  
stars, while you're doing this.  
Feel the earth's energy move  
into your feet, up your legs, into  
your knees, your thighs, your  
hips and go through the center  
in your stomach and back down  
to the center of the earth. You  
now have a complete flow of  
energy moving through your  
body. You are grounded. Take a  
little break.  

When you're ready ground  
yourself again. Now imagine a  
triangle in the top of your head —  
about two-thirds of the way  
back from your forehead. An  
energy center is there. Feel it  
tingle and open up. Take in the  
energy from the universe  
through the top of your head —  
the air, the sky, the stars.  
Imagine it as a flow down  
through your body — your neck,  
shoulders, arms, chest, back and  
out into the earth through the  
center in your belly. Some of it  
will also spurt back up and out  
the top of your head. Don’t try  
too hard, just imagine it as easy  
and you can do it.  

This meditation can move  
radiation, sickness and tension  
out of your body and into the  
earth where it is neutralized. It is  
renewing — and brings in new,  
healthy life energy.  

Group: Rituals, gatherings,  
and ceremonies can add their  
power to the individual to  
protect against radiation,  
strengthen the political struggle,  
and create change. I’m not  
prepared to describe ways of  
doing this because I haven't  
really participated in many my-  
self. People can always design  
their own, drawing from their  
own cultural rituals and from  
other cultures.  

This is all the information I  
have on radiation protection at  
present. If anyone has any other  
information, I’d appreciate hear-  
ing from you so I can add to or  
change this article.

report on Haitian Refugees  

Despite the fact that Am-  
nesty International has written  
to the Reagan administration  
about deporting Haitian refugees  
who would face torture and  
imprisonment on their return to  
Haiti, Reagan has insisted on a  
“get tough” policy of turning  
the refugees back to Haiti.  
Reagan claims the refugees are  
not political refugees and that  
Jean-Claude Duvalier, who is  
President-for-Life of Haiti suc-  
ceeding his father in 1971, has  
personally assured Reagan that  
there is no political repression  
going on in Haiti.  

The Haitian women being  
detained in the United States as  
illegal immigrants are held in  
eight federal prisons in New  
York, Kentucky, West Virginia  
and Texas and at federal immi-  
gration centers in Miami, Brook-  
lyn and Fort Allen, Puerto Rico.  
The Haitian women report tales  
of horror both while they were  
in Haiti and while being held in  
United States detention. The  

Haitians speak of political  
repression by the Volunteers for  
National Security popularly  
known as the ton-ton macoutes  
who can jail, torture and kill  
Haitian people for questioning  
any aspect of Duvalier’s regime  
which may include questioning  
why unions are not allowed,  
why newspaper reporters and  
editors, trade union leaders,  
teachers and activists of all kinds  
disappear. One woman reported  
being jailed for refusing to have  
sexual relations with a ton-ton  
macoute. Another woman's hus-  
band disappeared and the  
woman was threatened with  
death if she didn’t close up the  
small family shop and leave the  
country.  

Many Haitian refugees leave  
Haiti by airplane or by boat.  
Boats are more risky, often  
being unsafe and overcrowded.  
Many of the Haitian women  
report little food and no liquid  
to drink other than their own  
urine; many refugees don’t make  
it alive to U.S. shores. Instead,  
their bodies are washed up on  
the beaches of Florida. The  
women risk all this, often with  
their children because conditions  
are so bad in Haiti.  

“They came here hoping to  
be freed from political repres-  
sion only to find that racism and  
sexism imprison them in the  
United States. When they are  
caught by the Immigration and  
Naturalization Service (INS),  
they are separated from their  
children and husbands. Some  
women who were pregnant were  
forcibly aborted so they could  
not stay on the grounds of  
having a child who is a U.S.  
citizen. They report inadequate  
meals and medical care and  
mistreatment by prison guards.  
All this, despite the fact the  
women are not being detained as  
criminals. The women also  
report being sent into solitary  
confinement and forced to work  
for a dollar a day on prison  
projects. They are only allowed  
to correspond with or call  
relatives and no one else. There  
are no warrants for their arrests  
and no definable jail sentences.  
They are told they cannot apply  
for political asylum or appeal  
INS decisions.  

Such conditions have led  
some refugees to attempt or to  
commit suicide. This has been  
done by hanging, using razors to  
slash their wrists or by eating  
broken glass.  

Some refugees agreed or  
were tricked into going back to  
Haiti only to have their families  
in Haiti write to the U.S. federal  
prison or detention center as if  
the refugees had not been sent  
back to Haiti. This raised the  
question of where and how the  
refugees disappeared on getting  
back to Haiti. In the meantime,  
sympathetic North Americans  
are trying to provide legal and  
moral support to the imprisoned  
Haitian women.
