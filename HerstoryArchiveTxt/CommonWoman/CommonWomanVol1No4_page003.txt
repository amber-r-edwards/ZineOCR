EAMES  
CHRISTMAS  

WRAP  

By Dian Kendrick Mueller  

(The following is a  
conversation about Christmas  
held by a group of women; some  
names have been changed.)  

DIAN: Christmas was always  
an exciting time to me when I  
was a child — the whole myth  
and tradition of Christmas, the  
idea of Santa Claus coming in his  
sleigh and the Christmas dinner  
and the plum pudding and so on.  

Then, throughout my teens,  
Christmas became very boring,  
because there wasn’t any  
mystery and there didn’t seem  
to be any magic. I knew there  
wasn't a Santa Claus, so I figured  
there wasn’t any Jesus Christ  
either, and if there wasn't a  
Jesus Christ, then I wasn’t that  
sure about God.  

But when I had my own kids  
and was making Christmas for  
them, when they were young  
enough to believe in Santa Claus,  
it was very exciting in a different  

way, wondering how they'd  
react on Christmas morning  
when they saw the tree and  

unwrapped the presents. Of  
course, Robert and I were up all  
night decorating the tree and  
wrapping packages, so I'd sit  
there like the ghost at the feast  
in the morning because I really  
wouldn't be in a very good  
mood after a sleepless night.  

Now that the children are  
older, it isn’t as exciting as it  
used to be, but there are some  
traditional things that we  
continue to do that are pleasant.  

ELLEN: How will you feel  
about Christmas without the  
children?  

DIAN: You mean looking  
into the future, how will I feel?  
What I think is that when the  
children aren't there, there’s  
going to be a bleak period when  
I'm going to wonder if it’s  
worthwhile decorating the tree  
and all that stuff. And then —  
perhaps — I’ll have  
grandchildren, which will be  
pleasant. For me, Christmas does  
depend on children — either  
being a child myself or having  
children of my own that are  
young enough to be excited  
about the whole thing.  

A lot of the things about  
Christmas are a pain in the ass —  
for instance, I don’t like having  
to do all the cooking on  
Christmas day, so that I’m stuck  
in the kitchen with this stupid  
turkey while everyone else is  
having fun. Another thing is  
that, no matter how much effort  
you put into it, Christmas can  
turn out shitty just because  
someone gets up in a bad mood.  

LINDA: Well, that’s because  
that day doesn’t have any  
significance whatsoever, other  
than that someone chose a day. I  
mean, most people don’t  
celebrate it really religiously, so  
it's not like there’s a feeling  
inside people, like “It’s  
Christmas!” The feeling is “I’m  
going to get presents and a big  
meal—"  

BYMMY: No, no, Linda.  
Christmas was very religious for  
my grandfather. He'd go to  
midnight mass — he was a  
Catholic — and he would also go  

to mass the next day. And my  

mother was an atheist, so it  
meant terrible battles around  
Christmas time.  

Christmas for me is many  
good and bad memories. On the  
good side, I remember a lot of  
attempts at joyfulness and fun. I  
grew up in a big city and  
Christmas was the time when a  
living tree got put into the living  
room and there was this smell of  
pine... And we always made our  
own ornaments and I remember  
the excitement of making  
ornaments and presents, and the  
excitement of secretly and  
clandestinely breaking into  
presents seven days before  
Christmas and then wrapping  
them up again real carefully so  
that no one would know.  

And I remember all the  
women folk of my family  
feverishly working on food and  
my family was the kind that  
made plum puddings and  
shipped them off — I mean they  
could have started a business.  
You could smell plum puddings  
baking for weeks, I think these  
women folk enjoyed cooking up  
to a point, and then I think it  
started getting very feverish and  
“are we going to beat the  
deadline” kind of thing.  

Christmases in my family  
were mammoth get-togethers; it  
was never three or four people,  
it was always 25 people getting  
together for this mammoth  
meal. When you think of all  
these different personalities  
getting together and drinking —  
and drinking is a problem with  
some of my relatives — and then  
getting into discussions that  
always turned into these terrible  
fights... I can remember people  
arguing and getting up from  
Christmas dinner and leaving and  
saying, “I never want to see you  
again,” and slamming the door.  
Somehow that puts a damper on  
the evening.  

Something that I became  
aware of very young — like  
around 10 — was that after the  
festivities it was all of again —  
the women folk who cleaned up.  

It took days. And the men  
would just sit down and start  
watching these football games  
on television. There was no  
feedback from them for all of  
the work that got put in by the  
women. They never even  
thought of helping, whereas I  
never thought of not helping.  

Christmas for me now is very  
different. It’s a period of a  
different kind of spirituality, of  
getting in touch with my needs  
and maybe getting away from  
people — that doesn’t sound like  
Christmas, does it? But anyway,  
I think that Christmas is a time  
for spending with very close  
friends, maybe two or three; it’s  
not a family thing.  

CAROL: I'm Jewish, but my  
parents owned a drugstore and  
so Christmas was big. I think  
they gave in to consumerism,  
because we did have a Christmas  
gift thing. I’d get up in the  
morning and there’d be a  
stocking on the fireplace and we  
would exchange presents. But  
that was it — no tree or big  
dinner.  

ELLEN: Did you get real  
angry, like at school when kids  
were singing Christmas carols?  

CAROL: No. I participated in  
the annual Christmas pageant. I  
was slightly embarrassed, but  
there were enough slightly  
embarrassed Jews around so that  
I could get by.  

But when I got married and  
had children, I didn’t want to  
repeat that same kind of  
ambivalence about Christmas, so  
I decided no Christmas, period.  
And at that point I felt a real  
exemption and it was kind of  
neat to watch everybody  
scurrying around and going  
crazy while I kept one step  
removed. I felt smug, until my  
older daughter was old enough  
to start getting teased: “Ah-hah,  
you're not gonna get any  
presents! You’re Jewish!” — you  
know. And, living in a small  
town in Vermont where there  
aren't any Jews hardly, it’s like  
totally unheard of that you  
don't celebrate Christmas. It’s as  

if you're really committing  
sacrilege; the attitude is “It’s not  
just a religious holiday, it’s an  
American holiday, what’s the  
matter with you?” My older  
daughter constantly gets asked,  
“What did you get for  
Christmas?” She’s been pretty  
good about it. But this year I  
think that maybe we'll fly to  
Florida or something; my  
parents have a condominium  
there where there's all Jews, and  
it’s like there’s no such thing as  
Christmas down there.  

ELLEN: Sometimes it really  
seems like one of the major  
things about Christmas is this  
culture trying to do something  
for its children that is so  
overwhelming and wonderful  
and complete that it outdoes all  
the horribleness of the rest of  
the year. Christmas is this time  
when you give children all that  
you can possibly give them and  
if you can’t give your children  
something wonderful for  
Christmas, then you're a  
complete failure as a parent.  

This culture has blown  
Christmas completely out of any  
sense, primarily because  
someone is making money — a  

lot of money — off it. I feel that  
this holiday obviously has such  
deep significance because it’s the  
time of the winter solstice. It’s  
no accident that Christ's  
birthday is celebrated at solstice  
time. It could be this very deep,  
spiritual, meaningful time for  
people — some kind of  
integrated spiritual time. Instead  
the whole thing has gotten  
monstrous.  

I tend to try and spend  
Christmas with my parents.  
They're both getting old and I  
don’t see them that much the  
rest of the year. I feel fine about  
spending Christmas this way; I  
make eggnog and we sit around  
the fire and drink and talk on  
Christmas Eve, then on  
Christmas Day we make a big  
dinner. My father helps a little —  
he has his own specialties.  

Christmas was fun when I was  
a kid, although I’ve been told  
that when I was three-and-a-half  
I went up to my mother and  
told her I knew there was no  
Santa Claus. One thing that was  
very strong for me was the  
church and how wonderful it  
looked at Christmas time — I  
was brought up Catholic. The  
church was full of wreaths and  
there was this wonderful crib  
scene and singing and candles.  

LINDA: I was brought up  
Jewish. When I got older and  
was living with a man who was  
Catholic, we wanted to celebrate  
a hippie Christmas, which meant  
that you didn’t cut down a tree —  
you took a young tree and  
you dug up a root ball and  
brought it in the house — and  
you put cranberries and popcorn  
on it instead of artificial  
decorations. It was all natural.  

I always thought Christian  
people were real stupid about  
Christmas. I couldn’t believe  
they believed in Santa Claus, I  
couldn't believe they thought  
this guy came on a sled with  
reindeer. I was really skeptical of  
all that stuff.  

I grew up in New York, and in  
our neighborhood all the Jews  
lived on one side of the street  
and all the Christians lived on  
the other side. What I remember  
about Christmas is that they all  
got these big presents and I  
couldn't go see them that whole  
day; it was this day you couldn’t  
play with your friends because  

they were celebrating Christmas —  
it was really boring.  

DIAN: You didn’t mind that  
your friends got gifts and you  
didn’t?  

LINDA: No, I think I had  
worked myself up into feeling  
superior about it. I think my  
whole family did this “superior”  
number — about how you're  
Jewish and what the Christian  
people are doing is crass and  
stupid. So we were like really  
aloof from the whole thing.  

One thing I hate about  
Christmas is the way so many  
people feel that they have to go  
back to their families — their  
patriarchal families — for the  
holidays, because their families  
think they should be “home”  
for Christmas. But last year, a  
lot of people I know decided  
they didn’t want to do that, so  
we had a celebration at my  
house. It wasn’t a Christmas  
celebration; it was more like a  
“misplaced soul” celebration.  

AGATHA: Until I was 14,  
Christmas was a big holiday and  
we did all the traditional stuff  
and my mother and  
grandmother would work really  
hard to buy presents and make  
Christmas cookies — it was a big  
thing to see who could make the  
most kinds of Christmas cookies,  
because they would compare the  
cookies to see who made them  
better; I think my mother  
always won. Christmas was fun —  
you'd get presents and eat a  
lot and get to eat cookies for  
breakfast. You'd have to go to  
church, but it was usually okay  
because you got to wear your  
new jewelry or some new  
perfume or a new coat, so all  
during church you'd be sitting  
there gloating and trying to  
remember all the things you'd  
gotten.

Solstice  

December 22 is Winter  
Solstice, the Feast of Lights.  
This year the moon is half full  
on this day. It’s the day the sun  
is farthest south of us and the  
days start getting longer. It is a  
day of bonfires, candles, and the  
burning of the Yule Log, a day  
of feasting with friends. In the  
ancient women’s religion, it is  
the feast celebrating the birth of  
the Goddess Lucina, bringer of  
light. The spirits of the evergreen  
trees are the only ones awake,  
showing us that there is renewal  
of life in the midst of winter.  
This night among the  
matriarchal Celts was Modraniht  
(Mothers’ Night).  

A ritual women have shared is  
for women to gather around a  
fire with candles and evergreens,  
symbolizing the sun goddess  
dispersing the darkness. Women  
chant together and scream the  
birth scream of life reborn with  
Lucina in the death of winter.  
Women jump through the smoke  
of the fire and ask a wish for the  
new year. Feasting and dancing  
follows.  

In our winter world, we need  
a holiday like this one to give us  
courage to face the long cold  
and dark winter. Winter Solstice  
is a holiday many women are  
making their own as an  
alternative to the patriarchal  
religious holidays of Christmas  
and Chanukah.
