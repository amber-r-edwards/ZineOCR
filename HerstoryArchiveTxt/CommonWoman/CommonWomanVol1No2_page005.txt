Bosha Gordon visited the People’s Republic of China this  
spring for two weeks. She traveled with twenty-five people,  
half men, half women, a group composed of ex-servicemen  
who had been stationed in China, their families and friends.  
Her trip covered primarily the east coast of China from Peking  
to Kuangjo (Canton), and then Hong Kong. She focused in this  
time mostly on urban areas. Her glimpses of China were  
necessarily varied and brief. The following are some of my  
thoughts and reactions to hearing Bosha talk of her trip. Some  
time this year Bosha will be presenting a slide show with an  
in-depth report of this journey. Watch for it,

are staffed entirely by women.  
This seemed a contradiction to  
me. Providing daycare as one of  
the major tenets of the western  
women’s movement has meant a  
freeing of women from the  
home so they could do paid  
work, as well as from the role  
and role model of nurturer and  
child rearer.  

Most Chinese families include  
two children. Pills are the major  
means of birth control with  
many women having tubal  
ligations after two children.  
Abortion is both legal and  
acceptable. In fact, one out of  
every three pregnancies is  
terminated by abortion. All  
obstetric and gynecology  
doctors are women.  

I question here why this  
tremendous burden of  
population maintenance seems  
placed so entirely on women,  
and women’s bodies. I wonder if  
these are women’s choices or  
governmental choices. I fear that  
if at some point the Chinese  
government (and it is all men in  
the government, mostly men in  
the militia) decided to increase  
population, these choices  
(abortion, birth control) could  
be removed.  

I fear (and perhaps this is why  
the Chinese women are so  
concerned with a place in  
production, production, not  
just reproduction) that when the  
necessity for production workers  
decreases it will be the women  
whose jobs are eliminated; it will  
be the women who are sent back  
to the home to become child  
rearers, and as unpaid house  
workers, servants. That has been  
the reality in the United States  
(WWII) after the wartime need  
for women workers, and  
therefore daycare centers,  
ended. These are my democratic,  
my Capitalism-bred nightmares.  

Daydreams. Imagine - again...  

-- a nation with no  
commercial competition — no  
one is making a profit off of  
what you buy.

UVM Balks at Sexual  
Harassment Questionnaire  

Sexual harassment at work is  
a serious, widespread problem  
for women. Unfortunately, there  
are few statistics or objective  
information to use for validating  
the extent of the problem and  
developing effective strategies  
for its eradication. As a graduate  
student in experimental  
psychology, I decided to  
investigate this problem.  

I designed a questionnaire  
which was approved by my  
master’s and the human  
experimentation committees. I  
chose to distribute it to women  
employees of the University  
because they make up a large,  
easily accessible group of  
women. My plan was to send the  
questionnaire through the  
campus mail service. The campus  
mail service is available for use in  
“distribution of materials which  
relate to the conduct of business  
at the University,” according to  
the UVM officers handbook. In  
the past, the campus mail service  
has been used for distributing  
questionnaires.  

In order  

to obtain the  

computer printed mailing labels,  

I spoke with Dr. Powers in the  
president's office about my  
project. After reviewing the  
questionnaire with legal and  
labor advisors, he told me that I  
couldn't have the labels.  
Furthermore, he forbade me to  
use the campus mail for  
distribution. His reasoning was  
obscure. He suggested that I do  
the research at another place,  
like IBM or GE.  

Although I should have been  
able to use campus mail, time  
pressures kept me from pursuing  
the issue. Instead, many needless  
hours were spent hand-addressing  
and hand-delivering 1,000  
questionnaires. Respondents  
were provided with a fully  
addressed envelope (no stamp)  
and asked to return the  
completed questionnaire in the  
enclosed envelope. As is their  
right, the women could choose  
to use either the U.S. Post or  
campus mail to return the  
questionnaire. All but three  
chose campus mail. Of the 980  
who received the questionnaire,  
157 returned them, 135 of these  
included a signed consent form.  
(ed. note: this form states that  
participation in completing the  
questionnaire is voluntary and  
that anonymity is guaranteed.)  

Two days following the  
distribution of the  
questionnaire, my department  
chair received a call from the  
Academic Program Support  
office to inform him that 80  
envelopes had been removed  
from the campus mail and were  
being held in that office. In the  
weeks that followed all the  
returned questionnaires were  
held in that office.  

After a week had passed, the  
questionnaires were made  
available to me without  
explanation. Since that time  
each questionnaire had to be  
retrieved from the academic  
program support office (one  
wonders why it is called  
“support”).  

The interception of mail raises  
many issues, least among these  
the right to use a mail service  
with a guarantee that one’s letter  
will arrive intact and without  
delay to the addressee. The  
initial prohibition against the use  
of campus mail raises questions  
regarding adherence to written  
policy as well as guarantees of  
academic freedom. And, of  
course, the entire incident  
represents just one more  
example of patriarchal  
institutions’ suppression of  
women’s power and freedom.  
It’s worth noting that the  
questionnaire is mild. It asks  
women to give their reactions to  
hypothetical situations of sexual  
harassment on the job. It also  
asks if they have ever been  
harassed at work, and whether  
this is a serious problem. If an  
institution is so uptight as to  
make such an illegal and stupid  
move, it must be threatened. Of  
what? The answer seems obvious  
to me. It is two-fold. First:  
exposure. 56% of the women  
said they had experienced sexual  
harassment at work (most  
frequently they discussed  
experiences in past  
employment). Second, whenever  
we make a move to take control  
of our lives we are threatening  
the basic structure of this  
society and thus its institutions.  
This story is not over. I have  
sent a letter requesting answers  
to specific questions as to why,  
how, and on what authority the  
questionnaires were intercepted.  
The reply I received  
acknowledged the illegality of  
the move and suggested I submit  
a proposal for a more explicit  
policy. The proposed policy will  
be written this summer with my  
input and hopefully instituted in  
the fall. I will not let the issue  
rest until I see an explicit policy  
which will prohibit a repeat of  
this experience. When I have  
compiled the results of the  
questionnaire I will make them  
available to any interested  
woman or women’s press.
