COMMONWOMAN JAN/FEB 1979

The night had magic

so my fingers turned

into angel’s wings

flying lightly lightly

over skin so sensitive

that flutters turned to moans

your earthbound breasts

strained to reach my fingers

flying lightly lightly by

but angel’s wings won't

touch the earth

except in passing by.
Margaret MacPhail

SEXUAL MESSAGES

I make love to you
and like a starfish

a fine pointed portion
of my soul

is lopped off

to grow back

stunted

I'm aware

of whispered warnings

messages slipped to me in darkness
years ago

they are hungry

they will snatch at your flesh

they will penetrate your silver dreams
too soon

too soon

in time those voices

settled like dust

in all my secret corners

now I listen hard

to testimonials of lovers
who claim they reach

that hot still center

and fuse

we merge

like clouds bunching in a summer wind
we blend in shadows

like silent fawns

we flow

as jumbling tributaries
streaming

streaming

smug exchanges of surrender

we are practiced lovers

you and I

long past those shapeless gropings
you know your way

like the dancing bee

through my maze

of folds and angles

despite my urgent melting
I still detect the dusty whispers
for me there is no unity
a loss of detail
yes
a filing down of sharp distinction
a crippling uncertainty of self
and now I choose to focus
on that bright hot
pinpoint of pleasure
until it’s sawed off
in jagged rhythms
Carol Cohen

CENTERING

Beat on and on... pulse through me
this sound that is our emerging strength together,
that is our woman essence loosened.
With these beats I connect into the fierceness of our power,
I hold the fullness of our energies—
our sounds, our pains releasing, our loving straining toward communal.
With these beats I writhe and pulse out my primal woman energy
I beat out the traps of patriarchal illusions and images
I beat out my conscious mind and
open open open
to the rushes of woman energy surrounding me

pulsing with me

showing me how beautiful I/WE are
I pulse I bleed I lose my sounds
I celebrate this woman tribe.
Lynn Vera
Michigan Festival
August/1978

How beautiful we are

Standing naked

Gathering the wind inside our bodies
Growing full and strong

With the power of birds in flight.

Then we take in the cracks of lightning
Becoming illumined

And as the rain comes

We are glistening and

Knowing in the magic and wonder of us all...

Nari 8/78
In pages of patterned prose,
How will our meeting be recorded?
As a brief encounter
Passing through one tiny particle of time
In my life?
‘As a time to remember
Leaving a fragment of feeling
Beneath my skin
That was not removed in time
Reminding me
That I should have had it taken care of
THE SUBORDINATION OF MORAL PRINCIPLE Rather than
Let it cause a chronic condition
Always it was the hermit thrush that welcomed us Bordering on love;
to summer and the quiet lake. As we drove Or will it grow
the narrowing road into the shadow With the delicate perfection
of the last hill, his pure fluting washed Of something newborn
the darkened trees before true darkness fell. Crying only when it needs, hurts, or wants,
And smiling more
Bugler, our fathers named him. Because it has been held?
At his call the small birds settled in their nests, Or will it remain fragile
the mourning doves went home, And as hopeless
the younger children shuttled to their beds. As a dandelion
That fears it will be swept
True hermit that he was, we never And blown apart
saw him, yet his note declared Never to be something beautiful again
the end of every day Dropping particles in disarray
until the linemen came — To grow something new in some other place
in the interest of expediency, they said — To become
and sprayed the boughs along the wires Subject again to the wind and the rain
weaving through trees to bring us light. Alone,
They sprayed the underbrush and doused As I wonder
the saplings easing from the woods. If you will leave me
Standing here
Tonight the alders shrivel at its edge. Shivering in the sun.
Overhead the hemlock boughs hang brown. Lynn

Their needles fall
and silence frets the edge of things
Gladys LaFlamme
