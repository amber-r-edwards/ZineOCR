Sonia Johnson is the only  
woman running for president.  
She is running because she  
knows that women have the  
ecological values needed now  
in this dangerous time of super  
powers facing off with nuclear  
weapons while the fate of the  
entire world hangs in the  
balance. She wants to empower  
women and encourage the coun-  
try to take women seriously as

very viable candidates for the  
highest office and as she says: In  
our entire history there’s never  
been a woman president. Is this  
a democracy? She was in Ver-  
mont Saturday the 11th of  
February and met in Montpelier  
with a group of women then  
came to Burlington and spoke  
Saturday night at Trinity to an  

enthusiastic audience of women.  

Johnson is a 47-year-old  
housewife turned heretic who  
made headlines when her pro  
ERA stance led her to be pub-  
licly excommunicated by the  
Mormon church. Her topic was  
women and peace and she spent  
much time describing her trip to  
Central America. El Salvador she  
said was something she had  
barely been able to come to  
terms with; it was like the  
concentration camps and it was  
unbearable knowing one’s coun-  
try was participating in that.  

She realizes that hers will be  
a difficult message to air because  
she is aware that the system is  
designed to keep women out.  
“Men and women have two  
separate cultures and it is the  
male culture that is valued.” We  
have to understand that when  
women are supposedly exalted  
and actually becoming poorer  
and losing rights, that is a  
Patriarchal reversal. The worse  
the position of women really is  
the more inflated the rhetoric  
about our exalted position.  

Before a hearing concerning the use of stray dogs and cats in  
medical experiments, the chairman of the county board of  
supervisors in Phoenix, AZ was quoted as saying, “Why don't  
they bring in homosexuals, and lesbians from San Francisco and  
let's experiment on them?” In attempting to explain the remarks,  
a representative of the county’s Republican party said, “WASP  
American males have a locker room jargon that other males  
recognize... Sometimes our mouths get ahead of our brains and  
we say these kinds of things in public and we don’t mean any-  

thing by them.”

A 79-year-old great-grandmother, Maxine Barry, from Fort  
Lauderdale, FL, rescued another woman who was being attacked,  
saying that she would “‘be more aggressive next time.’ Maxine,  
who stands 5’4", was the only one who tried to help Sylvia  
Feliciano, although others saw the attack. ‘I was on the ground  

VICTORIES  

and he was on top of me,” said Sylvia. “All of a sudden this old  
lady ran up and started hitting him on the back, saying ‘leave  
her alone, leave her alone.’ He ran away fast. If it wasn’t for the  

lady, I might be dead now.”

In Europe the people fear  
the U.S., not the Soviet Union;  
it is the U.S. planting missiles on  
their soil. She was told in  
Holland that Ronald Reagan  
thinks he can fight a limited  
nuclear war and it is over the soil  
of Europe that he is planning to  
fight it.  

Johnson came to feminism  
at the age of 42, the mother of  
five, a devout Mormon and an  
English professor. She describes  
her encounter with the Mormon  
church and her realization of  
women’s role in terms of an  
epiphany conversion. “The  
women’s movement hit me like a  
ten-ton truck. I really saw what  
the place of women was and I  
was furious. The male dictionary  
has no words for the fury and  
sense of betrayal I felt. Every  
woman has in her a file marked  
what it means to be a woman in  
a male world, but most don’t  
think about it because it is too  
painful, but the funny thing is  
when that connection is made,  
all the data is there and organ-  
ized.” Sonia hopes to spur

women to make those connec-  

tions and to take themselves  
seriously enough to run for  
office. What she says is nothing  
less than that the women's  
movement has arisen at the right  
time with the values needed to  
save the world. “It is not that  

women are closer to god or  
made of finer stuff, but that we  
have been entrusted with the  
nurturing and peacemaking; we  
have those skills and they are the  
necessary ones now.”  

She also believes that there  
must be a positive program put  
out; to merely organize against  
Reagan is not enough. Women  
must say what they want, what  
they know. The acting out of  
fear simply gives energy to  
Reagan. On war and peace, “if  
we cannot stop rape in the  
streets of Burlington, how can  
we have peace in the world?”  
There is a 5000-year-old war  
against women and that model  
of one-half the world oppressing  
the other half in the name of  
god is the model for all other  
kinds of oppression.  

Dorchen Leidholdt, a member of New York Women Against  
Pornography, paused momentarily in the Manhattan subway to  

scrawl  

“Degrades Women and Promotes Rape” on a poster  

advertising the August issue of Penthouse magazine. Sighted by a  
Transit Authority policeman, she was arrested, handcuffed, and  
taken to jail, where she received a summons to appear in New  
York Criminal Court on August 22, on trial for ‘writing on  
property.” Dorchen pled not guilty on the basis that Penthouse  
depicts women as sexual objects and targets, and actively pro-  
motes the abuse, rape, and murder of women. “As a woman who  
is dependent on the subway system, I feel that I had no choice  
but to defend myself against Penthouse's dangerous propa-  

ganda...” The judge dismissed the charges.  

A 25-year-old woman filed suit in Wailuku, Hawaii, where  
she was denied unemployment benefits after being fired. The  
state department of labor denied Laura K. Llewellyn benefits on  
the grounds that she had refused to adhere to the policy of the  
company she worked for regarding appearance. Llewellyn was  
fired after she refused a company order to shave under her arms,  
pointing out that shaved armpits were not required of male  
employees. Llewellyn worked for a charter boat firm as a deck-  

hand.

Everywoman’s Place has  
recently hired a part-time coor-  
dinator, Pam Kraynak. She will  
help raise money, and look into  
finding a new location for EWP,  
for the next three months.  
Presently on leave from Ver-  
mont Law School, she will  
return in the fall for the final  
year of her studies (so if, in the  
future, you need the services of  
a lawyer...). Pam has had a lot of  
experience working with organi-  
zations, among them the Ver-  
mont ACLU, where she was  
executive director.  

Also hired part-time by  
EWP is a work-study student,  
Cherie Lyn. She is an off-campus  
Goddard College student, who is  
working on an M.A. in Lesbian/  
Feminist Literature. She will be  
helping Pam, and doing office  
and general tasks (like this  
article).  

Besides looking for a new  
location (EWP is in a temporary  
spot now), EWP is in the process  
of re-evaluating its priorities; and  
deciding a direction and goals  
for the future. In the past the  
women’s center has provided:  

—a space for meetings, sup-  

port and recreation.  

—a center for referral, infor-  

mation, and networking.  

—a feminist library.  
—sponsorship of local and  

visiting literary, musical, and  
political figures.  
—gallery space for local  

women artists.  

—films, lectures, readings,  

receptions...  

Any input concerning these  

and other goals for EWP would  
be appreciated. Now is the time!  

Everywoman’s Place is also  
considering including a business  
in its new location. If anyone  
has ideas about this, or experi-  
ence in running a business,  
please get in touch with us.  

EWP always welcomes sug-  
gestions and ideas, new mem-  
bers, and donations of time  
and/or money! For more infor-  
mation, or to be put on the  
EWP mailing list, call (802)  
658-2422. EWP is open to all  
women!
