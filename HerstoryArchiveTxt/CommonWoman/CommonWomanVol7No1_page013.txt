I’ve loved Judy Grahn’s poetry and this book is no exception: Queen of Wands is  
passionate, witty poetry that  
knits together our heritage when  
god was indeed a woman” and  
reigned supreme, to the veiling  
of her mysteries by the patriarch-  

poem “The land I grew up on is  
rock.” It's difficult to excerpt  
from this poem because of  
its complexity but Grahn says of  
her mother (who is the “rock”  
of the poem) and as Grahn says  

Spider Webster, the creatrix, the  
matrix that Grahn and women  
have known by many names.  
Helen as god is:  

“Flama. Shaker alike of earth  
and of the heavens.  

connections, who acts “truly”  
free and savagely makes war.  
But, of course, it’s not that  
simple because “The Foe” can  
be any kind of:

dedicated to Marilyn Monroe who  
Grahn says “tried, I believe to  
help us see that Beauty has a

read this and find out how much  
of a mind Beauty has for Queen

Queen of Wands is a beautifully,

Book Review  

By Lynn Vera  
The Advocate Guide to Gay  
Health, R. D. Fenwick (second  

Written by a gay man, who loves  
men and respects lesbians, this  
book is supportive, occasionally  

THE personal and playful, and infor-  
mative with a sense of “mission:”  
the author's personal experience.  
I found this chapter the most  
informative and useful for  
that, and I choose to look for  
the ways we can be healthy, and  
empowering, encouraging, and  
grassroots  

GUIDE  

HEALTH  

In general the book contains  
more, and more complete, info  
deals with problems that often  
increase with multiple sexual  
experiences. Openly, supportively  
and clearly he gives detailed  
information aimed at gay men.  
I found some of them —  
like the section on anal sex for  
example, interesting and infor-  
mative even given this fact.  
Others I didn’t — like the gay  
male s/m combined with amyl  
nitrate scene, resulting in an  
amazingly high death rate among  

latent, treatments, how the  
diseases are transmitted, and  
how to prevent getting them.  

The AIDS chapter is also valuable with  
hard to find, down-to-earth  
information.  
The author is not moralistic  
about sex — and that is no small  
investment in breaking through the  
mystique of health and disease,  
and of giving complete, factual  
yet simplified information, is  
obvious.  

I was disturbed with the  
chapter on aging. Seen as a  
problem by gay men (according  
to the author's research, more so  
than by lesbians), it is handled as  
my own fear of seeing that as  
reality for myself, friends,  
mother... but I also believe that  

we need to legally make our  
wishes (about property and  
possessions as well as children)  
clear and tamper proof.  

Oh there were some  
interesting facts about smoking.  
There is evidence that smoking  
inhibits sexual response, as well  
as studies.  
A chapter on Holistic health  

ways. And finally, there are  
extensive reference and resource  
listings, as well as a detailed  
index.  

It’s one volume, 236 pages  

this book deserves attention and  
merit. Health centers, clinics,  
libraries, and bookstores should  
have it — and though you may  
not personally need a copy, it’d  
be a great book to share with a  
few friends and have access to  
easily.  

such in the book. Although some  
sections had really fine information  
for lesbians, especially regarding  
sexually transmitted diseases. (It turns  
out that lesbians have almost  
no chance of getting syphilis or  
gonorrhea if our partners are  
exclusively gay.) This section  
describes symptoms — early and  

the hazards of sex but many of the topics have  
longer sections that refer to  
detailed information aimed at —  
men.  

A section on “sexual dysfunction”  
is encouraging and not at all  
patronizing. Validating the  
many different causes of sexual  
problems and blocks, the author  
poses possible answers through case
