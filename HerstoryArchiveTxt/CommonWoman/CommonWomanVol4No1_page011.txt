feeling angry at women being
bored, leaving, talking during
Michelle's appearance. We, too,
felt angry at women who acted
similarly at our Passover seder —
our attempt to share our history
and culture with many people in
the position to be our oppressors.

no one thought or would think
to give Jewish women money for
anything unless we brought it up
and pushed it ourselves. (Again,
not all Jews in America have
money.) History shows that, for
the most part, it’s only Jews
who help other Jews. Finally,
singling Jews out as an example,
out of ignorance of our history,
does not solve anything. It only
fosters anti-Semitism, which is

threatening to our existence.
We, too, want a solution to

the historical

tensions between Third World
people and Jews — a tension
encouraged and instigated by the
white boys so that we can fight
each other instead of them.
(Historically, Jews have repeatedly
been scapegoated by the ruling class,
so that the oppressed people could
vent their anger on us instead of them — and the trend continues.) We believe that
these tensions can end only if we
both educate ourselves and hear
each other. We appreciate your
work and vulnerability in writing
your article. We hope you
appreciate ours.

Courtship and mating
behaviors may be more widespread than the mixing of genes
by sexual reproduction. “We
report for the first time evidence
indicating that although unisexual
Cnemidophorus lizards have
dispensed with genetic sex,
behavioral sex continues,” says
David Crews of Harvard University.

At least 27 species of
reptiles are made up entirely or
almost entirely of females reproducing parthenogenetically, so
that each daughter is genetically
identical to her mother. Scientists
collected members of three such
lizard species from Arizona and
Colorado and found that pairs of
females of these species (but not
of closely related sexual species)
behave in a manner resembling
mating.

The “sexual” behavior of
the parthenogenetic females
includes courtship and copulation.

Lizards

contained only small, undeveloped
follicles in her ovaries and was
either post-ovulatory or reproductively inactive. The more passive member of the pair
always had large, yolky pre-ovulatory follicles, and laid her
eggs about 30 days later. Crews
and Fitzgerald have seen the
same lizard play both sexual
roles.

The scientists do not yet
know what makes the pre-ovulatory female sexually attractive.
Estrogen administered to females
at other stages of their cycle does
not make them attractive, although
the allure may come from an estrogen-progesterone interaction. Crews suspects that chemicals emitted
by the pre-ovulatory female play
a role, because the lizards have
scent pores along their hind legs
and inspect each other with
much tongue-flicking activity.

The courting behavior seems
to be more than a nonfunctional
vestige of the lizard species’
sexual ancestry. One animal lunges
at another and bites her on
the tail, then mounts the back
and rides atop for a minute or
two, while stroking the back and
neck with her jaws and forelimbs
and rubbing her cloaca (the
female lizard’s combined reproductive and excretory opening)
against the back. The top lizard
grasps the back of the neck or
shoulder in her jaws and curves
her tail beneath the other’s tail
to appose the cloacal regions.
Finally, she shifts her jaw grip
further down the body to
achieve the contorted mating
posture characteristic of that
genus of lizard. The females
maintain the position 1 to 5
minutes, until the bottom
animal breaks away.

Age and size do not deter-
mine the lizards’ sexual role.
Which female is top and which is
bottom is a matter of the
ovulatory cycle, Crews and
Kevin T. Fitzgerald of the
University of Colorado find. In
each of 17 pseudo-matings, the
more aggressive, courting animal
cere

sexual ancestry. Crews says the
behavior primes some hormonal
mechanism that regulates the
ovaries’ activity. Animals caged
alone do reproduce, but they lay
eggs at longer intervals than do
animals raised in groups.

So far the scientists have no
idea of the ecological significance
of the sexual behavior. The lizards
live in large groups in burrows
and are fast-moving. “In the wild,
we never saw anything other than
biting and chasing. We don’t know
what's going on in those tunnels,” Crews says.

In current work, Crews and
collaborators are treating the
eggs of parthenogenetic lizards
with hormones to try to create
males. Crews says that they
have already had some success
in that the gonads of hatchlings
of some treated eggs have a
male-like duct system. “This
could be the most dramatic
research,” Crews says. In essence
they may be turning their lizards
from parthenogenesis back to
two-sex reproduction.
