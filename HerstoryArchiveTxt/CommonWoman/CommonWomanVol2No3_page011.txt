this country, the war against the
Native American people. Geno-
cide of the Native people has
always been and still is the
intent of the U.S. government.
Ninety million Native Americans
were living in North and South
America when the Europeans
arrived. By the time the U.S.
government was created, over
three-fourths of them were dead,
either directly from war or from
disease brought by the Euro-
peans. Today there are only one
million Native people left and
the U.S. government continues its
programs of planned destruc-
tion.

Up to 50% of the land base
of many reservations is occupied
by U.S. military. $2,500 is the
average annual income for Na-
tive American families living on
reservations. Unemployment on
the reservations runs between 50
and 85%, and runs 35-45% in the
cities. On some reservations the
suicide rate is ten times higher
than the national average. Be-
tween 25 and 30% of all Native
Womyn have been sterilized;
25-35% of all Indian children are
stolen from their parents and
placed in white foster homes
(assimilated). Another 25% are
sent to Bureau of Indian Affairs

boarding schools to whitewash
Native children and destroy
Native culture.

Do you see?... This list of
horrors is directly related to
Yvonne Wanrow. If she had been
a white woman, and he a Native
American man, I have little
doubt that her action would
have been recognized as self-
defense, and probably there
would be no trial. The U.S.
government wants Yvonne Wan-
row behind bars because she is a
Native American Woman, a
freedom fighter, fighting for the
future of a people the govern-
ment is trying to destroy.

But no, it is not even as
“simple” as that. Yvonne Wan-
row is a Woman, and here the
ramifications of what is happen-
ing to her take on another very
serious dimension. Earlier I
wrote that had she been white
the charges would have been
dropped long ago — I think I
need to question and rethink
that. We cannot forget that the
government, and its court sys-
tem, is shaped by, patterned
after, and controlled by the

white, male, historically patriar-
chal forces of the country. The
forceful refusal to submit as
victim, to endure the male
attack on herself and her child-
ren, is the refusal to submit not
only to the dominant culture,
meaning white, but also meaning
male.

Is there a message for all
womyn in the courts’ prosecu-
tion of Yvonne Wanrow? Is her
initial 25-year sentence meant,
even in some unconscious way,
as a deterrent to other womyn’s
refusal to submit, to endure
being victimized? Is the insinua-
tion that it is not only “more
Indian” but also “more woman-
ly” (racist, misogynist) to en-
dure the attack on oneself and
one’s children?

NO MORE... We have got to
fight back, and in large numbers.
It is essential that we womyn,
feminist womyn (and men with
feminist consciousness) do not
ignore what is happening to
Yvonne Wanrow. Womyn are
attacked every minute in this
country... We HAVE to REact
powerfully. We can no longer
endure this dual intimidation,
first by the attacker and then by
the courts.

Yvonne Wanrow, Native,
Woman, is being persecuted for
daring to not be raped, beaten,
killed, and for protecting her
children from the same. It is so
outrageous. Think about it.
Allow it to get you angry, afraid.
It is horrible, and incredibly
scary to what lengths the govern-
ment is willing to go. As a
Woman, an ethnic minority, and
a political Lesbian, I am fright-
ened by the fascist-like controls
in this country, and affected
daily by the male power and
values here. But wherever it is in
my power I will fight being a
victim. And when one of my
sisters is caught and persecuted
(by one attacker or another) I
will try to know of her struggle
as my own.

Yvonne Wanrow is in pri-
son, and she is on trial. I don’t
really know how to get her out,
how to get charges dropped,
how to make people see what is
going on. Yvonne urges a letter-
writing campaign to stop this
second trial, and to demand that
charges against her be dropped

FEATURING CLASSIC ANARCHIST
AND SOCIALIST BOOKS AND FEMINIST

SURVEY RESULTS

As promised, here are the
long and eagerly awaited results
of our survey. We wish to thank
those who took the time as well
as those who have talked to us in
person about the paper. We are
always happy to hear from you
and we love to get letters (hint,
hint).

The response to our survey
was, to coin a phrase, under-
whelming. We heard from 11
women and one none-of-your-
business. They were evenly dis-
tributed in age from 20 to 53,
which makes us happy to be
reaching what looks like a fairly
wide spectrum of women. All
consider themselves to be femi-
nist; Most were subscribers who
had originally heard about us
from a friend. All regularly read
several feminist publications —
the ones mentioned most often
were Off Our Backs, Ms. and
Lesbian Connection.

It seems everyone likes us.
We didn’t hear (in writing) from
anyone who didn’t, and none of
the criticism we received was
very severe. However, while all
would send us to their friends,
only three would send us to
their mothers.

The thing mentioned most
often as a reason for liking us
was the variety of articles and
viewpoints we present. Also, the
very idea of having a newspaper
by, for, and about women was
exciting to many women. Most
thought we were just right or
“good for a young paper.”
Practically everything we've ever
printed got at least one mention
as a favorite article, including
“weird and crazy articles in
Pandora’s Box” and “the more
positive ones about women who

are doing things — their own
thing — well.”

The overwhelming vote for
topics people would like to see
went to politics of all kinds:
local, state, national and inter-
national. Other topics people
would like to see included just
about everything we've already
covered; also: a consumers’ page,
sports, spirituality, short stories,
an anonymous column to
encourage controversy and “any
subject frowned upon by the
establishment.” One woman
said, “I would like to read an
article about how a woman can
find an interesting, well-paying
job from 12 to 2:30 p.m. for
mothers who have children in
kindergarten.”

Several persons complained
that papers are late and get
mangled in the mail. This was
also mentioned in connection
with the plain, brown wrapper
question (which, by the way,
was meant to be humorous). We
have complained to the post
office about this and suggest
that anyone who has been
having trouble should file an
official complaint with the post
office.

Other complaints were “ar-
ticles are sometimes a bit too
wordy and unfocused and/or
academic; needs humor;” “I
sometimes wonder whether you
print articles deliberately to
shock readers — OK, but a little
goes a long way. There are many
of us out here who don’t per-
ceive the movement as a violent
revolution; “I don't care to see
articles by or about people who
don't think feminism is impor-
tant. I can read that anywhere
and it wastes our time and
energy; “too much hostility for
men.” Other no votes went to
poetry, ads and cartoons.

On the looks of the paper,
our readers mostly said fine, OK,
good or words to that effect.
“Headlines could be more ima-
ginative;” “spruce up your car-
toon. Change layout;” and
“would like to see ads take up
less space on page.” Other
comments on our ads were “Well
done — probably too inexpen-
sive for your needs;” “sell what
you can to make $ to help keep
it going;” “wish some home-
made stuff was more adver-
tised;” and “too many. I don't
like to be reminded of all the
capitalist trips out there.”

Suggestions for improve-
ment included more follow-
through on articles needed,
references at the ends of articles
and that we should compile a list
of references and referral phone
numbers. We are going to try
and do this. We also want to try
the suggestion that mentioning
need for articles on specific
topics might help us widen our
sources for copy. “Women need
to know how to succeed so
articles about women who have
experience in success would be
good. Also non-success stories so
we could learn what not to do.”

We would like to thank
everyone for their suggestions
and always welcome further
dialogue. One final suggestion
was that we and our readers
should leave our old copies in
laundromats and waiting rooms
and pass them around. Spread
the word. Thank you.
