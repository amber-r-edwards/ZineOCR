Sup leaving a hole the size of a  
pencil point for urination and  
menstruation. When the woman  
has sexual intercourse, the  
wound must be broken open,  
and labor requires the equivalent  
of a double episiotomy. All this  
is done with at most a local  
anesthetic if done in a hospital.  
In many countries where it is  
not done in a hospital, spice  
powder is thrown into the  
child’s face to keep her con-  
scious throughout the ordeal.  
Women of all classes, including  
the university-educated, are  
affected. Some have denounced  
the practice. The main reason  
given for these operations is to  
prevent women from enjoying  
sex and sleeping around. The UN

Mutilation  

African groups defend the prac-  
tice as embedded in African  
culture and society (cultural  
relativism) and denounce attacks  
on it as racist and Western  
imperialist. Lisa Volkov pointed  
out that clitoridectomy was  
practiced in the United States  
from the 19th century into the  
1940s. (Remember Freud — the  
“immature” clitoral orgasm vs.  
the “mature” vaginal one.)  
Female genital mutilation is  
called “female circumcision”  
where it’s practiced, making it  
semantically equivalent to male  
circumcision, thus minimizing its  
trauma. While in some countries  
like Egypt it’s illegal, the laws  
prohibiting it are not enforced.  

The demonstration got on  
AP and UPI, which, according to  

Diane Conklin, wrote “fairly  
accurate” stories, but none of  
the major East Coast newspapers  
covered it. There was coverage in  
Voice of America, Danish Radio  
and Canadian Broadcasting.  
Conklin is now negotiating with  
the two Washington, DC news-  
papers for articles.

genital mutilation, the organizers

who usually don’t get validation.  
We do not want this process  
perpetuated.  

The concept of wanting  
recognition for generosity is  
related to the Judeo-Christian  
idea of charity. When it is  
charity, you set up those above  
and those below.  

When an oppressed person

has legitimate anger at someone  
else's privilege, that anger needs  
to be validated. There needs to  
be a separation made between  
the anger oppressed people feel  
about their oppression and their  
personal dislikes.  

We recognize that people  
who give up anything, even if it  
is something they have an  
abundance of, need to go  
through a difficult personal  
process. Middle and upper class  
women need to realize that their  
oppressiveness comes through  
values and attitudes that can be  
shed so that it doesn’t leave  
them in a place of self-hate and  
guilt. We write this article in the  
spirit of women who want to see  
the continuation of this process  
be a way to strengthen us as a  
community.

Anger hot and dry.  

The desert is hot anger.  
I am dry with anger.  
Futility of day to day life.  

The need of milk and bread and all the extras.  

The energy wasted on extras.  
The life energy of coping.  
Why must it be coping.  

The directions we take,  

The dreams we break,  

Shackling each other into ordinariness.  

I am ordinary.  
I am angry.  
I have always needed more.  

Now I need less and less and less and less.  

My day has blanks.  

Did I believe those fibs of happiness and love?  
Am I in it or is this the way it works?  

Do I struggle?  

Or am I strangled with the lies I tell myself?  

Are they lies?  
I feel gripless.  

Did I ever feel a grip on truth?  

Weightless... drift like snow.  

My mind never repeats a pattern.  

It’s been one year since I have written.  

My hand is slower, less defiant.  

I am coping now.  

The ink is strong, the words are not.  
“my red runny wound, the rawness scraped by bone”  

Repeats of life.  

Husband equals motherfatherbrother fights.  

I need the green gold gleam of forests, cabin  
candlesticks on the mantle and action born in the heart.

bility — they get to explore their  
own strengths and share their  
experiences. We have received  
some grants, but none of us  
receive any money for the work  
we do. Maybe this will be  
different one day. We, the  
group, have the power to make  
all decisions about our work and  
for this we are proud; i.e. we are  
not applying for government  
grants that will give us all sorts  
of requirements and strings in  
exchange for their money.  

Right now the group con-  
sists of between five and seven  
women. We are getting tired and  
overloaded. We desperately need  
input from the community on  
where to go from here.  

Does this community want  
this resource to continue?  

Do we as a community, and  
us individually, have the energy  
and time to make a project like  
this happen? Do we have money  
resources or energy to search out  
and apply for grants or do local  
fundraising? Are there people  
out there who want to help us?  
We need women with energy  
for writing literature, training  
volunteers, community educa-  
tion and outreach, doing speak-  
ing engagements, being on call  
for fundraising, for child care,  
for doing maintenance on our  
house...  

There will be an EMER-  
GENCY MEETING to discuss  
these issues on Sunday, January  
20, at noon. For place and more  
information, call us at 863-9117.  
We need to hear from people.  
We are tired. We need input,  
suggestions, fantasies, and ener-  

gy.
