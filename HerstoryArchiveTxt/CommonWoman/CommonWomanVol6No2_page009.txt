COMMONWOMAN  

—Michel Foucault  

One's most profound response is  

_ politicized by the _ silent  

response of domination of he  

who identifies with the sexual con-  

fession, he who categorizes  
and classifies it.  

—Robert V. R. Allan  

All speech is on the side of the  
Law.  
—Roland Barthes  

An individual, in this culture, is someone who is never alone or silent.  

—Sylvere Lotringer  

One who disturbs legality in  
speech asks us to believe lan-  
guage is not reducible to com-  
munication. One who subverts  
must undermine voice, delivery,  
word speed and rhythm to the  
point of another intelligibility.  

—Roland Barthes  

Technology is the  
only nature we have left,  
—Sylvere Lotringer  

The only sexuality is male.  
—Baudrillard  

Language is always a matter  
of force. To speak is to exercise  
will for power.  

—Roland Barthes  

Constant obligation to com-  
municate.  
—Sylvere Lotringer  

Or not speak at all; which,  
would be to rejoin other roles —  
the great silent mind, mute with  
the weight of experience, or the  
militant who in the name of  
praxis dismisses all discourse as  
futile.  

—Roland Barthes  

To return to feminine psy-  
chology, I submit that the role  
attributed to infantile sexuality  
in general and to penis envy in  
particular as genotypic influ-  
ences influencing what are  
regarded as the modal personal-  
ity characteristics of adult  
women cannot be proved on  
biologic and other empirical  
grounds, no matter how widely  
and repetitiously they are given  
the status of unassailable truths  
in large segments of educated  
opinion in the United States.  

—Paul Chodoff  

Why not add up singularities  
instead of opposing differences?  
—Sylvere Lotringer  

Even before slavery or class  
domination existed, men built  
an approach to women that  
would serve one day to intro-  
duce difference among us all.  

—Claude Lévi-Strauss  

Silences That Stammer  

Silences That Stutter  

The real strength of the  
women’s liberation movement is  
not that of having laid claim to  
the specificity of their sexuality  
and the rights pertaining to it,  
but that they have actually  
departed from the discourse  
conducted within the appara-  
tuses of sexuality.  
—Michel Foucault  

The path to that place is the  
discourse sought  
—Robert V. R. Allan  

..a veritable movement of  
de-sexualization, a displacement  
effected in relation to the sexual  
centering of the problem, for-  
mulating the demand for forms  
of culture, discourse, language  
and so on, which are no longer  
part of that rigid assignation and  
pinning-down to their sex which  
they had initially been political-  
ly obliged to accept...  

—Michel Foucault  

In these times you should  
not expect any words of my  
own from me — none but these  
words which barely manage to  
prevent silence from being mis-  
interpreted.  

—Karl Kraus  

I am a foreigner to myself in  
my own language and I translate  
myself by quoting all the others.  
—Madeleine Gagnon  

..the silences where the  
lives never came to writing,  
Among these, the mute inglori-  
ous Miltons: those whose waking  
hours are all struggle for exis-  
tence; the barely educated; the  
illiterate; women. Their silence  
the silence of centuries as to  
how life was, is, for most of  
humanity, Traces of their mak-  
ing in folk song, lullaby, tales,  
language itself, jokes, maxims,  
superstitions — but we know  
nothing of the creators or how it  
was with them.  

—Tillie Olsen  

The entire history of  
women's struggle for self-deter-  
mination has been muffled in  
silence over and over.  

—Adrienne Rich  

We are silent and even our  
voices drowned out by other words. Or —  
Suppose that if one finally spoke  
a silence: can it be heard.  

..the differing past of  
women — that should be part of  
every human consciousness, cer-  
tainly every woman's conscious-  

ness... Excluded, excluded, ex-  
cluded from council, ritual,  
activity, learning, language,  

when there was neither biologi-  
cal nor economic reason to be  
excluded,  

—Tillie Olsen  

Feminism (as if it needs to  
be said) owes its existence to  
universality of misogyny, gyno-  
phobia, androcentrism, and  
hetero-sexism. Feminism exists  
because women are everywhere  
oppressed at every level of  
exchange from the simplest  
social intercourse to the most  
elaborate discourse.  
—Eds. New French Feminisms  

“Political” poetry by men  
remains stranded amid the strug-  
gles for power among male  
groups; in condemning U.S.  
imperialism or the Chilean junta  
the poet can claim to speak for  
the oppressed while remaining,  
as male, part of a system of  
sexual oppression. The enemy is  
always outside the self, the  
struggle somewhere else.  

—Adrienne Rich  

Men must learn to be silent.  

One scarcely experiences an  
event before men speak out —  
start to speak, speak alone and  
for everyone else, on behalf of  
everyone else as they put it.  
Women and extremists are  
forced into silence,  

—Marguerite Duras  

Shut up, you're only a girl.  

Suppose that every gesture  
one made — every word, every  
act, signal, motion, a smile, a  
frown, a wave of a hand, a  
shout, a scream, a kick, a rush of  
words — each and every expres-  
sion of one’s psyche were  
ignored. Suppose that in a  
company of people, every time  
one opened one’s mouth to  
speak, one’s own words were  
met with a waiting silence, one  
encountered no response, no  
dialogue but instead simply a  
stillness, as if nothing had ever  
been said. Along with defama-  
tion of being, this is the single  
most common experience that a  
woman has of her own real  
presence in the pornographic  
culture.  

—Susan Griffin  

..every unfulfilled inner  
duty becomes a misfortune that  
never leaves,  
—Franz Kafka  

..the loneliness of all life-  
expanding impulses in a society  
created out of the triumph of  
force and will.  

—Adrienne Rich  

Calling forth such powers  
which are then not permitted to  
function.  

—Franz Kafka  

Our language will first be  
stuttering.  
—Catherine Clément  

Feminist practice can only  
be negative — something not  
said, something....above  
beyond nomenclatures and ideo-  
logies... Certain men are familiar  
with this phenomenon.  

—Julia Kristeva  

Woman is the untruth of  
truth.  

—F. Nietzsche  

Feminism needs to  
renounce belief in own identity  
to avoid co-optation by power  
or spirituality.  

—Julia Kristeva  

It is everything we don’t  
know we can be that is written  
out of me.  

—Hélène Cixous  

She has not allowed herself  
to be won — she cannot be won  
because she is the nonperson  
who yet is (her own) writing.  

—Claudia Crawtord  

Behind women, there is  
darkness. Behind men, there are  
lies.  

—Marguerite Duras  

The element of song — a  
woman is never far from  
“mother.” She writes in white  
ink. Working the in-between,  
inspecting the process of same  
and of the other without which  
nothing can live, undoing the  
work of death.  

—Hélène Cixous  

They say that they sing with  
such utter fury that the move-  
ment that carries them forward  
is irresistible.  

—Monique Wittig  

For at least a century the  
literary avant-garde has been  
introducing ruptures, blank  
spaces and holes into language  
(Joyce, Artaud, Mallarmé).  
These are signs of force not  
grasped by the linguistic or  
ideological system. The fragmen-  
tation of language confronts the  
phallic position either to traverse  
or deny it. This traversal implies  
that the subject experiences  
sexual difference, not as fixed  
opposition (man/woman) but as  
a process of differentiation.  

—Julia Kristeva  

I have been standing all my life in the  
direct path of a battery of signals  
the most accurately transmitted most  
untranslatable language in the universe  

—Adrienne Rich  

a wooden ladle  
twists in our mouths for the alphabet  
but the tongue is no soup bone  
the teeth give no broth  

—Olga Broumas  

The frightful prison of love  
will finally be forced open when  
all those who know how to talk  
of love, how to want it and live  
it, will join together and merge  
lovingly, bursting with the laugh-  
ter and the pleasure of being  
both men and women, and yet  
neither; of being both young and  
old, and yet neither, and yet all  
else as well. That prison will give  
way when, branding every place  
and every text with their subver-  
sive love, they cause the down-  
fall, the first death rattle of the  
haters, the vampires, the zom-  
bies, atrocious puppets of our  
history. Only then will we know  
what pleasure, knowledge, acti-  
vity, language, really mean.
