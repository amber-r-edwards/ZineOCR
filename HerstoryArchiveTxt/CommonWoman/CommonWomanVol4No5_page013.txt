Every moment counts now

Blue lights  
Rising moon  
Pink and indigo sky  

Speak to us  
oh ancientness of the rocks  
She bears the pain of ages  
centuries past  

When we were slaves  
bound concubine  
wrapped  
encapsulated  
entrenched  
ensconced  
enmeshed  
entrophying  
dying our deaths  

We live our lives  
no more fighting  
We live our lives  
in beauty now  
There is no time for anything else  

The water laps against rocks  
And I kiss your lips  
a way I've never kissed before  
endless touching  
lovemaking  

The crystal lies against her  
woven blanket  
of Indian design  
diamonds  
XX patterns  
Ischel goddess womoon  
womoon of colors  
pray for us  
let us see our colors  

The moon rises, opens, falls  

Flowers of a moment  
so amazing  
a-mazing  
de-maze  
de-mystify  

We are flowers  
the key  
de-mystify  
opening flowers  

unfold  
enfold  
envelope  
encircle  
enlighten,  

Endless  
waves of  
opening  
coming in motion  
in time  
in rhythm  
calling over mountains  

River womoon  
calling  
to herself  
her womoon self  
to be free  

Ocean womoon flying over waters  
it's time to be free  

POETRY  

Mountain womoon  
calling to herself  
her home  
to come to her home and be free  

And the waters of the river  
gently curl around  
your fingers  
your breasts  
sunlight  
renewing your caress  
softening to madness  
fierceness  
touching such loving  

And the rock embraces her body  
soothing breathing  
supporting such life  
ancient messages repeating  

I play with your lips  
against mine  
a circle of light ensconces the moon  
creative energy  

Pay attention to the open spaces  
the openings  
seeing freely  
the positives  
breathing deeply  
blue lights  
indigo tones  
our skin  
our bones  
our bones withered  
with age  
withered  
with rage  

Come out  

be yourself  

let go  
no more rage  

let go  

no more to be attached to  

let go  
and let the dance begin

PHOTOGRAPHS.  
(for Peggy)  

I see you  
Burning, burning through day and night,  
Slowly deciding to bear a child  
So Terry would not go  
To Vietnam.  
You thought the war was “over there”  
In the urban ghetto,  
In the Vietnam jungles and villages.  
Not here, not in your body or mind.  
Our bodies hungering, raped;  
Our spirits left untended:  
The acid of family indifference  
To our unpaid labor  
Burns dutiful daughters, mothers, wives to  
Oblivion.  
The mind withers, unknown;  
The soul faints, unloved;  
The body dies of slow poison.  
I see you slowly gathering,  
Sifting the evidence,  
Finding your body  
Beneath the rubble of centuries  
Evidence weighed:  
Your passion burns clear,  
Refusing compromise or marriage,  
Building your own life,  
Making your own path.
