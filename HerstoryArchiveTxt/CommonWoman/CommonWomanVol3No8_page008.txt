EATUIRIES IE AITUIRIES

By Dian Kendrick Mueller

(This article is one in a
series on women in both tradi-
tional and untraditional jobs.
The three women interviewed in
this article are all members of
Shelter Builders, an all-woman
collective. This is an edited
transcript of our conversation.)

DIAN KENDRICK
MUELLER: Do all of you
intend to make your living with
carpentry?

KATEY WOLFF: Yes. I just
got a job this week, doing finish
carpentry, finishing off a store in
the Mall in Burlington. It’s
interesting work, but the
environment could be better. It’s
very commercial, it’s Burlington
Square, I don’t like Burlington
Square, politically it makes me
angry that so much money's
being spent creating this super-
fancy shopping center when

there isn’t even a safe home for

battered women in Burlington.

I have all of these political
feelings about what kind of
work I'd like to be doing, and
this job doesn't feel integrated
with my personal politics. But in
terms of doing carpentry, it’s a
challenging job, it’s finish work,
which I like to do, and it’s
indoors and it’s warm.

DIAN: Does it pay well?

KATEY: No. It pays $5 an
hour, which is what laborers are
getting paid.

DIAN: And you're a skilled
craftsperson.

KATEY: Yes, I consider
myself a skilled finish carpenter.

DIAN: Do you think that
men who have your skills are
getting paid better?

KATEY: Yes.

DIAN: What are you doing
now, Joyce?

JOYCE CHENEY: I don’t
have work right now. I’m
wanting to work for somebody
else, because I’ve done it before,
and I'm at a different skill level
than Katey, I’ve got a lot more
that I need to learn.

I've worked with boys
before and it’s a really horrible
environment. Usually the way
commercial construction crews
do it is they have one woman, if
they have any women. This one
woman is constantly being
watched and if she does some-
thing right, then that’s a source
of comment, and if she does
something wrong, that’s a source
of comment, too. It's a really
tense environment. I worked in a
situation once with boys where
I was given a chance to try some
new things and if it had been the
same work assignment with
women it could have been really
exciting, but it was just a very
pressured situation and I had a
really hard time maintaining any
sense that I had anything to
offer, because I was constantly
comparing myself to them and
they were, too.

DIAN: So you want to learn
more, but you're worried about
finding the right environment,
and that's very difficult?

JOYCE: Yes. It’s hard

THREE CARPENTERS

enough just to find a job.

DIAN: How about you,
Debbie? Are you doing any
carpentry right now?

DEBBIE VENN: I'm just
doing some small, independent
jobs right now. And for the past
month I’ve been doing some
work at the Women’s Health
Center, small carpentry stuff.

I’m thinking about trying to
find another full-time job. I was
working over the summer at
Forest Hills in Winooski; they’ve
gutted the building and they’re
building 150 luxury apartments.
I’ve gone back over there to see
what's available, but none of
them are really carpentry jobs.
There’s sheet rocking jobs,
there’s putting up metal studs,
stuff like that, not carpentry.

DIAN: How long have you
been a carpenter?

DEBBIE: I feel like I've
done carpentry since I moved to
the Burlington area three years
ago, just on an independent
basis, just getting jobs from
friends and working for contrac-
tors.

DIAN: What skill level do
you think of yourself as being?

DEBBIE: I'm not a finish
carpenter. I’ve done finish car-
pentry, but I’ve done a lot more
framing and that kind of work
than I’ve done finish stuff.

DIAN: Do you have the
same problems Joyce has in
trying to figure out how you'll
learn more?

DEBBIE: I haven't really
gone after that. I’ve been able to
support myself just on small
jobs. But I’ve found, starting last
winter, that that feels like it’s

drying up. I don’t think I can

make it anymore just doing
small jobs, so I’m going to try
and get hired again full-time by a
regular construction company,
even though it’s hard to go and
work with men eight hours a
day, five days a week. It feels to
me like a lot of stress. But
I haven't encountered that many
jobs where I can work with
women.

DIAN: So, ideally, would
you all like to do carpentry with
and for women? And if you
want to learn more skills, learn
them with women?

KATEY, JOYCE and
DEBBIE: Yes.
DIAN: But what you're

finding is that it’s just not
possible to support yourself on
just that kind of job? A job
where you feel comfortable
with the politics, and you feel
comfortable with the support
you're getting. It’s very hard to
find a job like that.

KATEY: It’s hard to find it
or create it. When we talked
about forming Shelter Builders,
we talked about trying to form a
group that could do larger jobs.
We talked about building houses,
building a house together. But
what constantly happens is
you’re competing with men in
the job market, and — because
you’re women — you get paid
less. If we're working as an
all-women crew, we can expect
to have to pay ourselves less in
order to put in a lower bid. I
think, in order to get a job we'd
have to put in a significantly
lower bid than any group of
men, regardless of how qualified
we are, simply because people
don’t take women construction
workers seriously.

JOYCE: There are feminists
in this town who aren’t using
Shelter Builders because they’d
rather hire men, without check-
ing out what skills we have.

DIAN: But isn’t that just in
the beginning? Say you did get
something like Shelter Builders
started, or you got your own
individual business going, in the
beginning you might have to
underbid and underpay your-
selves. But if you establish a
reputation with people, if they
think your work is good,
wouldn't you think that in the
future you'd be able to pay
yourself more?

JOYCE: Well, yes. Part of
it’s just the problem of any small
business starting, where a lot of
your business comes from the
girls. You just start small and it
takes a long time.

DIAN: When was it that
you started working on Shelter
Builders?

JOYCE: We started talking
about it theoretically last winter,
when there wasn’t much con-
struction work anyway. In Ver-
mont, construction slows down
in winter.

DIAN: So that was you and
some other women? Shelter
Builders is a group of women
who have carpentry skills and
who are interested in working in
a collective?

DEBBIE: My conception of
it in the beginning was just using
each other as resources in terms
of tool sharing, in terms of job
referrals, looking for people to
hire, and stuff like that.

DIAN: Not going in as a
company, you mean? Not being
a company that builds a house,
for instance.

JOYCE: Well, we talked

about doing that in the begin-
ning. We just haven’t put in the
kind of time for that to happen
— people have had to go in
different directions to make a
living.

KATEY: We're trying to do
a business venture and a collec-
tive and working with each other
differently than the way the
boys create businesses out there,
and I think that’s an important
part of Shelter Builders.

DEBBIE: It's difficult, but
there’s also rewards. I think that
all the women in Shelter Build-
ers acknowledge the rewards, the
support of working in an all-
woman environment.

DIAN: You want Shelter
Builders to be two things — you
want it to be commercial, you
want to make money so that
you can live, but at the same
time you don’t want to do
things the way traditional capita-
list companies do. Is that right?

JOYCE: I could tell you my
fantasies. My fantasy is I'd like
to have a situation where there’s
enough work to support women
of a variety of skill levels.

KATEY: My fantasy is
building houses, small homes—
DEBBIE: Yes, small,

energy-efficient homes.

KATEY: Small general con-
tracting, you know, which
would be where we would design
the homes we were building, we
wouldn’t do all of the work, but
we'd be subcontracting, we'd be
hiring subcontractors to put in
the insulation, and electricians,
and plumbers, and so on, and
we'd oversee the whole job. We
would do the carpentry aspects

of the job.
JOYCE: I'd like to say one
thing. I feel like right now

there’s a lot of paying attention
to and examination about who
within the dyke community has
power and status and for what
reasons, who gets points for
what. I think that in lots of dyke
communities carpentry is an in
dyke skill and it’s because it’s a
male skill. I think that we
perpetuate the same scene as we

came through with the boys.
You know — it’s groovier to be
a carpenter than to be a cook. I
don’t know what I want to say
about that; I just wanted to say
that I think that phenomenon is
happening. Giving more points
for “male” skills is perpetuating
the mystique that the boys want
us to perpetuate.
