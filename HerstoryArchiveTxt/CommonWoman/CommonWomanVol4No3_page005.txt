Optional Castration  

Oklahoma City — Under a  
bill passed overwhelmingly by  
the Oklahoma House recently,  
convicted rapists and other sex  
offenders would have the option  
of undergoing castration in  
hopes of receiving reduced sen-  
tences. The measure was passed  
by a 65-25 vote and now goes on  
to the Senate. The experience of  
European countries where cas-  
tration of sex offenders is  
allowed indicates the surgery is  
the only thing that works in  
curbing sex crimes. In countries  
where castration of sex offen-  

ders is permitted, those convicted  
are charged with a sex offense  
again. This compares with a  
recidivism rate of 50 to 75% for  
rapists in this country.

Crucial Cases  

NOW National Times  
Some crucial cases of interest to  
feminists will be heard by the  
Supreme Court in the next six  
months — watch for decisions  
in:  

—Rostker v. Goldberg, to  
decide the constitutionality of  
the males-only draft registration;  

—a case challenging the  
Louisiana law allowing a hus-  
band to mortgage jointly owned  
property without his wife's  
consent (the nefarious “head  
& master” law);  

—the question of whether  
military retirement pay can be  
divided between spouses as part  
of a settlement in divorce cases  
(a crucial question, since such  
pay is often the major portion of  
a couple’s assets).  

Anti-Semitism  

Hamburg, West Germany —  
According to a recent public  
opinion poll in West Germany,  
anti-Semitism is still alarmingly  
strong there. This particular poll  
showed that half of the West  
Germans surveyed were preju-  
diced to varying degrees against  
Jews. Of those surveyed, one-  
third had pronounced anti-  
Semitic prejudices. Another  
recent government survey re-  
ported 18% of West German  
voters believe Germany was  
better off under Hitler than it is  
today.  

Court Victory  

National NOW Times — A  
U.S. District Court has ruled  
that it is “unlawful sex discri-  
mination for an employer to  
require women to wear ‘sexually  
revealing attire’ as a condition of  
employment.” The federal judge  
found this requirement to be a  
violation of Title VII of the Civil  
Rights Act. The woman plaintiff  
was awarded back pay.

Temple Nonsexist  

National NOW Times —  
Temple Beth El in Sudbury,  
Mass. has revised its prayer book  
to nonsexist language. The Tem-  
ple has increased the emphasis  
given to the matriarchs — Sarah,  
Rebeccah, Leah, and Rachel —  
and replaced such terms as “O  
our Mother and Father.” The  
congregation intends to restore  
the dignity of women in their  
prayers.  

Funds for Abused Wives  

Free Press Editorial — Only  
by providing money from the  
general fund can the state  
guarantee that the needs of  
battered women will be met  
consistently. The House bill to  
increase marriage fees by $10 to  
cover the cost of programs for  
battered women is designed to  
raise up to $60,000 a year to  
cover the cost of services for  
abused wives, but would that  
amount be adequate to meet  
these needs? If the revenues fell  
short of needs, many agencies  
might be unable to provide the  
services so sorely needed by  
battered women and many  
would be denied help.  

Abenaki Indians  

Free Press — The Abenaki  
Indian Nation is making pro-  
gress, but continued intra-tribal  
discord, the potentially volatile  
issue of land claims and an  
unresolved court case still plague  
them. St. Francis-Sokoki mem-  
bers dominate the Abenaki Tri-  
bal Council and the confedera-  
tion of three dissident bands, the  
Missisquoi, Green Mountain and  
Eastern Woodlands. There is  
much intra-tribal struggle, but it  
is among the leaders, not the  
people, and is not helping their  
cause. The court case involves  
about 30 Abenakis who were  
charged with fishing without a  
license almost two years ago.  
They have pleaded innocent on  
the grounds of aboriginal rights.  
Prosecutors have said that the  
Abenakis must first prove they  
are Indians before the case can  
be taken further.  

Hospice Leader Honored  

New York — British physi-  
cian Cicely M. Saunders, a leader  
in the hospice movement to help  
people die confidently rather  
than in fear, was recently named  
winner of the 1981 Templeton  
prize for progress in religion. She  
is the founder of St. Christo-  
pher’s Hospice in London, a  
facility visited annually by hun-  
dreds of doctors and others to  
learn its innovative approach.  
Dr. Saunders’ methods are now  
in worldwide use.  

Nuclear Plant Leak  

Lower Alloways Creek, N.J. —  
Low levels of radioactive  
material began to leak from a  
waste-gas compressor pump at  
the Salem I nuclear power plant  
recently, necessitating the eva-  
cuation of 10 workers from an  
auxiliary building, authorities  
said. The leak was discovered by  
a scanner used to detect radia-  
tion levels on employees leaving  
the buildings. The alert lasted  
over two hours and was can-  
celled after the leak was stopped  
and “higher than normal” levels  
of radiation were dissipated. A  
Public Service Electric & Gas  
spokesman said radiation levels  
were given a clean bill of health.  

Anti-Abortion Bill Stalled  

Montpelier — The State  
Senate recently refused to con-  
sider a bill that would allow only  
doctors to perform abortions,  
sidetracking the anti-abortion  
measure aimed at curtailing the  
Vermont Women’s Health Cen-  
ter. The bill was stalled in the  
Judiciary Committee and the  
vote means the measure will die  
there unless abortion foes can  
find another legislative avenue to  
get the full Senate to consider it.  
While the action makes it  
more difficult for abortion foes  
to get the bill debated this year,  
they could still put the measure  
in as an amendment on another  
bill. The longer the bill is tied up  
in the Senate, the less chance  
there is it will be considered in  
the House in 1981.

ATROCITIES  

Atrocities compiled by  
Maxine Merrick from stories in  
the Burlington Free Press and  
other sources.  

Woman Accosted  

Rutland police said an 18-  
year-old woman was accosted by  
a man as she walked on Pleasant  
Street March 25. Brian P.  
Tuliper pleaded innocent to the  
charge of lewd and lascivious  
conduct stemming from the  
incident.  

The man wrestled her into  
bushes and began fondling her,  
but the woman managed to  
escape after throwing a barrage  
of kicks at her assailant, police  
said.  

Vermont District Court  
Judge George Ellison placed  
Tuliper in the custody of the  
state Social and Rehabilitation  
Services Department. Tuliper,  
whose address is unknown, was  
given a warning not to associate  
with the victim and was ordered to abide by  

Lures 13-Year-Old  

A 29-year-old Bennington  
man was charged with sexual  
assault stemming from allega-  
tions that he lured a 13-year-old  
girl into a Bennington residence.  

Police said Robert Sprague,  
of East Main Street, was being  
held at the Bennington lockup in  
lieu of $10,000 bail until  
arraignment. He was arrested  
after a warrant was issued.  

Woman Beaten  

A Londonderry man  
accused of beating a Derby  
woman whom he thought had  
custody of his dog pleaded  
innocent to the charge in Ver-  
mont District Court.  

Police claimed in an affida-  
vit that Timothy J. Chila, a  
21-year-old carpenter, broke the  
door casing and lock at Char-  
lotte Gonet’s home and then  
struck her.  

Chila claimed he was  
assaulted by the woman, accord-  
ing to the affidavit. He was  
released on personal recogni-  
zance.  

Wife-Beating  

A Brandon man was  
released on recognizance after  
pleading innocent in Vermont  
District Court to a wife-beating  
charge.  

Brandon police reported  
they saw Frederick Nichlen, 28,  
of 68 Grove Street, pushing his  
wife and he had apparently been  
drinking. Police also reported  
they saw cuts on Esther Nich-  
len’s eye and bruises on her head  
and left arm.  

A judge released Nichlen  
warning him not to harass or  
“interfere with the personal  
liberty” of Mrs. Nichlen.  

Sexual Assault  

A St. Johnsbury man on  
parole for rape and aggravated  
assault in Orleans County has  
been convicted of two counts of  
sexual assault on a 17-year-old  
girl.  

John F. Shattuck, 34, alle-  
gedly asked the girl for a ride  
then raped her in a remote area  
of St. Johnsbury Town and later  
on a ball field at St. Johnsbury  
Academy August 9, 1980.  

Vermont District Court  
records show Shattuck earlier  
received concurrent prison sen-  
tences for raping and assaulting a  
woman in Derby in 1976.  

Man Acquitted  

A 19-year-old Burlington  
man accused of having grabbed a  
woman by the buttocks was  
acquitted of a charge of lewd  
and lascivious conduct. Scott  
Robar, of Riverside Avenue, had  
originally been charged with  
stemming from the incident. The  
charge was later changed to the  
felony allegation for which he went to  
trial in Vermont District Court.  

The woman was allegedly  
walking home from Burlington  
High School on a bicycle path.  

Assistant Public Defender  
John Franco said a jury of nine  
women and three men deliber-  
ated about an hour before  
returning the verdict. He said the  
essence of his closing argument  
to the jurors was that the charge  
amounted to “trying to kill a fly  
with a sledgehammer.”  

Attn — Dalkon Shield Users  

Women who have ever used  
a Dalkon Shield (a crab-shaped  
IUD) and had any problems may  
be able to take part today in a  
national class action suit against  
the manufacturer, Robbins.  
Robert Manchester of Burling-  
ton is one of the lawyers invol-  
ved in the case.  

In a suit such as this, the  
more women involved as plain-  
tiffs, the greater the settlement  
can be and the more validity  
there is to the claim that the  
IUDs were dangerous.  

Women who would like to  
be involved in the suit or who  
have information should contact  
Robert Manchester at 864-5756.
