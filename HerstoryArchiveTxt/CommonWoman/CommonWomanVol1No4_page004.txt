Shoplifting, when done with
some political consciousness, is a
personal and political statement
and a method of survival for a
respectable number of people in

Burlington.

stores, owned by corporate America,
are fair targets. It is the
corporations which support high
unemployment which in turn
keeps wages low. It is corporate
America which finds tax
loopholes which the middle and
lower classes must then pay for.
It is corporate America which
supports the groups working for social
change. Conscientious
shoplifters, for example, might
not rip off The Frayed Page
Bookstore because they are a
clearinghouse for social action
information, or Bookstacks,
because they’re a worker-owned
collective.

But other stores, chain stores

shoplifting is
higher prices.

We must survive. People
shoplift warm clothes and boots
to get themselves and their
families through the winter.
People shoplift “nice” clothes,
to wear to job interviews
knowing that clothes do make a
difference, and they can’t get
them any other way. Those who
have chosen ‘not to sell their lives
to corporate America shoplift
for survival.

The risks are there. It is easy
to get caught. Legislatures are
passing laws which allow
merchants to detain anyone

myth that
responsible for

acting suspiciously (what kind of
criterion is that?!). Judges are
handing out stiffer sentences.
The hand on the shoulder as you
walk out of the store and the
whole arrest procedure are
terrifying.

But it is also good training for
revolutionaries: being subversive,
being careful, hiding, not letting
fear of arrest prevent action. It is
good training for survival.

Aside from its value as a
material survival skill, shoplifting
is a way of staying sane in a
society that uses its most
up-to-date techniques to
convince us that we need its
products, then denies us the

wherewithal to purchase them.
It makes people feel better, not
so oppressed, like they have
struck back. It is a statement to
the corporations, saying, ‘You
don’t own me.” Corporate
America hasn’t gotten the
message yet, though it seems
obvious from the increasing
incidence of shoplifting among
all classes and the problem it
poses for corporate profits.
Shoplifting will soon be on
the decline, however. Corporate
America is concentrating its vast
resources on new systems, some
of which are unbeatable. But for
now, it is a viable way of
surviving and striking back.

Growing up

Once, I wrote to a friend and
in the process of writing I
discovered my ambivalent
feelings about being Eurasian in

Vermont. I described a ride I
took with my paternal
grandparents and my sister.

Crickets were trilling; the sun
was just setting, sending out long
streamers of lavender,
reddish-pink and yellow. A lone
doe stood against that sky,
looking toward us with one
forefoot raised and ears alert.
Silence held us as my
grandfather slowed, then
stopped the car so we could
watch the scene. The beauty of
Vermont.

With hardly any transition at
all, I found myself writing about
my mother. How lovely — yet
alien — Vermont must have
seemed to her. As a traditional

Japanese war bride, she expected
to be more of a servant to her
in-laws than to her husband. I
know she would have felt
nervous around my father’s
parents, not knowing their
expectations and being without
the traditional reprieve of going

to visit her parents since they
were half a world away from
Vermont.

I do not know how this image
of my mother as a lonely,
frightened alien stayed with me
since she died when I was four.
However, I have questioned my
relatives and confirmed this
picture I held as a child which is
almost too dim to be called a
memory. Yet that portrait
helped protect me as a Eurasian
— or more accurately — a
half-breed growing up in a White
world. I could try to be White
(knowing I would never be fully
accepted); I could try to be
invisible or I could be Third
World.

My father’s family was a
hindrance in the process of
growing up. They loved me in
their fashion, but I was pressed
to call myself White. At the
same time, the relatives referred
to my brother, sisters and me as
the ‘Japanese kids;’ not once
did I hear my cousins, whose
mother was German, referred to
as the “German kids.” This gave
me the feeling that I should be
ashamed of my Japanese blood.

Somehow, it was unacceptable

to be what I was.

I watched my brother and
sisters gradually accept those
lessons. My brother married a

Eurasian

By Margaret Cornell

woman from Alabama whose
favorite pastime was telling how
her people — bigots — kept the
“niggers” in their place. My
brother seemed to have
forgotten that those people who
were so willing to call Black

people ‘“‘niggers’’ were also
willing to call him a “Jap.” My
sisters, too, gave in by

disassociating themselves from
any part of their Asian heritage.
There was a time when we
smiled quickly at each other
whenever we saw an Asian face.
It was a relief to know that we
were not the “only ones” — a
freak accident in Vermont.

I spent four years, from sixth
grade to ninth grade, in almost
total isolation, taunted as a
“Jap.” Pride and silence were
the main weapons I had.
Sometimes, I yelled names back;
many times I fought to defend
myself from physical attacks. I
tried talking to my teachers, my
father, my step-mother, and my
guidance counselors. With the
exception of one guidance
counselor who was overruled by
the principal, everyone evaded
the issue. They implied it was
my fault for not learning to
ignore them. Finally, I became

in Vermont

sullen, withdrawn and ready to
explode into fits of rage or
self-pity. Such scenes were rare,
since I learned a relentless
self-discipline to protect my
vulnerability. However, the one
insult I could not overlook was
one directed towards my
mother. The memory of her
protected me against the lies I
was told.

I was told that I was learning
American history in school but
what I was really learning was

the American myth, the story of
its triumphs “defending” against

foreign invasion and
Communism. In short, the
glorification of genocide.

Nowhere did the history book
tell the story of Asian American
women and men who — to give
two examples of their
contributions — built the most
difficult part of the
Transcontinental Railroad and
helped make Hawaii and the
West Coast the rich agricultural
centers they are today. The true
story of the bombing of Pearl
Harbor was never taught in spite
of the existence of government
documents.

Essentially, very little has
changed since my childhood.
American children are still
taught lies and distortions
instead of the history and — just
as important — the herstory of
America. The most intimate
victims of American racism are
the children who do not
understand racism, and no
Vermont institution is prepared
to deal with that. It has to
change, it just has to, and it's
gonna be a long, long fight. And
meanwhile I have a two-year-old
daughter.
