No Nuke Groups

By Lynn Rockwell

Since the 1978 demonstra-
tion at the site of the Seabrook
Nuclear Power Plant, a number
of groups have formed in Ver-
mont to continue working
towards safe, renewable sources
of energy, and against nuclear
power. The following is a brief
summary of only five of these
groups. Active groups exist as
well in the Northeast Kingdom,
the White River area, and in
Southern Vermont.

Burlington Safe Energy
Coalition was formed in Sep-
tember 1978, with the explicit
goal of stopping the use and
development of nuclear power,
and the promotion of safe
alternatives. BSEC has sponsored
monthly events which include
panel discussions, film showings,
and lectures on energy issues.
Recently, BSEC organized a safe
energy fair. In addition, BSEC
publishes No Nukes News, a
weekly newsletter highlighting
nuclear energy-related news.
Currently, BSEC is involved with
testifying at the Public Service
Board hearings reviewing the
request by Green Mountain
Power and Central Vermont
Public Service Corporation to
buy into the financially troubled
Seabrook Nuclear Plant. BSEC
meets weekly, Mondays at 7:00
p.m., at Saint Paul’s Church in
Burlington. It is organized into
education and communication
committees. Subscriptions to the
No Nukes News are available by
writing: BSEC, 377 St. Paul St.,
Burlington, Vt. 05401.

Charlotte Affinity Group
has been meeting since June
1978, and has focused on local
education projects and the
health aspects of nuclear power.
Members of the group are
presently involved with solar
construction and have promoted
safe energy through exhibits at
local fairs. For more information,
write: Box 38, Charlotte, Vt.

The Sunrise Affinity Group
was formed in Burlington prior
to the planned occupation of the
Seabrook Nuclear Plant, and
meets every other Wednesday.
This group has focused on
short-term projects including
showing films to local groups
and high school classes, and
leafleting at showings of The
China Syndrome. Sunrise has
been active in publicizing and
attending public hearings on the
uranium mining bill and the
Public Service Board hearings on
the potential Seabrook buy-in.
Presently, Sunrise is designing a
course to be taught at the
Church Street Center. For more
information, write: Sunrise, 10
Charles St., Burlington, Vt.
05401.

In Montpelier, the Central
Vermont Safe Energy Coalition
has opened an office at 5 State
St. CVSEC has an excellent
local library of reading materials,
meeting space, and a volunteer
staff. It is coordinating the
Vernon Decommissioning Alli-
ance (see below) and sponsors
actions and education
projects concerning nuclear
power and safe energy options.
For more information, write or
call: CVSEC, 5 State St., Mont-
pelier, Vt. 05602, Tel.
223-7222.

The Vernon Decommission-
ing Alliance is a relatively new
group of people from Vermont,
New Hampshire, and western
Massachusetts who have been
meeting since April to plan a
shutdown of the Vermont Yan-
kee Plant in Vernon, Vt. Most
planning meetings have taken
place on alternate Sundays
either in Montpelier or South
Royalton. Presently, three task
forces are working toward long
term training and education, an
action in Vernon and Rutland
on Sept. 22, and ongoing local
actions. For more information,
write or call CVSEC (see above).

The five organizations men-
tioned here are all volunteer
groups made up of working
people, many with family com-
mitments. While there are com-
petent professionals working
towards the same goals, they can
not do the job alone. In the end,
it will be the combined effort of
all people that will bring us to a
sane energy policy. The groups
that are active need help to carry
out their stated goals. We have
no choice but to continue to
organize, educate, and agitate.
No Nukes.

The Mountain

I picked myself the fastest horse
And leapt upon its back,

And we rode like the dust of morn
Into the depth of the desert.
The wind knew our goal,

And he tried to deter us,

And the sand, as his partner,
Grabbed for the flesh of our feet.
But our muscles were strong
And our souls were on fire,

And we slaughtered our foes
And pursued our huge quest.

— There it stood watching

As we swiftly approached it.

It held out its hands

And called us by name,

And we ran to it freely
And embraced its steep slopes.
The mountain of sisterhood
Had found us at last.

—Anne Ericson

Jeanne Wheeler, a local
womyn, is presently being incar-
cerated at the Chittenden Com-
munity Correctional Center,
better known to the inmates as
the Four Seasons. Her crime:
Passing bad checks in order to
feed herself, a friend, and her
friend’s son.

Jeanne has been unable to
work since January because of a
back injury sustained from a fall
on the ice while at the site of her
last employment. She has had an
insurance claim against the com-
pany since then but has only
received to date $540. Not much
to pay off lawyers’ fees, rent, and
have anything left over for food.

Two weeks ago, Jeanne
began serving an eight to twelve
month sentence for her crime.
The mental pressure is great.
They want you to break. They
decide what is “normal” and
you have to bear up under it.
Jeanne tells me you get written
up for crying. Getting written
up does not help you get off
earlier for good behavior, which
she hopes to get. She could be
released as early as mid-Novem-
ber.

Yesterday, I visited Jeanne
with three other womyn. After
about 40 minutes, two of the
womyn had to leave. We sat
there mostly groping for words,
afraid to touch, while at the
same time three straight couples
made out passionately in the
corner. This is allowed by the
prison staff — blatant reinforce-
ment of heterosexual values.

Letters of support are grate-
fully received in care of Jeanne
Wheeler, 7 Farrel St., South
Burlington, Vt. 05401. She can
be reached by phoning
864-9664. Visiting hours are
Tuesday, 1:30-2:30 p.m.; Thurs-
day, 1:30-2:30 p.m.; and Satur-
day, 1-3 p.m.

WOMYN: Please send letters
of protest and support to Judge
Costello, 39 Pearl St., Burling-
ton, and also to Tom Garrett,
State’s Attorney.

It is also important to send
letters urging them to let Jeannie
out on work-release so that she
can have as much freedom as
possible. This womyn should be
let out of jail and given a good
job.

Sisters — Unite — Support
Sisters.

For more information, call
Patte or Meeghan at 864-0601.

(Editor’s Note: Arlene
Barnes, a womyn from New
York, is also in the Chittenden
Community Correctional Center
and wants letters and visitors.)
