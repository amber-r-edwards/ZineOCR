They Tell Me I Am American

They don’t treat me like
an American

They Tell Me I Am American

Or Did They Lie?

I don’t know America
I don’t think American
I don’t feel American

I don’t speak American

Am I?

—Gwen Shervington

“I find myself, more and
more, using quotation marks to
express irony. The thought
occurs: as my consciousness
level rises, will I finally put the
entire world-as-it-is in quotes?”

AT SUCH AN HOUR

Poetry seems obscene

At such an hour;

Four in the morning,

I'm awake

And my relationship

Is slowly unraveling

With the months.

The two may not

Be connected:

Lack of sleep

And my relationship,

But dawn

Is a lovely time

Of the day.
—Michiyo Cornell

POETRY

DECEMBER, 1979

No.

My heart isn't broken;

It beats

And pumps blood

Ah, but I think of you

And my heart feels heavy.

I see you

In life all around me:

Such gray December weather

Doesn't help me feel better,

Yet if the sun were shining

It would seem too cruel.
—Michiyo Cornell

Rhythms and to

your words

your bones
between midnight moans
and morning koans
the unknowns
shown

her face

grace

illumes this place
our words

our bones

our rhythms

our tones

Sappho whispers.
From the past

she comforts,

we must go on
sharing

living our poetry,
filling the pages

of unwritten books
in this,

our season of grace.

In ordinary places
we gather.

The sounds

of our friendship
love

and laughter
soothes

and moves

easily on the breeze,
sunny and vibrant
in the creation

of our own lesbos.

Amid the soft murmurs

of my sisters

I am there with you,

your beauty

somewhere between Gwen

and Ingrid Bergman.

Free, I wander

naked

over your island

your soul

in this,

my season of grace.
—Baba Rose
