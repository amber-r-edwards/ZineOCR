Bearing a Sister

By W. Sency Powell

Judith Hope Davis is a
psychic, a healer and a leading
member of the Church of the
Eternal Life and Light. Both the
formation of the Church in 1975
and the fact of her coming to
central Vermont she attributes
to direction from the higher
planes. Many local women will
remember her from the May
“Women Women Women”
conference, at which she gave a
talk on women’s spirituality.
Although at that time she
identified some qualities which
have historically been attributed
to women (the positive side of
endurance, nurturance, et al.),
she prefers to look at people in
terms other than sexual ones:
hers is a humanistic rather than
gender-defined view.

For women who have found
their identity as women only
after the long years of struggle
which patriarchal society
demands, this approach may be
hard to accept. The politically
aware woman who considers
society as a sex/class/race
struggle may find the essentially
passive, positive concepts of
Judith’s New Age message to be
irrelevant or “unrealistic.”
Promulgating a doctrine of love
and non-resistance may seem, to
feminists and (other) radicals,
nice-but-not-real, or even
dangerous. To live by true
Christian dogma — loving others,
in harmony with one’s world —
would be wonderful, but, we ask
ourselves, (with visions of
rapists, fire-bombers, and
wife-beaters in our heads) is it
possible? Judith’s answer is, “Of
course. Just let go.” There is an

enormous “leap of faith”
required — and the worldly
woman may refute the

possibility and the validity of
attempting it. For the believer,
this is just perpetuating the body
of fear which is one of
patriarchy’s bequests to us. At
the very least, it is continuing to
accept the either/or dichotomy
which has been foisted upon us.

There is no empirical test for
the teaching of mystics. Because
spirituality, in the frequent guise
of religion, has been misused so
many times in the past, people
tend to hyper-react to it, or at
least be very critical. This is even
more true when the speaker is a
woman. Judith Hope Davis is
not operating primarily in the
societal dimension: her lack of a
political focus must be tolerated,
“given space.” As a young
woman who is developing and
using her own (and higher)
power, she deserves the respect
and support of her sisters and
brothers.

Interview with Judith Hope
Davis

Q. Most people probably know
of you through the readings and
healings that you do. What are
you doing in a reading? What are
some of the expectations people
have?

A. A reading is a healing on a
soul level. Some people come to
me wanting to be told what to
do. They are almost never told,
because we are not here to run
people’s lives, just to help out...

I’m a telephone for the Universal

Consciousness, or Infinite
Source... First, we sit down and
have a prayer and meditation, at
which time the aura unfolds.
Basically, auras are compact in
daily living; they’re very seldom
fully expanded. People who have
drug experiences — alcohol too,
sometimes experience
expanded auras, and they
become vulnerable to other
levels of energy that can be
detrimental if they aren't
equipped to handle it. When
your aura is expanded in the
reading, you're in a very
protected environment, because
you're surrounded in White
Light. The blocks that a person
may have developed in any area
will manifest in the etheric
body, which is contained within
the physical, emotional, mental
and spiritual bodies. These, in
turn, are all part of the physical
body. It’s like a magnetic-electric
network of energy. When
the aura is expanded, everything
comes forward so that it can be
dealt with through recognition
and acceptance, and then
removed. The individual is
brought to look at the
obstruction, see its positive and
negative effects and how it's
been working in their lives. They
can then deal with it on the
rational level, which is where
most people are functioning.
Different things are given to
people as to what they can do so
that the block doesn’t re-enter,
and how they can work their
own personal alchemy.

Q. What actually happens to you
during a laying on of hands?

A. There’s an energy that passes
through my body that can be
channeled to heal other bodies. I
believe that all people have that
energy. First they must use it for
themselves. Until you heal
yourself emotionally,
mentally, spiritually — until you
have that inner integration, you
can’t really heal others. It’s
related to a person’s faith... Everybody has to live
their own Karma, and it's a
beautiful thing. To deal with
that positively, meet it with
strength — that’s the assistance
that’s given in the reading or
healing.

Q. I know that some people
question taking money for
readings.

A. I take money because it was
part of my direction.... I never
thought about it until people
started asking me, “Why are you
doing that?”... I have a body
that has to eat, has to have
clothes, I have kids. I can do
more good for humanity being
paid for readings and trying to
build the Church than I can
working at a drugstore. A lot of
people get hung up in money,
just because they want to get
down on somebody for
something, and money's a good
place. It’s like saying, “She’s
doing something wrong, I know
she must be doing something
wrong.” Sure, maybe I am doing
it wrong. I don’t know. I don’t
think so.

Q. What about when a person
wants to help another, and yet
she’s not feeling too together.
Would that somewhat negative
energy be a hindrance?

A. Oh, no, you'll never get there
if you do that — wait for
perfection. You will never be a
healer until you lay your body
down and become a servant to
humanity. As long as you don’t
lay your body down, you're just
a slave to your own pain...

Q. Do you mean we should stop
placing so much importance on
the physical?

A. No, I don’t mean just the
physical body, to just forget the
physical and move into higher
realms of consciousness, but to

lay down your body of pain,
fear, and anxiety; that which
creates separations between all
of us. That’s your body of pain.
There are very few people at this
point in the evolution of the
race consciousness that do not
have an intense body of pain. If
you function through your body
of pain, it’s very hard to effect
any positive change...

Q. Why do you think there’s so
much fear, to lay that aside, to
go beyond?

A. Because most of us worship
the Lord of Reason, instead of
the Infinite. If we didn’t worship
reason, we would have faith in
our own Christ Consciousness.
As it is, we rationalize it all out.

We get hung up in the
mechanics, instead of the
dynamics... At this point, the

biggest obstruction to change is
everybody resisting everything
around them. We need to
become non-resistant, and
accepting, and then to move
forward: as we resist, we waste
energy. The revolution is going
on; it’s a revolution of
consciousness. Everybody is
doing their part, even if they
don’t want to. To fight is just to
create more turmoil and
difficulty. If we give other
people the respect and love they
need — grant them that space for
their reality — if all people did
that, everybody could achieve
their personal freedom.

Q. Many people, in thinking
about this, have a problem with
loving and accepting what
actively cuts into their life and
space.

A. But how can it cut into your
space if you're not resisting? Say
another person is really being
dominant. If you resist that and
fight that, indeed, they will cut
into your space. They already
have because you're resisting,
you're hassled, you're uptight. If
you can look at the person and
say, “All right, I can see this is
where you're coming from. This
is your reality, but my reality is
this." If we're all true to
ourselves, no one can infringe on
us... When we brand evil, it
becomes twice as strong — we
lend it power... This is an
incredible time of positive and
negative. People are dealing with
the negativity within themselves
really intensely...

Q. Yet there is fear in many of
us who are aware of threatening
forces out there, both cosmic
and on the earth plane. It’s hard
to have faith and say, “I know
they will not harm me.”

A. They can’t touch you.
Someone could rush in here and
blow my body to bits. They’d
never touch me. We are
indestructible. We are immortal
souls. Once we realize our
immortality, and the continuity
of life, truth will become the
main issue. Dealing with inner
truth — so that we don’t go
through life compromising. Why
are we afraid? Because of the
compromise that living in
society requires of us. It takes
our freedom. In this day and
age, who in their right, sane
mind, who is really being
objective, can be afraid of that
which is around us? My God, all
we hear are the death throes of
the beast!

Q. Can you speak a little about
women’s special power? How
can we better harness that, when
it may seem like others are
directing us?

A. The curses for women are, I
believe, ultimately a blessing. It’s
only because they haven't been
grasped. Women are calling out
that they’ve been shafted, and
from higher planes it looks like
we've all been shafted — men,
women, and children. Because
it’s such an imbalance. Nobody
has any power, everybody is
operating through a body of
fear. And that’s not power.
Dominance is not power. The
only power that’s of any use
whatsoever is the power of life,
which is the power of love.

Q. That's women’s power.

A. I don’t believe that. How
many of the women in the
women’s movement were men
just 75 years ago? That’s the
point I have to bring up. I do see
karma — you can't segregate or
isolate...

Q. Some women believe that we
are always reincarnated as
women.

A. I'll tell you — most of the
women who have suffered
directly from the patriarchy are
some of the old patriarchs
getting their due... Like some of
the Indians on the reservations.
My belief is that some of them
were the white men who tore
the Indians’ lands from them...
We are here to experience the
sum total of life. I think it’s
sheer idiocy to think that life is
one sided... Women are more
clear only because they've been
given more time... Patience
ultimately is like a doorway to
the Infinite.

Q. It’s no accident that you
came to Vermont? There's a
group of people that you'll be
working with, isn’t that right?

A. A massive spiritual
undertaking is at hand. A new
path is going to be offered.
Everybody is going to be
working toward that... not
unlike the time when Jesus
came. It will be mind-altering.
There’s an individual who is
going to release the body of pain
from the earth — that has been
predicted since before the time
of the White Goddess, before
they came and burned her
temples, before they destroyed
all the works that Diana did. It
was predicted then that there
would be a savior in the
Aquarian Age, and that she
would release the body of pain.
It's time. Doesn’t it look that
way?
