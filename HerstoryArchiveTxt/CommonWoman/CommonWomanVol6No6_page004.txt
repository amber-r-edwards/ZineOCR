House

The Brattleboro Retreat
takes pleasure in announcing the
addition of an Adult Transitional
Treatment Program at
Ripley House, one of our
residential centers. The programs
are for individuals recovering
from complex psychiatric or

addiction problems.

This program will serve the
individual who is moving from a
dependent situation (family or
hospital) to one of more
independence.

In the open setting of
Ripley House, treatment is
focused on the preparation of
the patient to resume normal
living in the community.

Women

We are women who belong
to an organization in the Upper
Valley called Women Against
Nuclear Development, better
known as WAND. We want to
speak out about the proposed
opening of a pornographic busi-
ness in White River Junction
because we see a similarity
between the violence that occurs
when a nuclear plant emits
radioactive poison into the
environment or when a nuclear
bomb is dropped upon a nation
and its people and the violence
that is displayed and encouraged
by the pornographic industry in
this country. As women working
toward an end to the threat of
a nuclear disaster in our lives, we
feel compelled to also work
towards preventing in our own
community the selling and glori-
fication of brutality and oppres-
sion of women and children that
is portrayed in pornographic
materials.

Every woman in this coun-
try is aware that she is vulner-
able to being raped or battered,
whether she walks the city
streets, the country roads, or
even stays within the privacy of
her own home. Every 18 seconds
a woman is battered in this
country, and every three min-
utes, another woman is raped.
This goes on in our own com-
munities and in many of our
own lives. We do not always hear

Last Kids
on Earth

On Monday, November 29
about 30 womyn and children
attended a puppet show at EWP
created and performed by Joni
and Tana. The show is called
“The Last Kids on Earth” and
includes animated dialogue and
some songs about kids who
successfully stop the slaughter of
baby seals through broom flying
and direct action.

Against

about it. The reason that many
of the violent crimes against
women and children are not
reported is because women have
been made to feel that such
violence is normal behavior of
men or that the woman is to
blame for the man’s behavior.
Not only is violence against
women and children an integral
part of our culture, it is firmly
institutionalized so that the
victim of the violence is por-
trayed as the criminal.

Pornography is a lucrative
business in this country. In
1979, there were nearly four
times as many porn stores as
McDonald's. The porn industry
grosses more money than the
film and recording industries
combined. The majority of por-
nographic films and magazines
display women and children
as objects to be violated —
mutilated, abused, dominated,
objectified, exploited and ridiculed. To many men, such
treatment is sexually titillating
because of the culture we have
been brought up in. To many
women, such treatment is insult-
ing, fearful and a potential
threat to our lives. We find
it abhorrent that such behavior
is condoned and promoted and
that it thrives as a profitable
business.

We live in a society of
misconceptions and lies. Nuclear
power and weapons are seen as

and for having survived with so
little financial assistance for four
years. “We have shown an
amazing ability to survive.”
We're trying to figure out how
we do it and how to keep doing
it. We plan to use the money
primarily for Outreach: to
increase circulation and distri-

bution of the paper. We also
need to increase participation in
the paper and want to take this
opportunity to put out an
invitation to all of you to work
on Commonwoman. It's fun to
work on Commonwoman. Call
863-3586 or 863-2377.

Women Kill Their Husbands.”

to The Fat Liberation
Group on their $500 Haymarket
grant. This EWP sponsored
group is holding a community
meeting open to all large women
to give input on what to do with

p.m. at EWP.

Pornography in White River

acceptable and necessary forms
of production and defense. Por-
nography is seen as an accept-
able form of sexual expression.
They are both calculated mis-
conceptions.

Pornographic material pre-
sents an image that sanctions
and promotes violence against
women and children. This image
filters down, consciously or
unconsciously, to how we treat
each other in this society. We
must change the images and
misconceptions.

Nuclear plants emit life-
threatening radiation, even dur-
ing normal operation; they must
be stopped. Nuclear bombs and
the stockpiling of nuclear
weapons threaten our lives; they
must be eliminated. The porno-
graphic industry, in promoting
abusive and violent treatment of
women and children, must not
be allowed to exist in our
community. As women who are
working toward a nuclear free
world, we are also working
toward a violence free world,
especially in our own commu-
nities. We demand that violence in
any form against individuals or
groups be stopped at its roots.

To the Editor:

This letter is in response to
the opening of a pornography
store in White River Junction.

We are women who work
DAILY with women who have
been assaulted or raped.

We believe that porno-
graphy is a direct cause of
violence against women. In the
pornography available today,
women are depicted as sex
objects, as slaves, as targets for
men’s hostility. The objectifica-
tion of women and the portrayal
of women as seductive and
submissive feeds into misogynist
(women-hating) practices, such

as rape and battering. Louis

Hamlin Sr. had barrels of porno-
graphy in his home, and was
arrested for molesting a teenage
relative. His son murdered a
12-year-old Essex girl. What are
we teaching our children when
we have pornography depicting
women being raped, tied up,
women being put through meat
grinders (Hustler 1980), women
being tortured, and young child-
ren shown being raped, assaulted? 
Child pornography is
increasing at an alarming rate.
How many murders of women
and children must occur before
anything is done about the fact
that porn shops now outnumber
McDonald's in America? All
people must start protesting the

images of violent acts against
women and children that are
being printed. Pornography is a
billion dollar industry that capi-
talizes on men’s lust and
women’s vulnerability. Local
communities such as this one
can organize to prevent porn
shops in our hometowns, to
protect our children and our-
selves from messages that are
dangerous and harmful to us.
Write to your local papers, speak
out at every opportunity, let
your town officials know that
you do not accept pornography
which leads to more violence
against women and children.

A woman is beaten every
eighteen seconds.

One out of four female
children will be sexually molested.

These are F.B.I. statistics!

Join us in fighting the
perpetuation of sexism and
violence. Voice your objections
today.
