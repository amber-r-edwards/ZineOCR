Rape is a  
possibility in every one of our!  
(AFTER SOME QUIET TIME,  
THE SUBJECT CHANGES  
AGAIN AND SOMEONE PRO-  
POSES A THEORY)  

—If you start masturbating  
late in life, you do it by touch-  
ing your clitoris directly. And, if  
you start early, it’s indirect  
clitoris, and maybe more with  
your fingers inside.  

I came out  
thought I could possibly  
stand the intensity of putting  
my fingers right on my clitoris. I  
didn’t even think of it. That's  
something that you have to  
know when you're making love  
with somebody. Some things  
hurt someone else that don’t  
hurt you. That even feel good to  
you.  

—Somehow, you're not sup-  
posed to say: ‘I’m going to get a  
urinary tract infection. Stop.”  

—It did happen the other  
day that I was hanging out with  
two friends. Having a good time.  
And someone said... let’s go get  
it on. You know, it’s like... I  
wanted to do it... and yet there  
was something there that was  
not o.k. about it. Or, there was  
some kind of complication.  
Yeah, I always cop to being a  
prude anyway.  

—I used to think being a  
prude was equal to frigid. Why is  
it prudish to say “no” to what  
you don’t want?  

—There’s a limit to knowing  
what you want.  

—Is it because it’s wrong, or  
because you truly and knowing  
yourself, just don’t want to do  
that?  

—People call women against  
pornography prudes.  
(ONE OF THE MEMBERS OF  
THE DISCUSSION COMES  
OUT OF THE BATHROOM  
AND SAYS)  

—I wonder how many peo-  
ple were wondering just now,  
when I went to the bathroom,  
that I went to masturbate?  

—So... Should prudes not be  
thinking something like that? Or  
is she a prude for NOT thinking  
of it?  

—Deodorant is prude.  
Prude: a woman who shows or  
affects extreme modesty.  

—Did we ever talk about  
sex?  

—Sex. People who are both  
asking.  

—We didn’t talk about age  
at all.  

—I’ve always been turned on  
to my mother.  

—I’ve always been turned on  
to my sister, and thinking that  
because she’s a dyke, sex was  
a possibility. I  
was upset when my sister  
stopped wrestling with me, in  
junior high school. Probably if  
she kept wrestling, she wouldn’t  
have had such a desire to fuck.  
The more physical things I did,  
fucking was the last thing in my  
mind.  
—I don’t remember ever  
consciously wanting to fuck. I  
just wanted some body contact.  
—J read that there's a rise of  
lesbians with women over 65.  

—Bigger and bigger num-  
bers. Good to make love in  
bigger and bigger numbers.  
—All women should come  
together.

FOR ADULTS OF ALL AGES  

BEGIN RE-VISIONING PSYCHOLOGY  

Our B.A. program in Transpersonal Psychology offers you a difference—an opportunity  
to revision education and the meaning of learning.  

Transpersonal Psychology, as a study of human nature, requires both imagination and  
discipline. From a solid grounding in traditional schools of psychology, our students  
move beyond the personal or ego-centered view of human nature to examine those  
transpersonal or universal dimensions that encompass the soul or spirit.  

Classes start January 24th. Apply soon.
