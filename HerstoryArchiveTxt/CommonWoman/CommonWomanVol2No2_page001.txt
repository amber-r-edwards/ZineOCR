Feeding Winooski’s Children

In Winooski, Vermont, the
children trudge to school twice a
day, making two trips back and
forth, because there is no lunch
program at all. An exception is
made for a few first and second
graders at the Winooski Memorial
School, who live in outlying
areas; from December to April
they may eat at school. The lack
of lunch facilities, in part caused
by lack of funds, in part the
result of a long-established tradi-
tion, makes Winooski unique
among Vermont towns.

On January 17, Rudolph
Morse, chair of the Vermont
Parole Board, testified before
the Senate Judiciary Committee
on compensation for victims of
crime. In his testimony, Morse
offered unsolicited comments on
the crime of battering women,
by stating: ‘Parolees beat their
wives, but the general attitude
with them seems to be this is
recreation rather than something
to be punished...” He further
offered that the women concur-
red in these beatings because “‘I
think they are masochists. I
think they torment the man
until he explodes because it
happens repeatedly.” (Quotes
from the transcripts of the
Senate Judiciary hearings.)

Morse’s comments were
picked up and reported by Louis
Berney of the Vermont Press
Bureau. The Central Vermont
Women’s Center’s January mem-
bership meeting happened on
1/18 and we were able to
respond to this latest attack
upon women immediately,
agreeing to call publicly for the
firing of Morse, and to meet
with our sisters in the Burlington
and Brattleboro communities to
plan a statewide response.
Governor Snelling’s office was
notified of our intentions to call
for Morse’s firing before it was
made public.

On Friday, already aware of
the political ramifications of his
comments, Morse apologized for

The problem in econo-
mically depressed Winooski,
where roughly a quarter of the
inhabitants are eligible for some
form of assistance, is that no one
wants a lunch program to be
paid for at their expense. Be-
cause it would have increased
taxes, the townspeople voted
down a bill three years ago

which would have provided
funds for a lunch program for
the school system's 1100 pupils.

The Winooski Alliance, a
“broad-based, multi-issue, direct

his ‘“smark-aleck” remarks. This
apology was accepted by Lt.
Gov. Kunin, Mr. Snelling and the
Governor’s Commission on the
Status of Women. Apparently
the government felt this would
then settle the issue for all
women.

But on Monday, 1/22, a
press conference calling for
Morse’s firing was held by
representatives of a coalition of
women’s groups whose member-
ship totaled over 500. Repre-
sented were: The Central Ver-
mont Women’s Center, Burling-
ton’s House of Transition, Brat-
tleboro Women’s Crisis Center,
Women Against Rape, Statewide
NOW, and the Coalition of
Ex-Battered Wives.

Peg Collins, Deane Britting-
ham, Betty Sheedy, Kay Chatot,
Sheril Grenier and Shirley Mar-
tindale, speaking for the groups,
emphasized the implications of
Morse’s remarks for women
trying to free themselves from
abuse, and stated an apology
from Morse was not enough to
assure that his prejudices against
women and prisoners would not
continue to influence the people
of Vermont. We also noted that
the comments by Morse could
be seen by some as condoning
violence against women, and
that therefore, it was necessary
for Morse to be removed from
office to show that this attitude
of violence against women was
not supported by the state.

action organization,” is an off-
shoot of the umbrella organiza-
tion, the Vermont Alliance, and
has roughly 80 members. It
conducted a survey this year in
which 83% of the respondents
were in favor of some sort of
lunch program, as long as it
meant no increase in taxes. A
hot lunch program was given
preference.

Donald Messier, Superin-
tendent of Schools and sole
spokesperson for the system,

explained his position succinct-

While Morse himself recognized
in his statements that abuse
“happens repeatedly,” his con-
clusion was to blame the victims
(women) for the abuse, not the
men or our society which okays
violence in general and which
does little to see the violence
committed against women in
particular. To paraphrase Filo
Kennedy, if abuse was a male
issue, laws would be long on the
books protecting men.

In addition to calling for the
dismissal of Morse, the ad-hoc
coalition had asked for a meet-
ing with Mr. Snelling. However,
Snelling refused to fire Morse, or
to meet with the ad hoc coali-
tion. In a letter to Brittingham
(1/24), Bill Gilbert, legal aide to
Snelling, stated “‘...inasmuch as
the Governor has made his
position clear... on the demands
of your group... it really would
not be productive to set up such
a meeting at this time on that
issue.”

Feeling that the needs of
the women of Vermont were
being ignored by male politi-
cians, an emergency meeting was
called to plan further strategies.
To make clear that we would
not give up our commitment to
battered women and to protest
the fact that the Governor
was ignoring all women by his
inactions, we agreed to take to
the streets for some street

ly. “There are no funds at
the state level. The legislature
has cut $165,000 in state aid —
we're cutting our budget, letting
teachers go, we'll have only the
minimum in supplies next year.
There’s simply no money for a
lunch program now. The kids get
an hour and a half off for lunch,
they have enough time to get
home and eat and get back." He
pointed out that the total area
of the school district has only a
one mile radius. “The kids love
it," he said.

would seem to
support the superintendent's
claim. Only seven of the 24
children at Winooski Memorial
who are eligible to bring a bag
lunch do so.

Besides the effect on the
children of walking up to four
miles a day in winter weather,
the lack of lunch facilities has a
major impact on parents. Some-
one has to be home to take care
of the children. Usually it’s the

Kunin Speaks

By Deb Ennis
More than fifty women
listened as Madelaine Kunin

shared her personal views on
women as advocates. The audi-
ence was drawn together for the
Vermont Women’s Health Cen-
ter annual meeting on February
26.

As a woman politician,
Kunin has been particularly
sensitive to the support she has
received from other women:
their interests, demands and
energy. Kunin acknowledges the
existence of a “deep, pervasive,
underground women’s move-
ment.” She believes it will not
surface as a significant political
force but that “the silent sup-
port is important."

Women are not a homo-
geneous group, therefore the
issues and approaches they take
as advocates for themselves will
vary. One of the big barriers
between women is the word
“feminist.” It is a frightening
term that turns away many
women who are uncomfortable
with that label, but feel just as
strongly about the issues. Kunin

also stated that women need to
work with men, “We can't blame
them for everything that’s gone
wrong.” She added that it is
important for women to set the
priorities and to have more
control.

In terms of what issues
women chose to become in-
volved with, Kunin made a
distinction between the tradi-
tional areas of women’s concerns
like child care, equal pay and
abortion and other political/economic issues. She advised against
limiting ourselves to one or two
issues because there are no
clear-cut distinctions and we
should be aware of any given
issue's broader implications.
Also, we should be careful lest
we be accused of acting solely
out of “self-interest.”
