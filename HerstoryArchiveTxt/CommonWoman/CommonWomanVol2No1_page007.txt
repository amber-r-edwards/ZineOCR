The  
Female  
Athlete  

By Louise Piche  

Will I develop breast cancer if  
I get hit in the chest with a  
tennis ball? Contact sports will  
injure the reproductive organs,  
won't they? Will swimming  
while I’m on the pill give me  
phlebitis? Will a female athlete  
sustain more fractures?  

The medical outcome of  
women’s rush into sports  
activity has not justified the  
original fears that these ‘fragile  
creatures’ would incur multiple  
injuries, destroy their  
reproductive organs, and develop  
masculine “bulging” muscles.  

Dr. Christine E. Haycock, a  
fencing champion and  
top-ranked softball pitcher and  
the first woman to be elected to  
the American Medical  
Association’s Committee on  
Medical Aspects of Sports, has  
done research to assess women  
athletes’ susceptibility to injury.  
Dr. Haycock, assistant professor  
of surgery at New Jersey College  
of Medicine and Dentistry, and  
chief of Surgical Emergency  
Services at New Jersey Medical  

School, in addition to being a  
surgeon, is a life-long athlete.  

Dr. Haycock contends that  
young girls should not be  
counseled against playing  
because they may injure their  

genitals or reproductive organs.  
This is nonsense! Female genitals  

are far better protected than  
male genitals. A girl’s genitals are  
inside her body, well protected  
by the pelvic bones. Her ovaries,  
her uterus and her tubes are  
virtually invulnerable to sports  
injury. In college sports, there  
have been no reported injuries of  
consequence to the female  
organs. And, in the very young  

girl, the reproductive organs  
aren't big enough to think about  
hurting. The most frequent  
injuries for girls and women are  
no different from those  
sustained by young boys and  
men: ankle and knee injuries.  

When questioned about blows  
to the breast, Dr. Haycock said  
that such blows, like blows to  
other body tissues, should be  
treated with hot soaks and  
aspirin for the hematoma (a  
hematoma is a blood-engorged  
swelling of tissues). Naturally,  
with the high incidence of breast  
cancer, physicians do wish to  
protect their patients. But so  
little has been written about the  
breast that physicians don’t  
know the risks. Will a blow to  
the breast stimulate a  
carcinoma? For Dr. Haycock,  
blows cause hematomas, a minor  
injury which heals quickly.  

Many women have received  
blows to the breast with no  
apparent long-lasting damage.  

THE VERMONT INSTITUTE  
OF COMMUNITY INVOLVEMENT  

They've been kicked by  
boyfriends, they've been bitten,  
they’ve been socked. They get  
contusions and abrasions, not  
cancer.  

How did the idea that blows  
to the breast cause cancer get  
such a strong hold in the medical  
community? Dr. Haycock set  
out to investigate. Years and  
years ago, the idea that a blow  
to the breast was possibly  
carcinogenic was printed in a  
surgical text. It was never  
discovered what the authors  
based this notion on. There is no  
literature to support this “old  
wives’ tale” that a blow to the  
breast can cause cancer.  

Of course, being hit in the  
chest hurts, even though there is  
no evidence that the damage is  
long lasting. A solution to the  
problem of breast injury would  
be to provide female athletes  
with protective devices for the  
breasts, just as male athletes are  
provided with protection for  
their testicles. Most athletes can  
benefit from breast protection  
and support. Certainly, fencers,  
goalies and catchers should  
always wear protective devices.  
Joan Gillette (a certified athletic  
trainer in Las Vegas, Nev.), Gail  
Shierman (professor of physical  
education at the State University  
of Oklahoma) and Dr. Haycock  
are in the process of designing a  
protective athletic bra. They've  
photographed women running to  
measure the motion of the  
breast. The exact amount of  
stress exerted on the breast is  
also documented by these  
biomechanical studies.  

Another myth about women’s  
athletics ferments in the minds  
of parents afraid that their
