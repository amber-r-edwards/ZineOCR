Learn About Berster!

Commonwoman Collective:

The disclaimer at the start of
the Kristina Berster article on
the front page of the September
issue shows a lack of education
on the part of someone or all of
your staff. This act of
non-support is an error in
political judgment. It is of
extreme importance that
Commonwoman educates itself
fully about this case. I believe
with education you will
understand the importance, the
necessity of your support for
Kristina. Her image — the one
that may have led you to the
decision to include the
disclaimer — is one created by
the press. Challenge that image
in yourselves. Learn all you can
about this trial. Confront your
evaluations of political actions
and their motivations — compare
those of the State (Vietnam War,
Kent State, Panther murders,
witch burnings) and those of
“terrorists” (photostating
government documents, hunger
strikes, demonstrations,
bombings). And confront too
the possibility, the reality, that
in this case a mistake has been
made — a deliberate lie that the
West German government is
perpetrating to punish Kristina
for her political work.
Governments all over the world
are responding to movements for
social and radical change by
irresponsibly throwing out labels
and charges like those hurled at
Kristina. Some feminists,
anti-nuclear power plant
demonstrators, anti-war activists
have been falsely accused of
violence that the State had a
much more valid claim to.
Kristina is a woman, a politically
active woman from a country
where the present and past
political climate is extremely
repressive. The power and the
responsibility that you all have
to affect this woman’s life is
reason enough to immediately
learn all you can about this case
and other cases like this
involving political activists. It is
of particular urgency that you
understand the role that the
media has played in jeopardizing
the lives of these political
women and men. The media in
all forms in West Germany, the
United States and around the
world has been infamously
responsible for the incarceration,
torture and death of political
prisoners.

Commonwoman, a small
Vermont woman's newspaper,
has an enormous responsibility
to provide perhaps the only
strongly supportive information
to the Vermont women’s
community. It is vital that you,
women who are working for
social change concerning
women’s issues, see yourselves in
Kristina Berster. Many of your
supporters, contributors, and
staff are women that could be
her, but are not at this moment
imprisoned. Articles that you
reject or accept, disclaimers that
you add, letters you print or
not, may vitally affect this case.
If your newspaper decided to
print “both sides of the story”
you will be redoing the work of
the straight press and the State
and lessening the impact you
could have in supporting this
woman. I feel that would be a
political mistake. Any woman in
your collective that feels
otherwise has a huge
responsibility to know this case
inside and out and understand
the media's effect on these cases
or should not take part in the
decision-making process
concerning the inclusion or
exclusion of information about
Kristina Berster in your
newspaper. Your decisions have
power that will motivate your
readers to help her or not in
many different ways. I believe
that interest and active help
from the women’s community is
necessary for this woman's
safety. I hope you will take part
in helping this support for her to
materialize.

Kristina Berster is at this time
in Chittenden County
Correctional Center in South
Burlington with virtually no
visiting rights. She is newly
learning about feminism,
women’s community support
and what that support might
mean.

To find out how you can be
of help call 862-8658 or
864-6186. Come to the federal
courthouse, demonstrate
outside, watch for
defense-sponsored events, make
donations of energy and/or
money to the Kristina Berster
Defense Committee, Box 144,
Winooski, Vermont.

not, or do not feel to be, a part.

What happens at The Mill is
unique in Burlington and
wonderful; I am glad to be a part
of it, and I hope that the strong
sense of women enjoying
themselves together will
continue.

I also hope that some straight
women and men will risk the
“feeling left out” and come join
us; I would like to hear from
them about how they feel when
they do. That way Linda and I
can stop guessing.

“Buy some flowers and
chocolates for your secretary”
the sign in the gift shop window
urges. When we read this, what is
the visual image that flashes
across our minds? A white,
well-groomed businessman with
graying temples stepping in to
buy a bouquet of roses for his
young and pretty female
secretary. It’s not surprising that
we make these associations since
99.1% of all secretaries are
women.

Recently we are hearing a lot
about the increasing percentage
of women in the labor force.
There are many personal interest
stories about women in
“unusual” occupations, about
professional women and about
women “making it” in a man’s
world. We are interested to hear
about women who are ministers,
managers, politicians, symphony
conductors and sportscasters.
Sometimes we even speculate
about the possibilities of a
woman being elected as
president of the United States.
But these are the glamorous and
exceptional positions. The truth
is that most (66%) women are
employed in clerical, service or
sales positions. The largest
employment gains for women
have been in occupations where
70% of all employees are already
women. In other words, most
women continue to be excluded
from entering the job fields that
are dominated by men. Women
continue to be confined to the
lower paying jobs with less
chance for advancement. It is
important to take a closer look
at the realities of women’s work
before we become too impressed
by the “new” and the “novel.”

Women have traditionally
been considered a “flexible”
workforce. They are available to
fill in during times of increased
need and when men aren't
available. This was the case
during World War II. Women
were encouraged to leave their
children with a sitter or at
daycare to work in the factories
making ammunition and other
war supplies. It was the
“patriotic” thing to do. The
government supplied adequate,
low-cost daycare services. But
when the war ended and the
men returned to flood the job
market, the image of the
All-American woman changed
drastically. Now, instead of
working productively in the
factories, she was supposed to
return happily to her
twenty-four hour (unpaid)
position as housewife. No more
funds were available for daycare
because women weren't needed
by big business or the
government.

57% of the salary that men
earned. Most women work due
to economic necessity — they
need the money to support
themselves and their families.
Only 31 out of 100 families are
supported by the husband’s
earnings alone. This means that
the rest are supported by a
combination of the husband and
wife's salary, or by the mother’s
salary alone. One out of eight
families in the United States are
headed by women, so obviously
these women are working for
more than “pin” money. The
working mother is in a double
bind.

A FEMINIST PRAYER

Our Mother, which art in heaven
Sister shall be thy name
Our washing's done, our kitchen’s
clean
On earth and it isn’t heaven.
Give us this day equality
And forgive us our disparagements
As we forgive those who
disparage against us.
And lead us not into Home
Economics,
But deliver us into politics,
For there is the power,
And the glory,
And the money, Forever...

Another way that the
women’s labor pool is used for
the benefit of the economy is
through part-time and
temporary jobs. Women today
comprise two-thirds of all
part-time workers. This is
because women must juggle their
jobs around their family
responsibilities and therefore
often are unable to assume
full-time, year-round
employment. Part-time and
temporary jobs provide few
benefits (like insurance,
retirement funds, sick days or
vacation time) and the pay is
low. Most part-time jobs are
unskilled, low status types of
work. For example, there are
few part-time managerial
positions. The bulk of part-time
work consists of waitressing,
sales help, nurses and store
clerks — all traditional women’s
employment, or “pink collar”
jobs. Less than 33% of American
women work full-time all year.
(For men the figure is 87%.)

“But women just work to
supplement their husbands’
incomes, for “pin money,” goes
the common belief. This
rationale allows many employers
and male employees to justify
the large difference between the
average salaries of men and
women. In 1974 women earned

A-Women

In this culture, where women
are primarily responsible for
child rearing, the mothers who
also work outside the home
must manage both jobs within a
society that poorly recognizes
their special needs. For example,
during school vacations, holidays
and summer break there are no
special provisions made for the
children of working mothers.
Medical appointments are
available only during “office
hours,” requiring mothers to
take time off work to bring the
kids to the doctor or dentist.
Some women have found it
financially more feasible to go
on welfare than to work and
meet the expenses of child care.

Stepping aside from the grim
statistics and external
considerations which face
women workers, let’s take a look
at some actual on-the-job
situations. Most women work
long hours for low pay. Most of
the time, women are paid less
for the same jobs that men do. A
woman is not given the same
amount of respect or treated as
seriously as a man. Women do
not have the same opportunities
for promotion as men do. One
reason for this is that the
company is unwilling to invest in
