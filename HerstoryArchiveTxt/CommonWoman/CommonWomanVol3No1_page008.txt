The sections of the follow-
ing article that are in quotes
were written by individual wim-
min in Music Midwives. They are
not credited individually because
they reflect the feelings and the
processes of all of us in Music
Midwives.

“Two and a half weeks!? It
isn't possible for the six of us to
produce a concert in two and a
half weeks. Especially when five
of us have never done this kind
of work before. But I want this
concert to happen here in
Burlington. It’s very important
to me. But it will take so much
of my time... and on and on I
wrestled with myself. Yet all
along I knew inside of myself
that if this concert was going to
happen, I was going to be part of
the production.”

Working with Music Mid-
wives and producing the Alive!
concert has been and still is a
time of intense sharing and
letting go of lots of things.

Music Midwives is a new
Wimmin’s production company
here in Burlington. It began
without a name, one womyn’s
vision and her experience in
wimmin’s production. It con-
tinues with the gathering of six
wimmin and their strong desire
to bring Alive!, a wimmin’s jazz
ensemble, from San Francisco to
Burlington; Music Midwives was
born and went on to birth their
first concert. It continues with
four wimmin who became so
enthralled with the excitement
of production work and the
fulfillment it offered that we
want to continue.

The most outstanding parts
of production work for us were:
how hard we worked, how close
we felt with each other, getting

to know the wimmin of Alive!
and dealing with money.

“At the first meeting, naive
as I was, I was planning on
working about ten hours per
week.”

Our working together
became a day and night obses-
sion. There were many decisions
to be made, long agendas, and
no time; the pressure of our
deadline made us all a little
panicked. We had to decide on
an appropriate location that we
could afford, on ticket prices,
ticket outlets, and on sales,
publicity, contacts, which piano
tuner to hire, how to find a
signer for the deaf and hard of
hearing, how to design posters
and flyers... and how to get
them distributed through bulk
mailing lists to volunteers. Most
of us were, at the same time,
working at other jobs and
responsibilities, and trying to fit
in Alive! business anywhere we
could squeeze a moment.

“It was hard work and it
was worth it. Many times I felt
like a robot, I was exhausted,
and I lost the perspective of
what I was doing. I would forget
that what I was doing was
bringing the spirited wimmin of
Alive! to Burlington. And then
they arrived in town and I was
reminded that there was a
purpose to this ‘madness’.”

The process of working very
closely on a project which had a
short time limit was very bond-
ing for us. Getting feedback on
our own work process and
watching each other’s strengths
and weaknesses became clearly
important. One womyn was
especially good at overall organ-
ization, another was good at
details, another could keep track

of money, another kept up the
paperwork, etc. We seemed to
have strengths which comple-
mented each other. We were
personally careful and suppor-
tive of each other to different
degrees.

“Working with the other
wimmin of Music Midwives was
intense. We worked really well
together, helped each other out
a lot, tried pretty successfully to
keep the process “as much a
priority as the project.”*

Through both the project
and process, money was a big
concern for us. The following
quote about money issues is
from the program at an Alive!
concert in Northampton, Mass.
It was written by Erin Davis, a
producer of that concert and
expresses our feelings too.

“In addition to our bond as
women, we are varied according
to our experiences, handicaps,
colors, and class backgrounds.
The flexibility of prices hope-
fully makes women’s culture
available to those of us who are
not privileged, in our employ-
ment and/or class backgrounds.
If you choose to pay by sliding
scale, consider your status in the
world. The following questions
are directed at raising issues
for us to think about. Are you
unemployed? If so, by choice?
Are you self-supported? What is
your earning power? Are you
short on money because of poor
planning? If ticket prices for the
concerts seem high to you, have
you recently spent $5 or more
on an album, another media
event, or dinner? I want to make
it especially clear that no one
will be questioned or turned

Dealing with
Money and Class

By Joya Beattie

Where do I begin? I have
never worked in groups before
(except group therapy). It was
not easy (nor was group therapy
for that matter).

While being a part of
Musical Midwives I came in close
contact with some women less
financially fortunate than I. We
discussed money issues in depth
and class issues and I listened to
them talk amongst each other.
We all did not find it easy. We
are at such different places in
our lives and lifestyles.

I consider myself a generous

woman. I wanted to take the
risk that I may lose all that I
initially offered, which was
$1000; although I felt that I
would not lose it all. I saw and

heard Alive! in Michigan this
past summer and enjoyed them
immensely. I knew I would
enjoy them again and I knew so
many others here in Burlington
would also. This seemed impor-
tant to me... to be a part of
contributing happiness and joy
to others. I have a difficult time
accepting compliments and
receiving recognition. I was
unsure in the beginning as to
whether I wanted it to be known
of my generosity. I know now
that I wish it to be known.

We, Musical Midwives, all
put ourselves out tremendously.
I did it more so in a different
way than the others. I did so
financially and with my posses-
sions and time. The others did so
in the way of total energy, time

and spiritually. Where does one
place priorities? Time put in
or money put in? This was
difficult for us all to decide. I
can afford to lose some money.
But what of the others? Should
their time be equated with
money? I, personally, did not
see this as a job. I looked at it
from the beginning as something
fun although after the first week
or so went by it became time
consuming with all that had to
be done to put on a concert. We
all took the risk from the
beginning that we might not be
reimbursed for our services or
our money.

I put in my time in various
ways which is mostly different
from the others. I had a car and
lots of time on my hands. I
drove to Waitsfield, Middlebury,
Stowe, Winooski, Essex Junction
and Shelburne. I did not request
to be reimbursed for gas mileage
or wear and tear on my car, nor
to be reimbursed for my time.

I loaned out my car for
three days and asked nothing in
return.

There was something I
struggled with for three weeks.
Even though I knew that this
was something that I wanted to
be involved with, I found myself
always questioning and looking
for reassurances. Since I have
never worked with the women
of Musical Midwives I found
myself at times slipping into old
patterns of feeling used. These
feelings have been so deep-
rooted in my past that I had to
learn to trust myself in my
decision as well as these women.

RESPONSE

By Sandy Dwyer, Donna Gordon
Jan Shafer, Blue Walker
(The following was written

in response to Joya Beattie’s
article, “Dealing with Money
and Class,” and was submitted
to Commonwoman with Joya’s
knowledge. We hope these arti-
cles stimulate a community-wide
dialogue on class issues. Com-
monwoman welcomes articles on
this topic.)

The process of working on
class issues in Musical Midwives
brought out many questions and
tensions in us (Donna and
Sandy). We started sharing our
thoughts and feelings with
friends. After much sporadic
dialogue we started forming an
analysis of the class situation.
Then we read the article written
by Joya and felt compelled to
write a response. This response is
not meant as a personal con-
frontation, but rather as a means
to spur further dialogue.

There were certain words or
phrases in Joya’s article which
triggered reaction in each of us.
We focused somewhat on these
words as a format for the article.

The system of economics in
this country promotes the idea
that anyone can “make it;” with
good luck and a good idea
anyone can rise above the class
they were born into. This is a
myth which is used by the rich
to justify their wealth and to
keep poor people feeling respon-
sible for their poverty. It also
keeps people in the competitive
struggle, always thinking maybe
they will be the one to “make
it.”

It is true that one is either
“fortunate” or “unfortunate” as
to what class one is born into.
But as adults we have a respon-
sibility to form some under-
standing which is beyond the
realm of luck. It is important to
remember that no one comes
across large sums of money
innocently in this system.
Although money acquired
through an inheritance is in-
direct, it is still money coming
from the sweat and blood of
workers and therefore belongs to
them.

Could I trust them without even
knowing them? They were ex-
tremely supportive of me and
continually checked out with me
to be sure I felt okay about what
I was doing.

I felt that if it were to be
known that I was “well off”
financially in this community
that I would immediately be
disliked. That would upset me a
great deal because I think of
myself as a wonderful woman,
although many times I do not
believe it. I would not want
money to get in the way of
friendships. A friendship is much
more valuable and I cherish
them more than that green stuff.

I have a difficult time
discussing the topic of money,
therefore I rarely do. The money
came through an inheritance, I
did not earn it by working at a
job. It is not easy to justify
receiving money as a result of
someone’s death. A great deal of
guilt is felt.

Right now I am not feeling
that others are more deserving of
it than I and that is something
new for me to feel. I am not
responsible for others being less
fortunate than I. That statement
is a heavy one for me to make
publicly. The situation I am in is
one that happened without my
control. Others have had differ-
ent life experiences. I am ex-
tremely open to my attitudes
changing. They may or they may
not. Only time will tell. I have
the control now and I can
choose to do with my life as I
wish. I feel that I have already
taken a positive step by being
associated with Musical Mid-
wives.

Thank you Musical Mid-
wives for all that I have learned
while being associated with you.
I cherish the experience and
know that I have grown from it
and that is what is most impor-
tant to me.

Although the kind of lifestyle
we each live is to some
extent a matter of choice, there
are unchosen limits for people
without money. Joya’s article
implies that our lifestyles are
totally a matter of choice. We
object to that myth. It is an-
other attitude which perpetuates
the oppression of all people
without economic privilege.

Giving special recognition to
the one womyn who financially
backed the concert brings up
resentment. We see giving special
recognition to the person who
offered money as a way of
devaluing the time, energy, and
love given by the other wimyn in
Musical Midwives. This estab-
lishes a system of the people
who provide the money for a
project as the “investors” and
the people who put out the
energy for a project as merely
the “workers.” Because the
capital doesn’t reap profit, the
