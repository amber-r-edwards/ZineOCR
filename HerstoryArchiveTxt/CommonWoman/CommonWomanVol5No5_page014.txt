beet  

which is disturbing to me.  

t have been a paid worker  
on the festival, mostly as a  
carpenter but all of the workers  
end up doing lots of different  
things, for 3 years. I loved the  
work, and I, like Barbara,  
celebrate what a special and  
wonderful event this woman  
gathering is. But as someone  
working within the coordinator  
structure I have grown increas-  
ingly mistrusting and upset with  
some of the power dynamics and  
financial realities.  

The biggest thing is that the  
festival is not produced, as the  
literature wrongly implies, by a  
collective. Two women, sisters,  
produce the event, hire the  
workers and performers, make  
the major decisions (performers,  
budget, advertising) and basi-  
cally own the assets of the  
festival. After last year’s (‘80)  
festival many coordinators met  
and shared our concerns about  
accountability and responsive-  
ness to the general women’s  
community. We formed a group,  
called the Fine Tuners, which  
consisted of five women whose  
job (mostly volunteer) was to  
solicit ideas and feedback on  
many issues from the other  
workers and our communities at  
home. This group worked on the  
issues and needs raised in the  
statement read from the stage  
and hence, the festival improve-  
ments mentioned in Barbara’s  
article. We also decided that  
WWTMC needed to be honest  
with women, to not call itself a  
collective anymore. The sisters  
formed a partnership (unbe-  
knownst to any of us beforehand),  
legally putting the festival  
assets in their names, yet the  
1981 publicity continued to say  
We Want The Music Collective.  

I am not writing any of this  
out of personal anger so much as  
from an uncomfortable place of  
knowing things I think all  
women who attend or care  
about the festival should know.  
I do not want the festival to  
become less of a special place;  
I just want to see things open and  
clear. For two years now the  
larger Coordinator group has said  
we need to write an update  
statement for the “feminist  
press.” But it hasn’t happened,  
so I’ll write this small attempt  
for Commonwoman,  

Ticket money is the primary  
source of income. That pays for  
80+ workers, for food, supplies  
for all of the various areas,  
performer salaries, sound, lights  
and equipment rental, utilities,  
land rental and a yearly salary  
for the two producers (who  
work most of the year in some  
capacity on the festival). There  
are also office supplies, phone  
and printing costs, etc. Although  
we have made attempts at  
spreading out the financial infor-  
mation and decisions, it remains  
that the two sisters basically are  

If it is to be purchased,  
and this is a high priority project  
as the festival has clearly out-  
grown the land we rent each  
year, it will, at least so far,  
belong to WWTMC. WWTMC  
legally is now a partnership. The  
land committee, with the two  
sisters, is trying now to work out  

legal and fair ways of deciding  

and deeding ownership of this  
land. No one feels okay with it  
simply belonging to WWTMC.  
But it is an issue, a difficult one  
to figure.  

The power dynamics are  
much more specific and intri-  
cate, but for me they mainly  
revolve around prioritizing ex-  
penses and focus at the fes-  
tival. What is extravagant and  

what is okay comforts for  
workers or performers, how  
“political” should the night  
stage be, how many paid  

workers should be in which areas  
are some of my concerns that I  

would like to see more than the  

two, or occasional handful, of  

The  
think  
should be more open, at least  

women have  
finances  

input on.  
in general  

among the workers so we know  
what kind of a budget frame-  
work we're working in. I think  
we could have more input on  
priorities if we knew how much  

the projected budget was, and  

projected money intake.  

This all points toward a  
more cooperative (I think trying  
to do such a large scale event as  
a collective isn’t realistic), group-  
focused structure. Only some of  
the coordinators are strongly  
wanting the festival to move this  
way. Others are basically con-  
tent with the majority of infor-  
mation and decisions resting  
with the two partners. I don’t  
think an event for 8,000 women  
can be most accountably and  
efficiently produced by basically  
two people. I also have strong  
feelings that the money input

and output needs to be more  
open and dealt with by a small  
group rather than the two  
“owners.” There are parts of me  
that feel like that money, and in  
the future that land, belong to  
all of the women who go to, and  
therefore create, the festival.  
I am fine with the workers being  
paid, and the producers receiving  
a good yearly salary. Beyond  
that I think some kind of board  
or group of women should  
manage the assets.  

All of these are subjects of  
discussion, argument and, cur-  
rently, mistrust among some of  
the coordinators. Perhaps the  
current core group will in fact  
write an update for the press. In  
the meantime, I hope this info is  
interesting to those who have  
wanted to know more.
