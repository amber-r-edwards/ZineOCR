Why do we need more  
missiles? We are depleting our  
natural resources, polluting the  
earth, exposing workers to can-  
cerous materials, pouring toxic  
fumes and chemicals into the  
sky and water. In England, the  
decision to deploy U.S. missiles  
there was made by four men in a  
closed meeting; the issue has  
never been allowed to come up  
for vote by the whole Parlia-  
ment. In Germany, 70% of the  
people are against the missiles.  
Sen. Leahy, along with several  
others, is asking President Rea-  
gan to delay deployment for six  
months so that we may have a  
chance to work things out in  
negotiations. More than this,  
they need to stop the produc-  
tion of the missiles altogether.  
Every day, five more missiles are  
made.  

Frankly, I think there are  
huge payoffs being made. Are  
we so naive as not to think that  
there are men who are so power-  
hungry, so greedy that they  
would gamble with other peo-  
ple’s lives? Especially when all  
these men are involved. Presi-  
dent Reagan, Caspar Weinberger,  
Kissinger, George Shultz, and  
the presidents and board mem-  
bers of GE, Westinghouse, Gen-  
eral Dynamics, all belong to an  
all-male ruling elite club, the  
Bohemian Club, which is pre-  
dominantly rich, white, Chris-  
tian men. They meet for three  
weeks every summer for a  
retreat in a virgin redwood forest  
which they own in Northern  
California, and one of the first  
events is the cremation of care.  
(According to the book  
Retreats), a procession of men in  
red hoods and robes takes an  
effigy of “care” to an owl-  
shaped shrine and sets it on fire  
with the torch of Brotherhood.  
They burn up their cares so they  
can “relax” and listen to  
talks such as “The Rearming of  
America” by Caspar Weinberger.  

I think of how the cruise  
and Pershing missiles have been  
referred to as bargaining chips  
and I am angry and terrified that  
our lives are being gambled, that  
the existence of the world is  
being risked for the profit of  
predominantly rich white men,  
to protect our foreign interests  
from communism, because if  
these Third World countries  
became communist, the people  
there couldn't be exploited by  
the multinational corporations  
based in this country.  

CREATIVE HYSTERIA  

However, I don’t think that  
communism is the answer either.  
Most communist countries, the  
Soviet Union in particular, want  
blind allegiance to a technologi-  
cal State. I believe in self-  
determination for the native  
peoples of Central and South  
America. The U.S. government  
should help with the redistribu-  
tion of land, education, etc., and  
stop trying to impose white  
people’s values on native  
peoples for less than minimum  
wage in poor working conditions  
so that Americans can poison  
themselves with coffee and sugar  
while native peoples are poi-  
soned somewhat more quickly  
with the chemicals that are  
sprayed on the crops. (I cringe at  
the thought of all the chemicals  
on the coffee and that the jangly  
feeling from coffee is more from  
the insecticides than the sugar  
from Gen. Mills and Gen. Foods,  
those notorious poisoners of  
children through Captain  
Crunch, Strawberry Pebbles, ad  
nauseam. Sugar and caffeine  
delete the nervous system and  
deaden feelings. Is this how the  
ruling elite has paralyzed us so  
that we carry on business as  
usual while five nuclear weapons  
are built each day, using up  
irreplaceable resources, energy,  
money, exposing the people who  
make them to cancer-producing  
materials, polluting the earth  
with toxic chemicals; this same  
ruling elite is allowing its  
buddies to produce toxic fumes  
which are destroying the ponds  
and lakes of Vermont. So that  
the people who own these  
companies can make a vast  
profit; so that they can “reinvest  
in America? NO.” Most of these  
companies (multinational) rein-  
vest 50 percent of their profit in  
foreign countries, such as in  
computer chips made in Third  
World countries — again, cheap  
labor and poor working condi-  
tions. Mostly women who are  
housed in dormitories. When  
their eyes give out in a few  
years, they have no insurance  
and no future except perhaps as  
a prostitute.  

Which brings me to another  
connection... Wilhelm Reich  
once said that if you want to get  
control over a group of people,  
take control of their sexuality.  
The pornography industry is  
larger than the film and record  
industries combined. (from  
“Pornography — Men Possessing  
Women” by Andrea Dworkin).  
Whoa — you may say — how did  
she get from missiles to porno-  
graphy? Well, here’s another  
connection — Just before the  
rise of Nazi Germany, Germany  
and Poland were flooded with  
pornography. It had a very  
subtle pacifying effect. First,  
people became more isolated  
from one another, off in their  
own fantasy world, second, and  
perhaps more importantly, it  
portrayed women, a certain  
group of people, as objects;  
as “other.” Once a mind makes  
that change in perception, that a  
certain segment of society can  
be used, is considered ‘other’  
then it is easier for them to take  
that segment of society to be  
used or disposed of for the  
“greater good,” or “well-being”  
of the dominant group.  

War and rape go hand in  
hand. Someone told me they  
heard a group of Norwich cadets  
doing morning exercises while  
chanting ‘Rape, pillage, plunder  
and kill.” In Armed Forces  
training, men are egged on with  
comments like — ‘What's the  
matter, you a girl?’ “Hey  
pussy,” etc., as if that is the  
most despicable thing to be.  
Along with pornography, take a  
look at TV and advertising. Both  
would lead one to think that the  
most important thing in life is  
getting rich and getting a man.  
Women’s bodies are used to sell  
everything from cigarettes to  
tires. Then let’s look at the  
financial prospects of women —  
we still get paid 59 percent of  
what a man would get paid, and  
then think again before you say,  
“well those women wouldn’t  
do it if they didn’t want to.”  

So, it seems that the govern-  
ment, the culture, the society,  
has an economic stranglehold on  
women, to “keep them in their  
place.” We are a powerful  
workforce, if we act in solidar-  
ity. These are critical times, this  
means critical actions. What the  
patriarchal capitalist structure  
relates to is money. So don't  
give it to them. We must refuse  
to pay for war and for products  
that pollute the earth. To be a  
war tax resister means you  
refuse to pay the portion of the  
federal budget that is used for  
war... 50-60 percent, which  
could rise to as much as 78.8  
percent under Reagan’s plan to  
fund the Pentagon to the tune of  
one trillion dollars!! in the next  
five years. Contact your local  
peace group for more info.

pamphlet on women as war tax  
resisters from The War Resisters  
League/W. Program on Femi-  
nism and Non-Violence, 85 Carl  
St. S.F. CA 94117.  

And support Sonia Johnson,  
Citizens Party candidate for  
President (maybe she should run  
for co-president with Jesse Jackson?)  

And call and/or write your  
Senators and Congressmen. Each  
postcard, each letter really  
makes a difference when we all  
do it; drop by drop the rock will  
wear away. Actually I think we  
need to smash it with a tidal  
wave. Turn it into sand where  
we can dance and play drums  
and recreate life. Let’s use our  
money and knowledge and crea-  
tivity on real solutions, ecologi-  
cal solutions.  

Do I sound hysterical? Well  
I am. Hysteria comes from a  
Greek root meaning “womb  
sorrow.” And I am full of  
sorrow for the earth and her  
native peoples who are being  
poisoned, raped, tortured, and  
murdered every day.

Terrorizing Honduras  

During our first evening in  
Tegucigalpa we met with repre-  
sentatives, all of whom were  
women, from the Comite de  
Familiares de Detenidos y  
Desaparecidos en Honduras  
(Committee of Families of the  
Detained and Disappeared in  
Honduras). The main speaker, a  
very articulate woman of about  
35 or 40, outlined very graphi-  
cally the present situation in  
their country.  

In greeting, she said, “We  
appreciate that all of you have  
come here to find out about our  
reality. The democracy that they  
say exists in Honduras does not  
exist. The authorities say that  
‘anyone can die happily’ in  
Honduras but that is not true.  

We are glad that you are here to  
study the situation and tell the  
world about it. You must please  
tell the people of the United  
States because the reality is that  
the person who influences this  
country is Reagan. You must get  
him to do something.”  

She spoke very movingly  
about the people who have been  
arrested and detained by the  
Honduran police and have not  
been seen by their families  
and friends since they were  
taken away. The term “desapar-  
ecidos” is used because they  
cannot be found among the  
living or among the dead. Seated  
with the speaker were three  
other women who were, as was  
she, relatives of a young medical  
student. His mother told us in a  
quiet, sad voice that he had been  
missing for a year and would be,  
or would have been 25 in  
August. At the time that he had  
been taken away, he was attend-  
ing school, working to help  
support his family, and was  
secretary of the University  
Federation of Students. She  
said, her voice breaking, that he  
was not involved in terrorist  
activities as the police claimed.  
The family felt that the reason  
he had been arrested was that he  
had been teaching peasants to  
read and write under an extra-  
curricular program funded by  
the Agency for International  
Development. “His crime,” said  
his aunt, “was that he wanted a  
better destiny for the people of  
Honduras.”  

The disappeared constitute  
a new phenomenon for Hon-  
duras, unlike El Salvador and  
Guatemala where there are hun-  
dreds. The student’s aunt  
believes that there are more than  
the fifty their organization  
knows about because many  
families are understandably  
afraid to report missing relatives.  
“Honduras,” she said, “is con-  
sidered to be democratic and if  
there is one disappeared then  
that is a problem for a democra-  
tic country.” All the Honduran  
desaparecidos share a common  
bond. They were all prominent  
in popular organizations of the  
sort her nephew helped lead.  

She listed the social prob-  
lems Hondurans face in efforts  
to change their living conditions:  
hunger (90% of the children  
under five are malnourished),  
alcoholism, lack of housing, lack  
of adequate education (43% of  
the population are illiterate),  
unemployment (60%), begging  
in the streets on the part of  
children as well as adults, and  
administrative corruption. “Our  
children are still waiting for  
milk” because international  
donations have been “poorly  
utilized and poorly channeled.”  

Maintaining that “Honduras  
is now becoming a platform for  
counterrevolution,” she said that  
it was Reagan who had decided  
that their country would have  
that role. (Indeed, that morning  
at the U.S. Embassy, Chris  
Arcos, U.S. Consul for Public  
Affairs, had spoken of Honduras
