Indoctrination

have agreed to the rules of the
game? Even though we had no
say in their making.

It angers me and isolates me
to see other womyn in medicine
annihilating and submerging

their real selves to become
doctors. They believe that they
want what men have. They even
believe that they will get it if
they pass all the exams. They
ignore the reality that womyn’s
mobility in the hierarchy of
medicine has declined in the past
five years. They ignore a special
lecture on the suppressed history
of the golden age of womyn in
medicine in the late 19th cen-
tury. They shun by and large the
support system set up by Paula
Taylor.

One of the characteristics of
people who go into medicine,
and probably especially true for
womyn, is a sense of indivi-
duality. Womyn have struggled
through the cultural opposition
as well as the competitive
pre-med grind to get here. They
don't see the need for bonding
with other womyn in their
profession. If they have prob-
lems working with other stu-
dents, residents or faculty, they
tend to see it as their problem,
an isolated incident. The system
promotes that kind of reasoning.
Without bonding and sharing our
realities, womyn will continue to
think that they can’t cope as

well as they should. They won't
realize that the problem arises
from a conflict between an
institution that supports anti-
female thinking and our own
submerged female selves.

To me it's discouraging. I
feel the backlash coming as it
came in 1910-1914 for womyn
in medicine. We have made little
progress in changing the nature
of the practice of medicine in
the 100 years that we have been
a part of this institution. We
have simply struggled to be
allowed by the men to be like
them.

What can I do about it?
How long can I stand to be the
lone Hag? How can I preserve
and increase my gynergy in their
world? The strong womyn’s
community, a few close friends
here in Burlington have kept me
going with reality checks and
positive criticism of my goals.
There are other Hags up on the
hill and when we have been able
to connect, that too has been
gynergizing. Without such a
network, I fear I would have
become lethally contaminated
by the germs of the patriarchy.
Thank you, sisters.

comment that although she was
named Patricia in honor of her
mother’s birthday, March 17,
the irony of its etymological
connection to the word patriar-
chy does not escape her. She
denies all that which is patrician
and not a part of her real Self.

Scuba Diving
Is For Women

Surprised? Many women enjoy scuba
diving. In fact, 20% of the divers certi-
fied by the National Association of
Underwater Instructors are female. Many
women are active NAUI Instructors also.

Photography, feeding fish, shell collect-
ing, spearfishing and underwater sight-
seeing are parts of the scuba adventure.

Visit our facility to sign up for scuba
lessons. We believe women make great
divers.
