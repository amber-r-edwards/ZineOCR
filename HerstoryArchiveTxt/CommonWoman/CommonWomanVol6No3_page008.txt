By S. Linda Merets

I was born in 1947 in a  
small town in N.J.; grew up in an  
upper middle class home there,  
where, I recall, not one intelli-  
gent conversation any deeper  
than the quality of the roast ever  
occurred. I was, to use Jack  
Kerouac's phrase, the first crazy  
person I knew; a loner who  
spent more time wondering and  
wandering and pondering life in  
general than playing or socializ-  
ing. I was raised, in a subtle way,  
to be independent; so subtle, in  
fact, that my father was  
astounded when I declared total  
independence and moved to  
Hawaii at the age of nineteen.

I have never in this life been  
militant or an activist. I was  
liberated before the 20th C.  
women's movement got up  
steam, and although I support it,  
I have never directly worked for  
it. I participated in anti-Vietnam  
marches in D.C. but I never  
knew why; I felt it, but I had no  
factual reasons to back up those  
feelings and subsequent protests.  
I spent the first 34 years of my  
life, like an infant fascinated by  
his own fingers and toes, on an  
inward keel — but I’ve changed.  
I AM PISSED.

Knowing who I am and  
what my needs are has opened  
me up to the true business of my  
life — fighting to raise the  
consciousness of our race:  
women, children, and men —  
that we may be aware of the  
tyranny and destruction being  
perpetrated on the earth by  
those few fat cats in power; that  
we may save this planet.

I attended the first CISPES  
El Salvador demonstration here  
in Burlington in February, and  
although the organization was  
very pleased with the number of  
people who turned out on that  
wintry day — I was surprised. In  
a city of 38,000 with an addi-  
tional college population of  
about 13,000, I thought a few  
hundred wasn't very many.

I was equally surprised  
when one of my roommates,  
who had to leave early to go to  
work, related this story: Two  
coeds were standing on the  
corner near Finbars. They  
noticed the demonstrators  
beginning to line up at the foot  
of Church Street. One turned to  
the other and said, “Hey, what's  
going on up there?” “Oh,”  
replied the second, “that has  
something to do with Solidarity  
I think.” “Solidarity?” queried  
the first. “Yeah, you know —  
that’s what’s going on in  
Poland.” Mother of God! What  
happened to our education sys-  
tem?

I came away from that rally  
with some added ammunition: it  
gave me the knowledge of and a  
stronger distaste for what's  
really going on in Central  
America. I had begun to read all  
I could find on the subject —  
and really had to search through  
articles to even get a glimmer of  
the reasons for our involvement  
there. There were lots of state-  
ments about the threat of  
Communist control of El Salva-  
dor; its proximity to the Pana-  
ma Canal (which we must  
continue to reign over since we'll  
need it in World War III); the  
famous Domino Theory and the  
unstable conditions of surround-  
ing countries. But in all except  
one article I’d read previous to  
the Burlington rally not one  
word was said about our econo-  
mic interests there: the fact that  
large International companies,  
such as those controlled by the  
Rockefeller empire, make big  
bucks by ripping off the pea-  
sants of El Salvador. And that  
since Big Business not only  
controls banks, research, learn-  
ing institutions and the media,  
but also controls our govern-  

ment, of course Uncle Sam will  
assist the murderous Duarte. The  
present government of El Salva-  
dor apparently is quite friendly  
with Exxon, Texas Instruments,  
and other American-based cor-  
porations there.

My years in grammar school  
in New Jersey killed my desire  
to learn in institutions. This was  
partially due to the repetitive  
nature of the courses, most  
notably American History. It  
seemed that year after year we'd  
study about Columbus, the New  

World, the Pilgrims, Paul  
Revere’s Ride and the Boston  
Tea Party. Well, we've become  
aware in recent years that our  
history books may have told the  
shaded truth, but seldom the  
whole truth. What are the  
history books our schools use  
today? I don’t know — but I'll  
find out (perhaps my next  
literary venture should be to  
rewrite those grammar school  
history texts). The most unfor-  
tunate result of the history book  
propaganda is that today the  
majority of our populace  
believes that the current govern-  
ment is a benevolent protector,  
grown out of the morality and  
evolved from and continuing the  
proud spirit of our forefathers  
who struggled in that most noble  
of revolutions. Horse pucky.  
Abe's address should be revised,  
for ours is a government of the  
rich people, by the rich people,  
and for the rich people.

I wanted to be in Washing-  
ton, D.C. on Saturday, March  
27th. Unfortunately I work  
second shift at one of our local  
Big Brother Corporations (He is  
watching). (I was forced, eco-  
nomically, to take this position  
— my job history lies in a field  
which is currently hibernating.  
I was unemployed for five  

wonderful, though poor  
months). On approaching a  
manager to rearrange my hours  
in order to be on the 7:00 p.m.  
CISPES bus to D.C. Friday  
night, I was told — no, it is not  
the company’s policy to allow  
employees to work hours other  
than those regularly scheduled.  
This, it turns out, was a lie; my  
co-workers told me it is done all  

the time. I, of course, should  
have called in sick — but I  
am not schooled in Corporate-  
game-playing, nor am I any good  
at telling lies (an unfortunate  
flaw in my character). So, I  
decided to go to the Montpelier  
CISPES rally, which actually  
turned out to be a blessing; I was  
able to stay that night and  
experience the Paul Winter Con-  
sort.

Well, I won’t go into the  
actual rally, as I hope someone  
else will cover that for Com-  
monwoman, I will say it was:  
touching, depressing, exciting,  
educational and faith-inspiring  
all wrapped up in one.

But I couldn’t help but  
make some observations about  
our illustrious local daily news-  
paper. Coverage of the early,  
Burlington CISPES rally was  
minimal. Then, not one men-  
tion, that I saw, was made in  
that publication about the plan-  
ned D.C. bus trip or Washington  
rally until Saturday morning,  
well after the buses had left and  
when it was too late for people  
to make the 13 hours drive. Isn’t  
this newsworthy? The first  
major anti-war demonstration in  
our nation’s capital in a decade?  
The Sunday article covering the  
Montpelier rally left me with the  
distinct impression that its  
author only stayed for the first  
speaker or two — put in an  
appearance, spit out an incom-  
plete article, earned her daily  
bread, and obviously didn’t care  

about or understand its meaning.  
And, again, the article in the  
same paper about the Washing-  
ton gathering was minimal. The  
current strength of the Resis-

tance is monumental, compared  
to the early movement twenty  
years ago; but apparently our  
local daily considers it of no  
interest to the citizens of Ver-  
mont.

While at the Montpelier  
gathering, I picked up some  
pamphlets entitled “Nuclear War  
in Vermont” which have some  
startling insights into the Nuke  
situation. I gave one to a woman  
who works on the line with me.  
When a certain technician in our  
department saw her with it, he  
asked where it came from; she  
was thoughtful enough not to  
mention my name (Big Brother  
might not approve of my distri-  
buting information). The tech  
then began a conversation in  
which he allegedly said the  
following (as told to me by the  
woman he said it to): The only  
reason the U.S. is involved in El  
Salvador is so that when we have  
a war with Russia those people  
will help us fight! Abbie Hoff-  
man was right: there’s no way  
we can infiltrate the big corpora-  
tions.

I believe the United States is  
neither admired nor liked by any  
other country in the world; a  
few play the political games, use  
us as we use them, and call  
themselves allies. World statistics  
indicate that our standard of  
living has dropped markedly,  
and yet we continue to strut  
around, proud as a peacock,  
acting like the great white hope.  
Our own people suffer, are  
unemployed, struggle to merely  
survive, while we send billions of  
dollars in social and military aid  
— that is, bribes — to anyone  
whose resources can be bought.  
Unfortunately, this usually  
means countries like El Salvador,  
which are so impoverished that  
they have no choice or hope  
other than to allow Uncle Sam’s  
control.

If we, as citizens of the  
world, continue to lie back and  
allow the corrupt and greedy  
and immoral few to rape this  
globe, to prey on us — then  
we are doomed. What is it some  
policeman advise us to do when  
threatened by a rapist? Lie back  
and enjoy it? With every pump  
of the oil drill and every plunge  
of the pistons of Big Brother's  
machines, we are getting fucked.  
And, Baby, I think we've had  
enough.

Womens Weekend sis  
Sa eerce Ga new kitchens brought us from “Tupperware” to “Anywhere.”  
The nitrogen ratio in composting, was a backdrop to Gloria talking  
We had a great lunch with  

it in the days of Northwood  
Campus and Cate Farm, is dead.  
But the Institute for Social  
Ecology lives on. They recently  
sponsored a weekend for women  
in Plainfield, and this event  
proves that life still exists in the  
concept of social ecology.

The weekend opened at  
Plainfield Community Center  
with some German Chocolate  
Cake and sticky buns from  
Rainbow. Sweets. Also theatre: a  
game-show called “Name Your  
Oppressor” depended on audi-  
ence participation and a chang-  
ing view of women in their  

perceptions.

This gathering was followed  
by morning workshops. I was  
torn between Tax Resistance  
and Permaculture but ended up  
going to the latter since it was  
being given by two former  
housemates of mine. We walked  
through Plainfield to a woman's  
apartment. CarolLee (Carrot)  
showed some slides of women  
working in the fields at Johnny’s  
Selected Seeds in Maine. She  
included a whole array of  
gardening practices: French  
Intensive, companion planting,  
planting by the moon, carbon/  

cover cropping, green manures,  
mulching, special harvesting  
techniques, etc., always with the  
focus on women and agriculture.  
Carrot showed some beautiful  
landscapes and told tales based  
on solid agricultural principles,  
but I felt like a very liberal  
low-level feminist consciousness  
pervaded her talk, making more  
than just myself a little restless. I  
love Carrot, so we took time to  
talk about it later.

The workshop moved out-  
doors to the rec-field by the  
Winooski River. The river was  
high and the sound of the water  

about permaculture. She listed  
the elements earth, air, water  
and fire, and spoke of their  
interaction in an almost lyrical  
way, even though she included  
such specifics as earthworms,  
windbreaks, dowsing and passive  
solar. The basic anarchist princi-  

ples of diversity, spontaneity and  
no-hierarchy were used through-  
out as a way of observing and  
relating to the earth. Hence  
“social” ecology, A good work-  
shop, and we played on the  
swings before returning to the  
Center.

tabouli, humus, three kinds of  
bread and miso soup. I ate with  
a group of women on a fallen log  
in the cemetery. The weather  
was overcast, but warm.

In the afternoon I was again  
undecided about which work-  
shop to go to; the choice for me  
was Lesbianism as Personal Em-  
powerment or Media as Appro-  
priate Technology. I again opted  
for the second because a friend  
was doing it... and soon it was  
agreed upon to somehow com-  
bine the two workshops. An
