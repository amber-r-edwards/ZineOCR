Our

Times Square

By Sondra Corry

Five thousand women
marched in a demonstration
against pornography through

New York's Times Square on
October 20, charging that porno-
graphy contributes to violence
against women. Led by feminists
Susan Brownmiller, Gloria Stein-
em, Diana Russell, Andrea
Dworkin, Robin Morgan and
former New York Congress-
woman Bella Abzug, the demon-
strators followed a route that led

from Columbus Circle, along
Broadway, through Times
Square, along 42nd Street,

covering the heart of the porn
district, and ending in a rally in
Bryant Park behind the New
York Public Library. Accom-
panied by the beat of a bass
drum, the marchers chanted
such slogans as “End the vio-
lence, and the fear, get porno-
graphy out of here,” and
“2-4-6-8, pornography is wom-
an-hate.”

Washington March

Women came from Alaska,
California, from Minneapolis,
Ottawa, Pittsburgh, Rochester,
from North Carolina and New
England and from Washington
D.C. Several hundred men also
marched, some with signs read-
ing “Filmmakers against porno-
graphy” and “Civil Libertarians
against pornography.” Represen-
tatives from the Amalgamated
Clothing Workers carried a ban-
ner; there were Nurses Against
Pornography, Gray Panthers,
representatives from the Screen
Actors Guild and many univer-
sity delegations.

Banners carried by marchers
read “Freedom of the press is
not freedom to oppress,” “Break
the cycle of violence,”
“PorNO,” and a poster saying
“Stop Hustler,” with a drawing
of Hustler’s famous meat grinder
cover with the lower half of a
woman going into a meat
grinder, ground flesh emerging
from the grinder.

Rights

The crowd on the sidewalk
along Broadway was mostly
supportive of the demonstrators,
many nodding or waving.
Owners of the theaters on
Broadway supported the march
because the overflow of hard-
core porn into their area from
42nd Street repels tourists and
hurts their business. The mood
changed, however, as the march
moved into the red-light district.
Police protection was especially
heavy as hecklers jeered and
shouted obscenities at the
marchers.

The march was organized by
New York’s Women Against
Pornography, a group with roots
in the Women Against Violence
Against Women movement. The
group operates from a store
front on 9th Avenue and 43rd
Street and has held guided tours
for several months into the sex
shops and live shows in the
neighborhood, because they
believe that if more people were
to take a closer look at porno-
graphy there would be a growing
demand to shut it down. Organi-

zer Lynn Campbell says that the
present focus of the group is to
educate and inform the public,
in a consciousness-raising
approach, believing that legisla-
tive action must come from an
understanding of the nature of
pornography, its anti-woman
message. While the group has
been especially vocal about the
violent aspects of hard-core
pornography which show
women being bound and beaten,
raped and murdered, and the use
of children in pornography, it is
committed to eliminating all
pornography due to the implicit
connection between the dehum-
anization of women and violence
against women. The crowd was
below the group’s early esti-
mates, and organizer Susan
Brownmiller attributed this in
part to the “liberal-left” which,
she says, blackmails women by
warning them that their own
sexually explicit material will
also suffer if there is an attempt
to clamp down on pornography.

At Bryant Park, Amina
Abdur-Rahman spoke of the
“twin poisons of racism and
sexism,” saying that “the porn
merchants are quite democratic:
they have defamed and libeled
and threatened all of us, both
black and white women.”

Charlotte Bunch, lesbian
theorist and editor of Quest, a
feminist political journal, asked,
“What kind of a society is it that
calls love and affection between
two women ‘perverse’ but con-
siders male violence against
women ‘natural’?” WAP orga-
nizer Barbara Hetzel said that the
United States has no room for
women in equal participation in
its institutions, but has lots of
room for women in its sex
parlors.

Bella Abzug tied porno-
graphy into the many issues
affecting women such as poor
women's lack of access to
abortion, the “violence of pover-
ty,” and also to other issues of
violence such as “the developing
militarism to support a peace
treaty known as SALT II.” The

point was made by Abzug, and
by several other speakers, that
women and liberals would not
tolerate racist or homophobic
materials or acts, but that
they have been co-opted into
tolerating pornography because
it is supposed to represent
sexuality, a supposition femin-
ists now question.

Gloria Steinem pointed out
that the movement against por-
nography is becoming an inter-
national movement, referring to
marches which have already
taken place in West Germany
and Canada and growing concern
in other European countries. She
said, “This march is a victory for
every woman whose father,
brother, lover, or husband brings
porn into her home, humiliating
her and ridiculing her when she
protests. It is a victory for every
man here who refuses to be
addicted to society’s norm of
male dominance.” She said that
the porn shops are breaking the
laws, paying off inspectors in
order to stay open; “this
march,” she said, “is not sup-
ported by the Mafia.”

The speech that finally
brought the weary crowd, tired
from four hours of marching and
listening, to its feet in a roar of
approval, was delivered by
Andrea Dworkin, author of
Woman Hating. Dworkin, a
powerful speaker, gave a brilliant
satire of the masochism attri-
buted to women and used to
justify not only pornography
but the many crimes against
women, such as rape, incest,
wife and child abuse. The
following is a partial account of
what Dworkin said that “they”
say about women:

"She wants to be beaten,
she wants to be forced, she
wants to be raped, she wants to
be brutalized, she wants to be
hurt.” The first principle of all
