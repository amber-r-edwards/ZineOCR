Rural Isolation

Rural isolation affects the  
homeworker more than any  
other person because she spends  
more time in the home setting  
than other adults. Rural isola-  
tion is not only characteristic of  
the “back to the earth” group of  
young adults who choose to  
make it in the rural areas of the  
country. For some women, the  
terms “rural isolation” are not  
even part of their vocabulary.  
They take for granted that  
another winter is on the way.

Houlton, Maine, is one of  
the many areas of Northern New  
England which is considered  
“rural isolated.” There are places  
more northerly and surrounding  
areas which on a scale of avail-  
ability outrank Houlton as being  
“in the sticks” but Houlton is  
typical of the many small  
communities in Northern Maine,  
particularly in Aroostook Coun-  
ty, the largest and most expan-  
sive county in the state. To  
residents of the Southern part of  
Maine, THE COUNTY is regard-  
ed as some mystical place where  
only the hardy can survive.

I have spent ten years living  
in this community and have  
always been fascinated by the  
women who work in the home —  

how they cope, their comments  
about women’s roles in rural  
settings and their continuous  
battles with the long winters.  
Two particularly articulate  
young women recently discussed  
with me the many facets of rural  
isolation and its effect on the  
homeworker. They reinforced  
the many conclusions that I had  
come to while living in Houlton.  
They added to my already  
growing list of pleasures and pit-  
falls of life here. Their conclu-  
sions were a repetition of what I  
had heard and shared with other  
women working in the home.

Rural isolation means long  
phone conversations, morning  
screwdrivers, loneliness, survival,  
escapism, newfound inner  
strength, lack of quality child  
care, looking forward to the  
monthly Bookmobile visit, cul-  
tural and educational voids,  
rediscovering public radio and  
T.V., forming co-op play groups,  
enrolling in adult education,  
playing Beano, bowling, Bridge,  
or Belly-dancing.

To Christy Fitzpatrick,  

homeworker, mother, and part-  
ner in the operation of a potato  
farm with her husband, part of  

the problem with women and  
isolation is that “women’s ex-  
pectations are so low around  
here.” She stresses that many  
women are from very traditional  
farm families where the sons did  
the chores outside the home  
while the daughters did the  
“women’s work” of cooking,  
cleaning, and child-caring.

The way things are struc-  
tured here is not encouraging to  
women at all. They’re good for  
picking potatoes, and having  
babies and putting food on the  
table. That's the traditional  
view.  
Another area homeworker,  
Kris Murphy, has this comment  
about roles in the rural setting:  
“Women are mostly dominated  
by men. The community here is  
male-run.”

Isolation can take many  
forms and both women pointed  
to the economy as a reason for  
the lack of exposure to “other”  
ideas, people and possible life-  
styles. Having the economic  

“power” to be able to leave the  

area for short trips was the  
reason many women were able  
to suffer through long periods of  
isolation: “Economy, social life  

and attitudes are wrapped up in  
one big chunk,” Ms. Mur-  
phy said.

The seasons add to the  
impact of isolation on women  
also: “Winter is when there are  
Tupperware parties, Bee-line  
parties, and Rubbermaid par-  
ties,” Christy commented.

She felt that this was a  
curious but real “coping” me-  
chanism for many homeworkers.  
There is a common problem of  
lack of adult contact for many  
women who have small children  
and lack transportation during  
the winter months. In many  
cases, these homeworkers seem  
unable to meet just to visit.  
They need some legitimate ex-  
cuse for indulging in adult  
contact. Ms. Murphy puts it  
this way: “Let’s have a party” is the  
biggest come on around here.  
Kris spoke of her previous  
experiences in the Massachusetts  
and Connecticut areas where  
women met for a drink or lunch  
together just for the enjoyment  
of stimulating conversation. She  
feels there are “no models for  
women” in rural settings. They  
fear stepping out of predescribed  
roles.

Adequate child care has  
always been an issue for the  
homeworker:

So much of women’s work-  
ing energy goes into making sure  
the sitter’s going to be avail-  
able... and the arrangements are  
really temporary.

Christy concludes that  
because of lack of adequate  
child care and limited job  

opportunities, women have little  
to look forward to if they decide  
to work outside the home:  
Going back to work is going  
to be working at McDonald's,  
Woolworth’s, or the glove fac-  

tory. There is a real problem  
with prejudice against women  
who work (outside the home)  
around here. Men feel their jobs  
are being taken by women.

Limited economic potential  
is one of the reasons that Kris  
Murphy and her husband will  
not be permanent residents of  
the area. She wants to pursue an  
interrupted career in art when  
her children reach school age:  
“There is a cultural void here.  
For example, I miss a constantly  
moving art exhibit.”

One of the highlights for  
many of the area homeworkers  
is the annual Potato Harvest in  
the Fall of the year. (Potato  
Harvest is a four week period  
when the schools close so the  
children and adults can help  
with the Harvest.) Christy talks  
of the homeworkers she knows  
who are already organizing their  
babysitting arrangements for the  
Harvest:

That’s when you spend your  
day with adults... even if you  
have to ride on a harvester to  
have other women to talk to...

During Ms. Murphy’s second  
winter here she lived in an  
apartment in Houlton and felt  
even more isolated than where  
she is living now outside of the  
town limits:

I was playing head games  
then. I improved my skills —  
cooking, sewing continuously  
just for something to do.

She said that not being a  
“native” contributed to her  
feelings of isolation. It forced  
her into picking herself up,  
transcending the loneliness and  
finding the potential within  
herself to start reaching out: “If  
you don’t create something for  
yourself, you'll go down the  
tubes.”

Many homeworkers faced  
with rural isolation do go down  
the tubes. There is a high inci-  
dence of alcoholism and depres-  
sion among women especially at  
the peak of the winter. Nancy  
McKay, Aroostook Mental  
Health Office Director in Houl-  
ton, reports that the center’s  
highest intakes occur during  
January, February, and March.  
She theorizes that because of the  
family ties in this part of New  
England the usual high intake of  
the holiday season (December)  
that she has known from metro-  
politan areas is reversed up here.

Women who have tasted  
other flavors of life and women  
who have only known the life  
within a fifty mile radius of  
Houlton all feel the confinement  
and the depression, the coping  
and self-discovery that the long  
winter months bring to a “rural  
isolated” area. Talk with these  
women — these homeworkers.  
They are creative and sharing  
individuals. They cope and sur-  
vive. Some more than others  
have the inventiveness, the ener-  
gy, the economic independence,  
the inner endurance to sift  
through the winter days with  
little outside contact. The sum-  
mer now offers them a reprieve  
from the isolation — just long  
enough to prepare for what  
awaits them on the other side of  
the Harvest.
