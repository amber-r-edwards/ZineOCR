KUDOS! to the office of  
Stephanie Shoggan of the  
Burlington Police Dept., Sex  

Crimes Unit, for her persistent  
efforts which led to the arrest of  
a man now being charged with  
multiple sexual assaults  
occurring throughout the city.  

For the first time in history  
all ‘Seven Sister’ colleges will  
be headed by women. In the  
past, the prestigious Eastern  
schools all had male Presidents,  
but with the inauguration of  

Elizabeth Kennen at Mt.  
Holyoke, on October 7, this  
tradition will be completely  
broken. Barbara Newell,  

President of Wellesley College,  
said, ‘‘There was a certain feeling  
of elation among us that the  
colleges established 100 years  

ago to produce women leaders  
are at last led by women  
leaders!" Mary Patterson  
McPherson, newly elected head  
of Bryn Mawr, called the group  
“the new matriarchy.”  

Laurie Glenn Jacobson was  
nearly 6 months pregnant when  
she was interviewed in August  
while nearing the end of the  
grueling, 21-week officer  
training course at the Quantico  
Marine Corps base. ‘’The baby  
wasn't any problem — I’m just  
so short I had to take twice as  
many steps just to keep up,”  
said the 5-foot Lt. Jacobson,  
who two weeks before had  
marched 20 miles across rugged  
terrain carrying a machine gun  
tripod and 400 rounds of  
ammunition.  

HALLOWEEN  

Continued from  

broomsticks — Walt Disney  
witchery... Witches are written  
into our folklore, our fairytales  
as malevolent and anti-social,  
ugly, heinous. The symbols  
associated with their craft have  
become symbols of ‘danger, of  
bad luck. Many — animals,  
including cats, were associated  
with witches. It is said that the  
Bubonic plague was caused by  
the destruction of many of the  
cats in Europe. Rodents thereby  
went unchecked in spreading  
this plague. This is reminiscent  
of Saint Patrick driving all of the  
snakes out of Ireland. Snakes  
were important and powerful  
symbols in matriarchal culture.  
They were often seen as consorts  
of the Goddess. Destruction of  
snakes is perhaps an allegory  
perhaps a reality about a  
Christian religion overtaking a  
matriarchal one.  

Halloween. A yearly  
celebration which revolves  
around the sale of poisoned  
images and sugar candy.  
Skeletons, black cats, ghosts,  
and hideous ugly witches — their  
significance goes unacknow-  

ledged other than in how these  

Negative images of death and of  
women eat inside of ourselves  
and our children as deep as the  
sweet poison sugar candies sold  
in these same shapes.  

I am a witch. I want to  
reclaim myself. I envision a  
reclamation ritual for Halloween  
in which we women witches  
dress in and then shed these  
cardboard and crepe paper  
costumes that have formulated  
our knowledge of witches, that  
have reinforced hatred and fear  
of women, that have made a  
mockery of the victims of a  
genocide. I envision us shedding  
these costumes down to our bare  
skin and identifying that it is we,  
without costume in our many  
and varied shapes and ages who  

have been, and will again be  
strong, magical, powerful,  
beautiful, witch women.  

And we will burn the  
costumes. One last witch  
burning.

He Would’ve Made a Lousy Father Anyway  

Only eleven hours later when I first saw  
him at lunch at Pierre’s with you when  
he didn’t even know I was there  

in you, maybe then I might have said he  
was all right. But as soon as you told him,  
his attitude changed; so much that he’s  

ended up punishing you for what he ap-  
parently believes you alone have done; but  
remember that he was the one who had come  

over to see you that night. Trust me,  
Mother, mourn less over what you have agreed  
to do to me in light of my poor opinion of him.

The differences in head between  
the sexes, just as those between  
the races,  
mental  

must be reduced to  
differences. It is clear  
enough that the relationship  
between brain and body is not  
the same in the two sexes. A  
normal man, even if he be small,  

needs a head circumference of at  
least 53 centimeters, whereas a  
woman gets along quite well  
with 51 centimeters. Thus, for  
the tasks of a woman’s life, a  
brain that has room within a  
head of 51 centimeters is  
sufficient. But for the tasks of a
