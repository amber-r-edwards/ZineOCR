‘Meg Christian

By Lynn Vera

From August 17-20, a new
town was created near Hesperia,
Michigan. Over six thousand
womyn from all areas of the
U.S. and Canada gathered to live
together for 4 days of sharing:
talking, music, dancing, eating,
working, opening. I went to this,
the second annual “Michigan
womyns’ festival with 14 other
local womyn. I don’t feel like I
went to Michigan — I feel like I
drove a thousand miles and
stopped in a country settlement
of womyn unlike any town or
state in existence anywhere. And
I never wanted to leave.

Picture 200 acres of fields and
forest, buried deep in rural
Michigan. Picture thousands of
colorful tents spread through the
fields and back into the wood
ferns, all connected by
well-trodden paths through the
grass. Imagine the central
community space at the highest
point of the land: a large
information tent with someone
always there to answer questions
and explain directions, a warm
dimly lit spacious tent called
“the womb" where womyn took
turns providing health care, an
outdoor shower rig with 12
heads for cold community
showers in the sunlight, a huge
circle of tables surrounding the
food tents and firepits where
food was cooked and served all
day, a natural hillside
amphitheater encircling the
stage-tent where womyn met
nightly to share and hear music
for hours into the darkness,
stopping to watch the moon rise
up over the trees each night.
Imagine a place where only
womyn walked, where time and
schedules mattered only as much
as you wanted them to, where
womyn’s music was the only
continual sound — no cars or
trucks or sirens, no radios or
televisions or telephones, no
crowded streets or stores, no
fear.

No fear. When I finally
believed (it took a day) that I
could exist amidst that many
people and walk alone with
absolutely no fear of rape,
harassment, objectification,
rip-offs or humiliation, I was

ecstatic. Imagine living for 4
days in total absence of fear. I
have never felt so unobjectified
before — celebrate the joy of
waking up and walking to
breakfast or the bathroom with
no clothes on, or no shirt, past
thousands of people, and feeling
totally relaxed and unafraid: I left my camera, shorts with
money in them, things I had
bought at the womon-seller’s
tent, and my down sleeping bag
on the ground dozens of times
while I went off to dance, or
shower, or swim in the creek, or
play with people — never once
did I fear getting ripped off.

The outstanding impression I
realized was that the energy felt
“attentive.” There were special
camping and bathroom areas for
the physically handicapped,
there were signers for all the
concerts so deaf womyn could
“hear” the words of the music,
there were “emotional healers” in the healthcare tent to sit and
talk and validate any need, the
tickets were on a sliding scale
from $5 to $8 a day, food
included, the children had a
huge childcare tent of their own,
there was eye contact and
talking, and shared campfires,
food and dry clothing. Womyn
volunteered to relieve others on
shifts for cooking, health work,
security, parking and registration
all through the night. I was in
the midst of a very caring
community.

During the 4 days there were
workshops in skill sharing,
music, building — matriarchy,
womyns’ health, racism in
womyns’ communities,
vegetarianism, sexuality,
womyns’ ritual, vocal
improvisation, dealing with
anger, natural healing and
massage, puppeteering,
self-defense, parthenogenesis,
business, alternative childbirth,
anti-Semitism, theater, star
gazing... there were also 3 “jam
tents” equipped with pianos and
sound equipment where womyn
reserved time or simply joined in
and played music all day. There
was always some kind of food
available at the food circle,
always showers to cool off in,

the sellers’ tent to browse
through, new people to talk to,
or wonderful places to lay in the
sun and read, be alone, or spend
quiet time with friends.
Constantly in the background
beat the sound of conga drums.
In a space by a tree close to the
central community area was a
circle of womyn beating conga
drums. All day the sound
continued, and womyn pounded
the ground dancing. The conga
beaters changed often, but the
sound was remarkably steady
and familiar. The feeling was

purely tribal; I felt at home in a
tribe of womyn.

One incredible happening was
THE STORM. The second night,
soon after the music started, a
rainstorm began. With it came
incredibly high winds, huge
cracks of thunder, and lightning
so intense that it appeared bright
as day. The situation became
serious as the huge “big-top”
type tents began to lift,
threatening to leave sound
equipment and merchants’ goods
exposed to ruin by wind and
rain. It was cold and dark and

scary in the high winds and rain
yet hundreds of womyn
(performers alike) stripped and
stood outside holding down the
ropes to the huge tents and
constructing makeshift plastic
walls around the stage. Others
took pick axes and chopped
furiously at the ground, making
drainage ditches for the torrents
of water. Roaming announcers
told us of tornado sightings 20
miles away. I can almost now
picture the amazing sight of
naked, drenched womyn,
bizarrely lit in the lightning
flashes, working furiously in the
chaotic wind and rain. The
storm raged long into the night.
We held each other, chanted,
shared body and dry-clothing
warmth, and took turns holding
down the tents. It was 4 a.m.
before the storm broke.
Hundreds of womyn fell asleep
together under the big tent. The
next afternoon the sun came
out, people helped each other
salvage and dry belongings, a big
truck took hundreds of sleeping
bags to town to dry them, and
the music began again. It was at

this time that we learned we had
weathered the worst area storm
in 36 years; furthermore, the
area had been suffering through a
serious drought. The power of
that many womyn together,
loosing such clear energy as
dancing and music and ritual is,
cracked the heavens wide open
with a fury we are just beginning
to realize is ours.

You may wonder why I write
so much about the place and the
feelings — after all, aren't I
telling you about a MUSIC
festival? Yes, but of a
WOMYNS’ music festival — not
a gathering to watch and hear
star performers (although they
came too), but to watch and
hear each other, to discover and
absorb that incredibly powerful,
unique and open energy that
happens in a womon-only place.
The music was, in fact,
wonderful. The musicians, all
womyn, were varied; some were
well known and others new.
There were 18 different
musicians who shared their
music from the stage... almost all
of these womyn also facilitated
workshops during the day to
share their abilities and to break
down the imposing
performer/audience barrier.
These womyn played in on each
other's sets (concerts) at night,
and during the day invited any
womyn to come and “jam” with
them in the practice tents.
Stardom was consciously given
up by the performers and
broken down by the entire
atmosphere — camping together,
sharing food and showers,
getting help in the healthcare
tent, and attending workshops
together. Among the womyn
giving concerts at night were
Meg Christian and Teresa Trull
(recorded on Olivia records),
Sweet Honey in the Rock (an
intense acapella group of black
womyn from Washington, D.C.),
Sirani Avedis (a political lesbian
womon of color), Jesse Jackson
and her 14 piece womyns band
(in the style of the ‘30s big

Crowd Scene with Velveteen

bands), and Alivel, a jazz
ensemble from San Francisco
whose music resonates with an
awareness of womyns’ spirituality. There were many
others; the musical program was
diverse and strong, and it was
such a joy to hear my politics
celebrated in song, such a relief
from the patriarchal blues of the
“real-world” radio.

It's hard to think of
concluding this article; I want to
go on and on recreating this
most wonderful experience. For
the womyn reading this, hear my
excitement and think about
going to the festival next year.
For me the ultimate thrill of this
festival was that it made my
fantasy a reality. That womyn
could come together and create
a womyn-only community
(imagine the magnification of all
the gentle and loving strength
that is womon), autonomous
and self-supportive, fulfilling all
of each others’ needs for those 4
days, is a real and exciting
encouragement toward my
realization of a long-term,
self-sustaining rural womyns’
community. With shared
responsibilities around food
(growing and preparation),
maintenance, childcare, finances,
wood, cars, and all of the other
headaches we individually spend
so much of our time and energy
on, we would each and
collectively have so much freed
up space in our days to channel
into political work projects
(publications, actions, skill and
knowledge sharing with other
groups, community education,
making films and music, cottage
industry) and community focus.
The Michigan festival was the
experience for me of a large
supportive group of womyn
living in community together.
It's a vision of mine now quickly
moving out of the realm of
fantasy. At Michigan the music
was perhaps the drawing factor,
but it was the community that
formed and the sharing of
womyns’ energy there that made
those 4 days as familiar, warm,
caring and wonderful as they
were.
