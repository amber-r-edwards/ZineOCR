For The  
Man In  

Your Life  

(This tongue-in-cheek exer-  
cise in wish fulfillment is reprint-  
ed from East Bay Men's Centre  
Newsletter and The Periodical  
Lunch, Ann Arbor, Michigan.)  

The newest development in  
male contraception was unveiled  
recently at the American  
Women’s Surgical Symposium  
held at the Ann Arbor Medical  
Centre. Dr. Sophie Merkin, of  
the Merkin Clinic, announced  
the preliminary findings of a  
study conducted on 763 unsus-  
pecting male undergraduate stu-  
dents at a large midwest univer-  
sity. In her report, Dr. Merkin  
stated that the new contracep-  
tive — the IPD — was a break-  
through in male contraception.  
It will be marketed under the  
tradename “Umbrelly.”  

The IPD (intrapenile device)  
resembles a tiny folded umbrella  
which is inserted through the  
head of the penis and pushed  
into the scrotum with a plunger-  
like instrument. Occasionally  
there is perforation of the  
scrotum but this is disregarded  
since it is known that the male  
has few nerve endings in this  
area of his body. The underside  
of the umbrella contains a  
spermicidal jelly, hence the  
name “Umbrelly.”  

Experiments on 1,000 white  
whales from the continental  
shelf (whose sexual apparatus is  
said to be the closest to man’s)  
proved the Umbrelly to be 100%  
effective in preventing produc-  
tion of sperm, and eminently  
satisfactory to the female whale  
since it does not interfere  
with her rutting pleasure.  

Dr. Merkin declared the  
Umbrelly to be statistically safe  
for the human male. She report-  
ed that of the 763 graduate  
students tested with the device  
only two died of scrotal infec-  
tion, only 20 experienced swell-  
ing of the tissues. Three develop-  
ed cancer of the testicles, and 13  
were too depressed to have an  
erection. She stated that com-  
mon complaints ranged from  
cramping and bleeding to acute  
abdominal pain. She emphasized  
that these symptoms were mere-  
ly indications that the man’s  
body had not yet adjusted to the  
device. Hopefully the symptoms  
would disappear within a year.  

One complication caused by  
the IPD and briefly mentioned  
by Dr. Merkin was the incidence  
of massive scrotal infection  
necessitating the surgical remov-  
al of the testicles. “But this is a  
rare case,” said Merkin, “too  
rare to be statistically impor-  
tant.” She and other distinguish-  
ed members of the Women’s  
College of Surgeons agreed that  

the benefits far outweighed the  
risks.  

Mine to Keep  

Another long and tiring day  
I hate the place I stay — 8 hours a day  
I come home to clean and cook and swear  

Then I read to my daughter Kate  
Wander finally to my room.  

Peel myself down to nothing  
Leave all those winter layers where they fall  
Ease my aching body into my empty bed  

Anticipate what lies ahead  
Touch those lips with understanding  
Grit my teeth — scowl and roar  
Splinters of pleasure pierce all over  
Praise the Goddess for my woman core.  

Floating I think of tensions gone  
Is it good to enjoy being alone?  
Drift slowly into silky sleep  
Knowing this pleasure is mine to keep.

LETTERS

aspect of her life miserable. I’m  
sure the same thing is true of the  
other forms of oppression  
described on the page, for the  
women they affect.  

And then you add insult to  
injury by following the “ism’s”  
page with an article entitled  
“ism schism”! The author is  
certainly entitled to her views,  
but she seems to have no em-  
pathy at all. I have to assume  
that she hasn’t suffered from  
any of the specific additional  
forms of oppression (in addition  
to women’s oppression, of  
course, which affects us all), at  
least those described, and thus  
doesn't realize how awful they  
feel. Otherwise, I must conclude  
that she’s really callous. Yes, I  
think we need to work together,  
but transcending our differences  
is not the same thing as pretend-  
ing they don’t matter. A fat  
woman is acutely aware of the  
cultural hatred thin women —  
even feminists — who aren’t  
aware of fat oppression have for  
her.  

I hope you'll take the above  
remarks in the spirit of sisterly  
constructive criticism. I think  

Commonwoman is a really good,  
political, feminist newspaper,  
and I hope you can resolve your  
financial worries and keep on  
publishing. I look forward to  
receiving you in the mail,  

Sincerely,

Respect  

Dear Commonwoman,  

In reading the December  
issue of Commonwoman, I was  
concerned at the self-deprecat-  
ing, albeit somewhat humorous,  
tone of two of the articles: “On  
Being Political” and “The P.C  
‘House Beautiful.’ There is no  
need to take an attitude of  
anything less than complete  
pride in yourselves and the  
Burlington women’s commun-  
ity! I am afraid that even joking  
in this vein allows yourselves and  
others to view you with less  
than total respect. There are  
better ways to laugh.

Isle of Womon  

Time spent in love with life  

Summer days, cool nights  
Starry sky and rainy morn  
Music that drifts everywhere,  
Time to learn, to listen and to talk  
Hills to walk, work to share and  
Food not to compare  

The sight, the feelings are hard  
To share for those who were not there  
How do you tell of magic moments  
When womyn do and care for one another?  
How do you tell of a place that rises like  
An island then disappears again, leaving only  
The hope that it will arise come next year?  
What name do you give it?  

Do you call it a dream, when you know it  
Was real?  

When island is gone and no homeland can be  
found. Does that make it less real?  

The isle of womon  

Womyn and daughters sharing a summer sun  
And lazy night  

With only firelight and starlight to guide  
Their path  

How do you show the peace that it gives, just  
to remember?  

Or tell of the light in the womyn’s eyes you meet  
And sorrow when leaving  

The isle of womon  

A spirit in time where no man enters  

Hope dares you to try to see it all  

To remember and return  

To find a path and stay  

But like all magic moments it ends  

But with parting, it leaves a stronger  

Tie for womyn in your life  

Because you have seen it and felt it  

It cannot be left  

The isle of womon.
