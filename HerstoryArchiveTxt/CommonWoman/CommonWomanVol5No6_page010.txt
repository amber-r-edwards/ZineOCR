a 4

moments in life change

so much and so fast
that I have to wonder if I’m really
cut out for this life.

one moment I'm with friends
loving,
sharing,
and caring

And the next moment
I’m alone,
and crying.
It’s so scary!
I’m afraid of being alone,
and of being myself.
I'm afraid that I'll die of fear.

ay

I don’t want to hate,
but to love.
I don’t want to cry,
but to laugh.
What's holding me back?

+

One moment I'm saying I’m beautiful (inside)

and the next moment

I'm a total opposite
Why?

I want to be free,

not a caged bird
I want to sing,

not to cry “pain.”

My mind aches to know
where I’m going—
and with whom.
Will I ever know?

POETRY

Touching Bottom

Let yourself touch bottom feet first
Go down to where the water is chilling,
and murky

Take your naked wet arms

that you hold to your hips

and thrust them upward

in a different motion.

Force them through the force
of the water and push yourself
deep into the dull darkness
Go to where you pass

the point of panic

below the place of breathing
into the numbing silence.

As you sink

into that nameless density
with open sightless eyes
remember what has driven you.
Stay

Sharpen your pain

until it can cut the water

until you can swivel upward like a sleek fish

turning silver curls
in the clearing water.

No longer circling
just below the surface.

Mind and Body

I used to be mind and body.
Body wanted
and Mind rationalized
the possibility of obtaining.
Now I’m just body!
Body wants
Body needs
Body gets
on impulse
with no thought
involved.
Body wants to be touched
Body needs to be held
Body gets intimacy
from any other body
willing to share
regardless of the
circumstances.
Body,
make friends with Mind
again
so that we can be
whole and
not a fraction
of two different
entities.
