PEAT UIRIES  
Gay Oppression at UVM  

By Vivian A. Catania  

Does the topic of gay rights  
include homosexual women?  
Last spring a male student at the  
University of Vermont aston-  
ished the co-director of the Gay  
Student Union; he menacingly  
told her that, “It doesn’t matter  
if you're a lesbian because there  
is only one hole that a man can  
fill.” On February 8, 1979, the  
university newspaper, the Cynic,  
interviewed several members of  
the Gay Student Union (GSU)  
and then published an article  
which was to represent the  
general gay public. Instead, the  
cartoon on the cover of the issue  
showed an earring-clad, effem-  
inate male stepping out of a  
darkened and eye-filled closet of  
hiding homosexuals. Wilda  
White, the co-director of the  
GSU since the fall of 1978,  
summed this bias up adequately  
during a private interview: “How  
many times do you see women  
in an article about homosexuals?  
I don’t think that they believe  
that women are gay.”  

These examples seem to  
indicate that gay women need to  
unite and be recognized, but  
from the GSU perspective, the  
gay issue mainly involves a  
freedom of sexual choice for  
both men and women. The  
rights of each sex must be  
recognized. But to the UVM  
administration and its president,  
Lattie Coor, the issue of the  
political position of gays and  
their rights may never be openly  
discussed because the adminis-  
tration prefers to be evasive  
concerning their opinions. The  
university is unwilling to support  
a gay rights policy which is so  
badly needed on the campus.  
During the spring semester of  
1978, the GSU submitted a  
proposal for an anti-discrimina-  
tion statement for gay students  
to both the Dean of Students  
and Lattie Coor. This and other  
subsequent attempts to get the  
statement accepted were reject-  
ed.  

Wilda admitted that she was  
gay in 1976, and this difficult  
experience has made her believe  
that pro-gay legislation must be  
adopted by the UVM adminis-  
tration before many gay stu-  
dents will come out. She futilely  
discussed this subject with Coor  
during a meeting which took  
four months to arrange. Many  
homosexual women and men  
find that their gay identity is a  
psychological problem: adminis-  
trative, faculty and peer pres-  
sures have made self-acceptance  
difficult. Said Wilda, “If more  
gay students do not become  
open about their preferences,  
then the heterosexual student  
majority will ignore the issue  
and the gay population will  
remain invisible.  

Apparently, the university  
hopes that if it tries to ignore  
the GSU, then the latter will  
mysteriously disappear. Two  
semesters ago, a tour guide was  
asked by prospective students  
and their parents which organi-  
zation used such and such an  
office in the Billings Student  
Union building. Wilda overheard  
the reply: “That's the Gay  
Student Union office, but they  
have no members.” (Absurd!)  
Some students are not so naive;  
many of the GSU general  
meeting and disco posters have  
been repeatedly ripped down or  
defaced. Last April, the GSU  
billboard which announced the  
Green Mountain Gay Awareness  
Weekend was splashed with  
“NO FAGS IN BURLINGTON”  
in dripping black paint. The  
GSU hotline usually receives an  
average of four derogatory  
phone calls per month, but  
during the week prior to this  
Gay Awareness event, there  
were about twelve somewhat  
obscene calls.  

An anti-discrimination  
policy would not only protect  
the gay students from such peer  
harassment, but it would also  
prompt many professors to be  
more sensitive to the needs of  
their homosexual students too.  

Rather than orient ourselves  
toward martyr-making actions  
which bring on “sacrifice and  
deprivation,” Flo wants to see  
our social struggle directed  
toward “hurting them at least as  
much as they hurt you.”  

“Struggle is frequently ille-  
gal,” she observes ironically, and  
adds, “It's not about winning.  
It’s about surviving, with dig-  
nity. In sum, her motto is,  
“Rag their asses to death.” Flo  
calls her theory of action the  
“testicular approach” — “you  
get into the area that’s so tender,  
they just won't want to take you  
on.”  

One tactic which doesn’t  
work, she says, is waiting until  
you’re on the defensive before  
you fight back. An example she  
gives is a lesbian mother fighting  
for custody of her child, who  
didn't see the need to act on the  
issue until it was a personal  
problem. “She's in a bad way  
now because she waited until  
they were already on her. We  
have to start up before they start  
up. Don’t wait until they’ve got  
your ass in the wringer.” She  
advises, however, that people  
think before they act, consider-  
ing all possible repercussions.  

“Move fairly cautiously. It  
depends on how much you want  
to sacrifice.” With something  
like lesbian mother custody  
rights, she says, “They won't  
give them to you. You're going  
to have to fight for it, and if you  
don’t fight, they can take it back  
any time they want.”

COMMONWOMAN JUNE 1979  

There are many instances of the  
gay student who must suffer  
through the humiliation of a  
professor’s joke at her or his  
expense. In the fall of 1976,  
Wilda’s Sociology 10 professor  
calculated the approximate num-  
ber of people that someone may  
meet, and of that amount, who  
would be eligible for the person  
to marry. Out of 215 million  
then living in the world, approxi-  
mately one half of these people  
would be male and the other  
half female, “but, of course,”  
said the professor, “let's chop  
off for the queers and other  
faggy people.” Another one of  
her professors recited a little  
anecdote about two diplomats  
and their careers: “There was a  
husband and wife team; rumor  
has it that he liked boys and she  
liked girls, but just because  
they're queers, we can’t hold it  
against them.” One of these  
professors later apologized to his  
class for his negligence, but for  
the gay students, the stinging  
acrimony of pain had already  
been felt. One psychology pro-  
fessor was not so kind; concern-  
ing homosexuality, he stressed,  
“It is not an attraction to the  
same sex, but actually it is a fear
