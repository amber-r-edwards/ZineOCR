DIVORCE

Do It Yourself

By Denise Matthews

One day last fall I went to
Bookstacks. It was a brave move.
I didn’t browse or linger. I went
directly to the Women’s Section,
to the top shelf — there was the
object of my midnight terrors, a
thin gold booklet entitled A
Non-Lawyer’s Guide to Getting
a Divorce in Vermont. I knew it
was a do-it-yourself kit, designed

to lead the lay person through
the legal labyrinth from marriage
to divorce.

Like many people going
through divorce, I had been
ambivalent for a long time.

Buying this $5 kit signaled a
decision at last. I brought it
home and it sat very brightly on
my desk for a month or two. I
think that I felt that the act of

buying the kit should have been
enough. The divorce should have
been retroactive from the
moment of purchase, since the
hardest part of the struggle was
over. I had made up my mind.
Of course, society which loved it
so well when I married couldn’t
be satisfied with such a private
conclusion. That’s what the kit
was for — to gently guide my
emotionally flattened self step
by step through the detailed
process of obtaining a divorce
that would please the county,
state and nation.

Why didn’t I just put the
whole irritating responsibility
into the hands of a lawyer? I had
a couple of reasons. Lawyers can
cost hundreds and the
do-it-yourself method came to
about $28. Also, I wanted some
control over the process, maybe
as a reaction to the emotionally
out-of-control months that had
preceded the decision to
divorce.

The kit's authors, attorney V.
Louise McCarren and Deidre T.
Nicholson, began by identifying

who the kit could help the most
— mainly couples who do not
have children and/or complex

financial holdings. The kit is
geared toward the “no-fault”
divorce. In order to file a

no-fault, the wife and husband
must both want to divorce and
must both agree on all the terms
of the divorce. Without this
agreement, lawyers are
necessary.

The kit provided examples of
all the necessary papers. It
included clear directions on the
whole process broken down into
each chronological step. My
basic task was to copy the
example forms word for word,
filling in my name or my
husband’s when appropriate.
The kit told me where and in
what order to send these
soon-to-be-legal documents. The
only creative part of the entire
procedure was formulating the
separation agreement with my
husband. This is a document in
which both parties agree on all
the details — who will get what,
when and how. They must also

agree on the standard no-fault
grounds for the divorce. This is
that they have lived apart for six
consecutive months and that

there is no reasonable chance
that they will resume their
marriage.

The papers are filed with the
county clerk's office at various

stages. I found the Chittenden
County Clerk’s office very
helpful. I never felt any
discrimination which I had

thought might happen because I
was handling my own case. (By
the way, doing-it-yourself in
legalese is “pro se.”)

My experience with the kit
and the process of legally doing
my own divorce was very
positive. I felt resourceful and
took pride in dealing effectively
with the previously intimidating
legal system. I still regret that
these legalities are required when
the nub of divorce is people's
feelings. But, given the
requirement, A Non-Lawyer’s
Guide to Getting a Divorce in
Vermont is a constructive,
satisfying way to do it.

REVIEW

The Women’s Room by Marilyn
French

Reviewed by

Barnee Escott

The fact that The Women’s
Room has become a national
bestseller indicates just how far
the Women’s Movement has
come in educating society.
Fifteen years ago, it would have
been too radical to be printed;
today, it is selling like hotcakes,
although its premise is nothing
new.

Marilyn French has written a
great text for a course in
“Feminism 101: Consciousness
Raising for Non-Feminists," and
it can be tremendously useful as
such. Ms. French explores the
lives of six women who met in
graduate school at Harvard in
1968; their husbands, children,
divorces, lovers — and most
importantly, their feelings about
themselves and each other as
they realize that the oppression
that they have each felt is a part
of the larger oppression of
women as a group. Ms. French’s
writing is sensitive and powerful;
through Mira, her main
character, she clearly describes
the emotions of a middle-class
woman’s growing dissatisfaction
with the role of suburban
homemaker, feelings that are
shared among the other women
who are Mira’s friends: “’...By
this time, all of us had a word. It
was THEM, and we all meant the
same thing by it: men... We
excoriated THEM to the point
of nausea, but that was all it
was, vomiting the immediate
cause of indigestion. The
sickness, though, was chronic.
We understood that the laws
were all for THEM, that the
setup of society was all for
THEM, that everything existed
for THEM. But we didn’t know
what to do about that. We half
believed there was something

terribly wrong with US. We
crept into our holes and learned
to survive.”’

In the 687 pages of her book,
Ms. French touches on nearly all
the events and emotions that
women share: childbirth and
raising children; rape; rape of
one’s daughter; wife-beating;
relationships between men and
women; between women and
women; relationships that end in
divorce or separation, because
the men were not able to regard
women’s needs and desires as
equally important to their own.
Ms. French exposes the basic
cause of the sexual problems of
men and women through Mira
and her relationships with her

male lovers; Ms. French
contributes nothing new to
feminist theory, but traces

Mira’s growth as a sexual person
with a sensitivity that most
women will relate to.

As the six women become
more deeply involved in the life
of the University, their activism
increases, started by the anti-war
movement and culminating, for
one of the women, in radical
feminist separatism, when she
realizes that “’...For forty-odd
years I've been a member of an
oppressed people consorting
with the enemy, advancing the
enemy's cause. In some places
that’s called slavery. I’m through
with it. I want to work with
these women, those who give
their lives up for our cause.”

In an interesting turn of
events, the token lesbian of the
story, who is in the closet when
Mira meets her, becomes the
most beautiful, happiest and
most successful of the six
women. This simplistic approach
to the problems of lesbians in
this society does not address the
legal hassles or child custody
battles that lesbians have to

deal with; nevertheless, it is nice,
in a bestseller, to see a lesbian
portrayed as a winner, as a

beautiful and desirable woman
with admirable qualities as a
human being.

For those of you whose
mothers, sisters, daughters,
friends, lovers need some basic

consciousness raising, I highly
recommend The Women’s Room
as a holiday or birthday gift; for

feminists, I’m afraid that Ms.
French has nothing new to
teach.
