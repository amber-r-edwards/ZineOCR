Dear Sisters:

Some thoughts
12/81 Commonwoman.

Phyllis Sawyer’s poetry was
to the point, clear, strong and
therefore wonderful!

Jean Palmer’s letter
bothered and saddened me. If as
women we don’t want to read
what's happening to us — who
will? I believe we must know
what is happening to women as a
class, so we can react as a class
and not close our eyes — until
our time comes to read of
ourselves in Atrocities and hope
that others are reading and
supporting us too. Although enough
goes on “even here” in Vt., it’s
important to realize we have to
multiply the violence by millions
to really see what is happening
to us as women in the world (of
men).

Sandy Baird exaggerates and
mis-speaks when she says all
women have a bit of hooker...
all women get along by fucking/
being fucked by men, and that
all of us know we “have to keep

oy

on the

on the favorable side of men” (is
there one?), Rubbish! She
should be more clear that she is
talking about some women who
have not (yet) rejected as
unworthy and unacceptable

heterosexuality. Myths that say

women need/require men —
especially on men’s terms —
should not be perpetuated.

Many women have rejected what
Sandy puts forth for all women,
and more should be encouraged
to, not discouraged.

Thanks for printing the
Listening... and Moving article.
But, again, paragraphs were out
of order, making it confusing
and discouraging. In the same
article, my intention and spelling
should have remained as: “We
are listening to the phallacies (as
in...) told by the ray-gun admin-
istration.”

It's great to read a paper in
December and not see
“many days left for Xmas
shopping!”

Love,

Deane Brittingham

support

Dear Women:
Along with other Coalition
members, we wish to make

known our support of Deane
Brittingham’s lawsuit against the
Governor’s Commission on the
Status of Women. The Vermont
Coalition Against Domestic Vio-
lence, which is the statewide
organization of direct service
providers, wants to make clear
that this suit affects the Coali-
tion as a whole and battered
women as well as Deane.

The issue of the lawsuit is
that the Commission misrepre-
sented their hiring process. An
obvious motivation behind the
Commission's misrepresentation
is Deane’s open lesbian-feminist
politics.

This fraud and misrepresen-
tation unfortunately has wide-
spread effect due to the loss of
Deane as coordinator. Battered
women’s networks across the
state have suffered from a lack
of coordination, public educa-
tion and technical assistance for
these projects. When the Coali-
tion had the services of Deane as
the coordinator, we had a
broader orchestration of ser-
vices. Efficient services to bat-
tered women are essential since
battering is a life and death
situation.

Since there is no sexual
preference protection by Ver-
mont statute, Deane is not
protected by the civil rights
division and had to secure
a lawyer. Legal expenses will be
incurred by the case. We would
appreciate your public support.
Support letters, money, etc. can
be sent to the Deane Britting-
ham Defense Fund, Box 1367,
Montpelier, Vt. 05602.

thanks

Dear Commonwoman:

I am writing to thank the
Burlington community for its
incredible support of me and my
music. You gals have given me
the faith and courage to merci-
lessly push myself on unsuspect-
ing club owners and producers,
and to bill myself as “great.”
Thank you. Hearing your
whoops and laughter and cheers
and applause and even stunned
silence gives me the strength to
keep putting out for you, and
for myself. Your presence at
performances here and afar
(especially in Connecticut) helps
me to give my best, because I
know that there is at least
someone out there that likes
what I am doing. (Thanks also to
Baba Rose for the encouraging
review) *

I am sorry about the Hunt’s
fiasco, and tried to notify as
many people as possible that it
wasn't going to happen due to
corporate mix-up. I hope to
be able to audition there in late
January and will keep you
posted through mailings and a
note on the wall at Every-
woman's Place. I regret any
inconvenience that it caused
anyone in terms of travel, and
thank you for your support in
trying to help me out by being
there.

Thank you all for your
energy and encouragement. It
helps me.

Michigan?

With much appreciation,
Janice Perry aka Gal

My dear Commonwomyn.
Always it is a special day

when I see CW in my mailbox.
I appreciate your fortitude, per-
severance, intelligence and wis-
dom. So thanks for keeping me
in touch with Vermont and all
you lovely womyn.

Open Letter to the Women Who
Told Coming Out Stories at the
Women’s Center, Dec. 4:

I was there and I listened. I
did not speak (except for two
short comments) — there was no
room for me to speak, or for
other less privileged women.
Most of you spoke of coming
out in college, or being scared to
leave your middle-class marri-
ages. You spoke of the relief you
felt, how much stronger you are
now, and how impressed you
were with the sisterhood and
sense of community you felt
around radical Lesbians here.
But somehow all that commu-
nity of watching out for each
other, and caring, and sisterhood
never includes some women.
Every time there was a little
piece of silence in which some
one different could begin a
story, one of the “community
stars” would leap into it, adding
to their own previously told
stories or commenting on some
one else’s. That you told your
stories is fine, but that you left
no space to hear stories from
other women, from working
class women, stories that might
include pain and criticism of the
so-called community is definite-
ly not OK.

One Lesbian I know is a
welfare mother, raised poor, and
put into an insane asylum at age
16 for electroshock treatments.
Only her lover helps with child
care. She has no car and rarely
gets out of Burlington. She had
to give up one child in order to
survive. She’s a Lesbian, but I
don’t see anyone trying to
include her in the “community.”

Another Lesbian I know is
also a welfare mother. She can't
afford to come to women’s
center events if they cost
money, and none of them care
even being advertised as “pay
more if you can, less if you
can’t.” When she comes to free
discussions, she doesn't talk
much — she never graduated
from high school and can hardly
get through the wall of educated
assumptions you all build when
you talk. She knows you'll think
she’s stupid, in spite of her
intelligence and strength. She
may not know the latest in
feminist theory, but she knows
what her life has been like, and
the lives of her friends and
lovers. But you are so oblivious
to the fact that she even exists
that you won't try to create a
space that’s as comfortable for
her as for you. That’s a measure
of your privilege and your
arrogance about your commun-
ity.

There are lots of other
stories of women whom you
don’t include in your commun-
ity.

I'm getting a lot of messages
that my anger is unacceptable in
your community, that I'm
putting out divisive energy, that
it’s not all right to confront
women when they're trying so
hard to build a community,
especially since the rest of the
world is so hostile. Well, all
those arguments were used to
keep Lesbians quiet in the
women’s movement ten years
ago. So now the middle and
upper class Lesbian community
doesn’t want to be confronted
or hear any anger from less
privileged women. You're
passing on your oppression — as
long as you can feel better than
someone, you can feel OK.

I’m an angry woman. I’m
also middle class, and even I hear
that other middle class and
upper class Lesbians in the
community write off what I
say because I’m angry. No
wonder so many of the working
class Lesbian activists have left
this town. There is no space for
my anger within the upper and
middle class looks-privileged
community. You can all — as
you did at the coming out
discussion — congratulate your-
selves and each other on your
community and your ideals. But
I want you to understand that
your community is built to
exclude, not to include. And
every time you say “the
community” you mean primarily
upper and middle class
(not to mention — looks-
privileged) women. Some of us
gag every time you say “sister-
hood” because we know “you
don’t mean us.
