LETTER FROM  
THE COLLECTIVE  

The Commonwoman Collective grew out of a shared vision and a need to have a publication by and for  
Women in Vermont. We are a collective of twelve feminists with diverse lifestyles and backgrounds. We  

envision Commonwoman as a forum for feminists separated by class, politics, economics, theology, and  
sexual preference. Commonwoman is also an exploration and celebration of our similarities.  

We will consider for publication all articles submitted by women. Since we wish to provide space for  
dialogue, we especially encourage letters and articles which are in response to published articles.  

We are organized as a not-for-profit corporation. Management, decision making, and daily operations are  
shared by all. At this point, we are not able to pay ourselves for our work, nor can we offer money to  
contributors. A statement of our financial position is available on request, and will be printed in future  
issues... LET’S DEPEND ON EACH OTHER!  

COMMONWOMAN an uncommon newspaper.  

Letters to the Editors —  

Response from  
One Witch  

Dear Commonwoman:  

As a member of Witch One  
(but not as a spokesperson for  
the other people in the band) I  
have the following responses to  
Linda Wittenberg‘s article (issue  
no. 2, Commonwoman) entitled  
“Witch One at The Mill:”  

“Women's music” is,  
according to Linda, “music  
through which an energy flows  
that allows for people to dance  
in groups or circles, for people  
to dance alone or together, for  
people to smile and laugh.” To  
imply that only women can  
make this kind of music is  
absurd. Rock and disco music do  
have an aggressive, perhaps  
culturally stereotypically “male”  
quality; and popular music does  
have offensive lyrics often  
enough, but these are hardly the  
only kind of music made by  
men. There are plenty of men  
and women playing gentle,  
strong, and beautiful jazz,  
classical and traditional music in  
this country and around the  
world; and plenty of other  
women and men listening,  
smiling, and dancing in circles.  
I've seen it myself. The  
communication that happens  
between musicians and  
audiences is other than that of  
the lyrics; how else could Witch  
One make the “male music” of  
Dylan, Van Morrison and  
Jackson Browne palatable  
simply by changing a few words?  

So the very real sense of  
community which happens at  
The Mill does not happen  
because we play some special  
kind of “women’s music.” We  
are women playing music, and  
are supportive of, supported by,  
and part of the women’s  
community of Burlington. The  
beautiful women who share their  
music with us through their  
dancing and support, multiply  
our energies by an incalculable  
amount. Thank you for that  
magic.  

Considering the “community  
feeling” that Linda and I have  
both mentioned, brings me to  
another question addressed by  
Linda: Why have straight women  
and men been noticeable in their  
absence at The Mill and in their  
reticence to dance? Linda's  
statements that “heterosexuals  
find it hard to confront their  
self-images as straight,” and that  
“strong independent” women  
are threatening to men are  
certainly partial answers with  
relevance in individual cases. I  
feel strongly that there is a more  
general, simpler reason: straight  
men and women feel left out.  

I cannot be sure of what other  
people are feeling, but I can  
remember walking into rooms  
full of people who seemed  
bonded in a community of  
which I was not a member. I  
have felt uptight-honky in a  
black nightclub, unappreciated  
in a gay men’s bar, imperialistic  
and tongue-tied in my Spanish in  
a San Salvadorean restaurant,  
and hopeless as a shikse and a  
hick besides, being a  
small-town-Irish-Catholic  
girlfriend visiting a New York  
City nice-Jewish boyfriend's  
family.

Reader  

Dear Sisters,  

I read with interest and pride  
the first issue of Common-  
woman. I am struck with both  
the importance of having a  
feminist publication available in  
the community and with  
excitement at seeing my “selves”  
in print.  

Though we are all unique as  
human beings, we are also  
products of the same culture  
and, as such, there is much we  
share.  

Hurray for the values you all  
share that make this newspaper  
worth the effort. Hurray for us  
all that those values have  
survived this culture!  

Commonwoman is not only  
all of us (in spite of Chittenden  
Bank’s patronizing ad), but also  
the bond between us.  

I will support you in spirit —  
and monetarily when I can — in  
exchange for this tribute to  
womankind you must work so  
hard to produce.  

In struggle and  

celebration

Mission  

Possible  
To the Editor:  

In response to the letter from  
Robin Lloyd regarding Mission  
Possible, we would like to reply  
that Mission Possible is a  
concept which grew out of our  
time in Africa. African socialism,  
as exhibited in Tanzania, and the  
determination of the Freedom  
Fighters, were catalysts to our  
conception of a new community  
of women. We envisioned a  
catchment place, such as a  
downtown women’s  
bar-restaurant, where women  
could be radicalized in a political  
sense; and we envisioned a  
country retreat where women  
could experience basic training,  
similar to that which men  
receive in the military. Cadres of  
women would then take this  
knowledge and start similar  
communities across the nation  
and around the world, weaving a  
network of collective living and  
educational centers.  

Our basic vision is unchanged,  
namely the development of a  
new community. However, our  
focus is no longer separatist. It  
stems from female energy and  
concepts from feminist  
philosophy to include men and  
women of the New Age who are  
seeking higher consciousness and  
enlightenment. The community  
would encourage open,  
cooperative, self-sufficient living;  
it would house a healing,  
educational, and spiritual center,  
and it would emphasize  
discipline and growth for the  
body, mind and spirit.  

We still believe there should  
be a Woman's Place for  
gathering, providing mutual  
support for activities, and  
consciousness-raising. We believe  
there should be a Men's Place for  
the same purposes. And we  
believe there should be a  
vegetarian-health food restaurant  
to serve both groups and those  
New Age persons looking for a  
community.  

Mission Possible is happening.  
It is evolving through the  
energies of many persons. Please  
add yours!
