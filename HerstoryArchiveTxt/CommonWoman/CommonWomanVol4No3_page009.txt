“We take our essentialness  
as self-evident now and our work  
begins with this.”  

Susan Griffin  

‘Men are taught to rape and  
they are encouraged by other  
men to do it. It is a measure of  
masculinity for too many. Gang  
rape is a particularly vicious type  
of rape.  

Though it would seem un-  
necessary to use force when the  
victim is so outnumbered, Prof.  
Menachem Amir, in his  
study of rapists found “the most  
excessive degrees of violence  

occurred in group rape.” Men  

egg each other on in their  
violation of the female they wish  
to degrade to prove themselves  

‘men, for in our culture to be a  
man means dominating and  
controlling women. Robin Mor-  
gan points out that “Knowing  
our place is the message of rape  
as it was for blacks the message  
of lynchings — an act of political  
terrorism.” Through fear women  
are encouraged to turn to men  
for protection, though the real  
ity is that most rapes are by men  
known to the victim, be he  
father, acquaintance, co-worker  
or neighbor.  

“Gang rape is probably the  
earliest form of male bonding” is  
the conclusion Susan Brown-  
miller comes to after studying its  
universal instance. She goes on  
to say that it happens mostly  
with working-class youth gangs.  
The events at Sigma Nu show  
that it occurs in the middle and  
‘upper classes as well, but there is

class. These men have their own  
house and no need to be out on  
the street. They have a brother-  
hood with initiation rites to  
encourage bonding. They have  
the protection of the college and  
‘of monied alumni who would  
hate to see the name of their frat  
sullied. Fraternities are notori-  
ous among women for rape in its  
somewhat more subtle forms  
and Sigma Nu is notorious on  
the University of Vermont cam-  
pus for its woman-hating behav-  
ior.  
Recent Events in Burlington:  

‘A woman reported being  
gang raped by eight members of  
Sigma Nu. The same woman  

to establish anonymity for  

women to encourage ‘their  
reporting of rape.  
Another fact: rape is the  

fastest growing of all violent  
crimes and was up 9% last year.  
Some people wonder why  
women at the march reacted so  
angrily. Others wondered how  
some could be so gentle. When  
the Take Back the Night march  
ended up in front of Texas, a  
Sigma Nu hangout, there were  
men who shouted, “Let’s have a  
rape party” and “You're too  
ugly to get raped.” For women  
who know these are the very  
attitudes that promote rape, it  
was too much and they vented  
their rage on the offending  

whew the men

reported her life was threatened  
if she exposed the rapists. The  
UVM Women’s Referral Center  
asks for Sigma Nu’s charter to be  
revoked and that the campus  
community boycott all Sigma  
Nu activities. The Greek Coor-  
dinating Council decides Sigma  

*Nu should apologize to three  

sororities for inappropriate  
social behavior, which it declines  

to name.  
A Take Back the Night  
march, Burlington's largest,  

surrounds Sigma Nu demanding  
the names of the rapists and  
many women and some men  
express their rage at the frater-  
nity and the university they feel  
is protecting it.  

The woman declines to  
press charges, saying she could  
not handle everything a trial  
would entail.  

The Burlington Free Press is  
planning to print the names of  
rape victims against the will of  
women who have worked hard  

males. In a statement heard on  
WRUY, Lynn Vera, Katey Wolff  
and Linda Wittenberg say  
“Rape is about our lives; every  
time a woman is raped, her life is  
at stake, she's not in control  
‘one man or many will do what  
they want...drunk, sober, angry  
violent men. She cannot stop a  
rape, neither can she stop  
mutilation of her body or  
murder. These fears are part of  
our everyday existence. When  
we've had enough and we scream  
‘our rage at men who say we ask  
for it, deserve it, wanted it  
anyway, are we being so radi-  
cal?”  

The rape myth says every  
woman wants it. Women are  
taught to be rape victims, the  
complement to men being  
taught rape. Women grow up  
learning that they must be  
careful not to excite a man, that  
he will be uncontrollable should  
she step over some line that will  
arouse his necessarily satisfied

lust. This gives men a great  
freedom from any responsible  
behavior and puts the burden all  
‘on women. In fact, rape is not a  
crime of insatiable lust but one  
of violence and violation.  

The courts favor the rapist  
and put the burden of corrobor-  
ation on the victim. None of this  
is surprising, since the judges and  
legislators who make up the laws  
likely as not have participated in  
some form of male bonding that  
involved the degradation, if not  
the actual rape, of a woman.  
Likely as not it happened in a  
fraternity. Another tribute to  
male bonding is the Free Press  
attempting to undo the work of  
women who have tried to  

protect the anonymity of the  
rape victim by printing her name  
and making her even more  

vulnerable to male attack.  

As long as men, controlling  
the media, the courts, the laws,  
the police, can make women see  
themselves as men wish them to  
— that is as objects of incite-  
ment, objects of lust, victim  
objects and passive receivers of  
unbridled male sexuality — rape  
will go on. Rape is meant to  
show her she cannot do what she  
wishes. It is the most intense  
violation of her self-determina-  
tion short of murder. It means  
to kill the self in women. She  
can be used and thrown away.  
She is at the mercy of the  
nearest man who wishes to rape.  

Women being angry, showing  
their rage, strikes at the heart  
of this enforcement of passivity.  
It goes against the role we are  
assigned,...it infuriates men,  
upsets other women. It is  
difficult even for the women  
who rage because it is against all  
that a woman is supposed to be.  

Women are not being nice about  
this anymore. There is nothing  
to lose but passivity by resisting.  
We need self-defense classes in  
schools as well as woman-  
staffed sex crime units in the  
police force. Sigma Nu is not  
forgotten and continued pres-  
sure needs to be put on the  
University to disclose the actual  
instances of rape on campus.  
Women are affirming their  
right to self-determination in all  
areas and in this one we will  
have to be very forceful and  
unladylike. But as Robin Morgan  
says, “women are every day  
becoming less concerned with  
being graceful and more bent on  
being free.” If you are not angry  
think about why.  

about rape  

Prick Tracy  

“Not only are myths about  
rape forms of social control, but  
myths about how to avoid rape  
are forms of social control.”  
Pauline Bart, sociologist  
(quoted in Off Our Backs)  
“Good afternoon, ladies,”  
the man said. “My name is Tim  
Rollins and I'm from Operation  

Crimefight. This is a session on  
how to prevent sexual assault.  
Operation Crimefight is an inter-  
national organization funded by  

private industry, but I'm not  
here to sell you anything. I’m a  
veteran of ten years with the  
Burlington Police, five of those  

years as a detective, so I know  
what I’m talking about.”  

So it began — another  
gathering of women listening to  
a man tell us how to behave so  
we don't get attacked, and how  
men think we should respond  
when we are attacked. The  
gathering was sponsored by the  
Trinity College Women’s Center.  

Rollins began by listing the  

common rape/sexual assault  
myths (women invite rape by  
their dress, or action, it’s a  

sexual response...) He also said  
that it’s a myth that women  
need bruises in order to have a  

successful prosecution. He said  
that the attacker is an “emo-  
tionally unstable male” looking  
for an “object” (read woman) to  
vent his rage and frustration on,  
to humiliate. Rollins seemed  
unaware of the studies which  
have shown that a majority of  
rapists are known to their  
victims and not strangers jump-  
ing out of the bushes. Rollins  

stressed that an assault can hap-  
pen anywhere a woman is alone  

(a subtle wording of the dictum  
that we should all belong to  
some protective male and never  
be alone).  

In the home, Rollins  
recommended solid-core doors  
without windows, deadbolt  
locks, and peephole viewers.  

Don't open doors to strangers,  
don’t depend on chain locks  
(easily ripped out of the door or  

cut by bolt cutters). A cheap  
rubber wedge-shaped doorstop is  
better protection against being  
barged in on, according to  
Rollins. Don’t give out personal  
information on the phone, don’t  
list your street address in the  

phone book, don’t give informa-  
tion to city directories. Put extra  
names on the mailbox. A lot of  
this advice makes sense, but  
remember that locks aren't going  
to help when the rapist is a  

“friend” you have let inside  
your apartment.  
Prevention of assault in  

your car goes along similar lines,  
according to Rollins: park in a  
well-lighted place, have keys in  
hand, check the rear floor of the  
car before entering. If you're being  
followed in a car, don’t go home  
— go to the police station or fire  
station or a neighbor's house.  

When walking, always be  
aware of who is around you and  
how long he has been there.  
Walk in the middle of the road  
(beware the bushes!). If you  
need help, walk into a house —  
don’t wait to knock — or break a  

window if necessary. “Above  
all,” he said, “DON’T HITCH-  
HIKE!” The college women  
laughed.  

The gist of these prevention  
techniques is that women should  
curtail lives because of  
men’s antisocial behavior. Rape  
is punishment for being too free,  
a threat reinforcing male power.  
The so-called prevention tech-  
niques also reinforce male power  
and threaten women’s freedom.  

When “prevention” fails and  
you are attacked, what then?  
Rollins’ advice was given in this  
order:  

My FEAR  

By Euan Bear  

1) Plan ahead: anticipate  
think about what you’re most  
afraid of (being raped, being  
injured, harm to a child, etc.)  

2) “Don't aggravate the  
situation unnecessarily.”  

Scratching the face or a missed  
or blocked knee to the groin  
may infuriate the attacker.  

3) Scream. Yell fire — you'll  
get more response.  

4) RUN — if you have a  
reasonable chance of getting  
away.  

5) Disrupt the rapist’s con-  
trol over the situation by doing  
the unexpected: act crazy, fake  
a heart attack or an epileptic  
seizure — be convincing. Vomit  
or urinate.  

6) Talk. Humanize yourself  
to the attacker. Talk about your  
family, kids, etc. Don't beg, cry  
or plead.  

7) FIGHT. Commit yourself  
to doing real damage — causing  
pain and injury. The face and  
the throat are targets — the  
stomach is not (too many strong  
muscles). Rollins stressed repeat-  
edly that the last thing to try  
was to fight, saying that once  
you've started to fight you can’t  
retreat and “try some other  
technique.”  

But two studies have come  
out saying that “women who  
fight, scream, and try to run  
away are more successful in  
avoiding rape than those who  
talk, cry, plead, or appeal to the  
humanity of the assailant. The  

Can you imagine a world without rape?

DIFFERENCE!  

studies are reported and ana-  
lyzed in the February, 1981,  
issue of Off Our Backs (p. 9).  
‘One study, by Pauline Bart of  
the University of Illinois Medical  
Center, involved interviews with  
94 women in the Chicago area.  
The other, by Jeannie McIntyre,  
University of Maryland, reviewed  
320 rapes in the Washington,  

D.C. area. McIntyre wrote, “it is  
a mistake to tell women to  
consistently be compliant,  
because in some confrontations  
active resistance is the most  
effective.”  

OOB also talked to police  
rape prevention units in six  
cities. All but one encouraged  
women to use passive resistance  
‘and cognitive techniques, a la  
Frederick Storaska’s book, How  
to Say No to a Rapist and  
Survive, before or instead of  
active resistance. But Bart and  
McIntyre both found that pas-  
sive techniques don’t work often  
and can lose valuable time.  
Further, Bart found that while a  
woman is more likely to avoid  
rape by physically resisting, her  
chances of being injured increase  
only slightly. Not resisting is no  
guarantee of not being injured.  
The studies also support fighting  
back right away — the longer the  
assault situation continues, the  
more likely you are to be  
maneuvered into an isolated or  
enclosed area and taped and/or  
hurt.  

So, yes, plan ahead, but  

TELLING THEY  

COMMON WOMAN May, 1981  

and the Crime Stoppers  

realize your danger and fight  
back as soon as you can, scream,  
run. You're more likely to avoid  
rape. And when you fight,  
remember that this man has  
attacked you to humiliate and  
hurt — don’t be afraid to hurt  
back. Go for the eyes or the  
knees. Practice whatever you  
plan to do.  

We need to realize that  
policeMEN keep telling us not to  
resist and we keep getting raped.  
We can fight back, and sometimes  
we can win. We can learn  
self-defense techniques. We can  
put the responsibility for rape  
right back where it belongs: on  
MEN’s shoulders. We can refuse  
to let them convince us to give  
in. “(For a fuller discussion of  
the studies and their findings,  
see “New Studies Support  
Active Resistance to Rape,” by  
Tacie Dejanikus and others, in  
Off Our Backs, vol. 9, no. 2,  
February, 1981.)  

Social or “date” rape is so  
common, most people do  
not even recognize it as  
rape. We are taught not  
to speak firmly or strongly,  
then are blamed for not  
saying “no” loudly enough.  
Always it is the victim’s  
responsibility...
