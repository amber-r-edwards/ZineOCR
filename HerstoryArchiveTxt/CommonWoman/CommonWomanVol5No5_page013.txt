some ropes to strain against?

Some women who were
battered as children may be
drawn to certain kinds of S&M
activities because they may be
used to or comfortable with
some particular interactions.
Some women who are involved
in S&M say they are working
through some of the violent
experiences of their pasts. This
may be their intention but how
will it be worked through if it is
associated repeatedly with sex-
ual pleasure and perhaps
orgasm? To my mind, the
activities, be they violent or
fantasies of violence, or teasing
with violence or situations of
dominance/submission, will be
reinforced in a very behavior-
mod sort of way by being
connected with sexual pleasure.

Even though activities may
not be physically harmful but on
the psychological or fantasy
level... examples would be teas-
ing with a whip or humiliating
someone by actions or words...
we can still be asking ourselves:
where is this taking us? Is this
the direction we want to be
moving in? Is this just rein-
forcing old-timey boy/girl and
oppressor/victim patterns? What
is feminist about this?

Some women speak of the
trust that must exist between
partners in an S&M relationship.
This may be so, but is this what
we want to be doing with our
power to trust?

Women who are supportive
of S&M say: Lesbians should
know what it’s like to be in the
closet and should be supporting
us “coming out” of the S&M
closet. It is, in fact, painful to be
closeted about one’s actions, but
just because someone is in the
closet about something does not
necessarily mean that those
actions are O.K. I can support

people “coming out” about
what they do, but I may not be
able to support what it is they
are actually doing. I would then
need to think about — their
actions... check it out, before I
could decide to be or not to be
supportive.

In Susan Griffin's new
book, Pornography and Silence,
she makes connections between
sadism, pornography and fas-
cism. Do other women make
these connections? Is this the
reason why, according to Pat
Califia, there are very few
women involved in S&M who are
interested in playing the S? This
book develops a deeper under-
standing of domination or power
over which Griffin began so well
in Women and Nature. I recom-
mend it.

Are those who chose to be
in the M. role finally feeling
validated for being submissive?
Are women switching roles as
they act out their S&M? This
feels better to me than not
switching but even so it may still
be reinforcing an up/down situa-
tion. It seems that a lot of our
problems come from putting
ourselves or each other up or
down in many subtle and not so
subtle ways. Do we want to
repeat this way of relating
and be rewarded sexually for it?

I’m sure that some women
who engage in what they would
call S&M may be, in fact, being
direct, progressive and honest in
their behavior and I’m sure that

many women who would say
they aren’t into S&M behave in
ways that are indirect, abusive,
and dishonest. My intention is
not to put down, but I do feel
put down by one expression
coming out of S&M culture:
“vanilla sex.” This term is used
to define anything that is not
S&M. The implication is that it
is bland and ordinary. I reject
this put down. Women have the
potential for being creative and
sexually wild without needing to
put each other up or down in
reality or in fantasy. Just being
direct and honest can be an
exciting element in a sexual
encounter.

I won't say that I have not
been turned on or could not in
the future be turned on by some
kinds of S&M experiences but
again the questions return... Is
this what I need? Is it pulling me
toward my feminist goals? Some
women are choosing S&M but is
this happening in the context of
feminism or as part of a feminist
vision?

encourages Eva's feelings, and
whose love for her heritage and

her grandmother lends some
hope to this painful story.
There is so much pain

wrapped around and through the
moments of pleasure in this
aging woman's life. She who
longs for solitude and quiet
memories is expected to be the
social, doting grandmother by
most of her family. No one,
until the granddaughter, under-
stands her need for safe, familiar
routine in her own space.

The film affected me deep-
ly. I, along with most of the
audience, cried and often sob-
bed. There are few breaks in the
tension, but it does not feel at
all contrived or manipulative; it
only feels too honest and sad. I
think of how separate we are in
this whitewashed culture from
our ethnicity and our older ones,
how horrible it is that old people
in the U.S. are often poor and
shuffled around, rarely cared for
in an easy familiar home space.
It also made unignorable the
horror of the murder/genocide
of millions of Jewish peoples,
and how intense and special that
culture that has dared to and
fought to survive is. One of the
most moving scenes in the film
happens in San Francisco. Eva
and her husband run into an old
friend, also Jewish and also from

Russia. They attend her 80th
birthday party. The room is
filled with friends, all older
people, the great majority Jew-
ish people from “the old coun-
try.” The music is traditional
and the people know the Heb-
rew or Yiddish (my own ignor-
ance here) sung and their faces
light up with joy. Eva, near her
own death, cries and dances with
pleasure and pain mixed and for
the first time in the hour you've
watched, finally a feeling that
she is indeed where she wants to
be.

The film celebrates women,
celebrates and treasures the
Jewish race, and refuses to let
anyone who sees it rest easy
about growing old or getting
sick. It is about loneliness, and
family relationships, about
loving and about letting go. It
moved me more than any film
ever and I recommend it strong-
ly. It’s not easy to watch, but do
go.
