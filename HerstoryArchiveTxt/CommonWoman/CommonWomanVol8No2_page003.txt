We need money. The bank account is empty. If not for a
large contribution from a local woman (thank you, amiga), this
issue wouldn't be paid for. We need your help... there are only a
few of us, we can’t do it all forever. Want to hold a fundraiser
for us? Want to give us a tax-deductible contribution? Got any
better ideas?? Help!

Notes from the Core

The Editorial Committee would really like reader feedback
on what we put in the paper. We often have to make choices for
space reasons and would appreciate your input.

Commonwomon will be published every 8 weeks (or so)
from now on. Actually, even though the masthead has read
“every 6 weeks;” our cycle has more often been 8 weeks. So we
decided to recognize that and accept it. In case you don’t have a
picture of it: we lay out the paper, then women mail and distri-
bute it, then we all relax until someone on editorial calls someone
else and sets a meeting, and then the whole process starts again. It
starts with what you contribute... that shapes the next issue. It
also keeps us encouraged and motivated.

We're happy to have an ad person again. Ellie has done a
great job for a very long time. We are thankful to her for all her
work, and welcome Josi to Commonwomon ad sales.

Finally, THANK YOU FOR COMING TO THE BENEFIT. It
was a tremendous success, and we are very grateful to Josi, who
planned it all; to Missy, who spun the discs for many hours and
did a fine job; to Rosie for childcare, and to the people at Pearl's
for the atmosphere, the good food, and the willingness to try. We
made $500 — many women were generous and we thank you all.
We have received very positive feedback about holding a “Tea
dance” on a Sunday afternoon when work exhaustion or antici-
pation doesn’t dampen spirits. We hope to do it again — anyone
want to help plan it? If so, contact someone on the core group.
We'd love the help.

Also: Send in your suggestions for dance tunes — come and
dance to your favorite songs at the next benefit:

Don’t forget to mail this in...

AND CONTRIBUTE YOUR WRITING AND DRAWINGS TO
COMMONWOMON — see yourself in print!

We still need distribution help, and there is a paid position
available to sell ads.

Commonwomon needs all material submitted to be typed,
double-spaced. Articles should not exceed four pages in length. If
you want unused material returned, enclose a SASE.

I swear it to you

and will rise!

Due Credit

Dear Sisters,

I'm writing to support Nina’s
calling you on the misprints, wrong
again to cite Reweaving.

Perhaps someday we will not
need to be attached to that which we
create; but to encourage originality
and discourage scenes of 1984, I hope
that we continue giving credit where
credit’s due.

Handbook for Women on the
Nuclear Mentality was created, like
Commonwomon, by hundreds of
volunteer hours. That deserves credit.

And thanks for all
the good work you do.

Woman Against Psychiatry

Dear Commonwomon:

I appreciate the numerous posi-
tive responses to my article last issue
on the anti-psychiatry movement. In
all of my work on the Queen of
Hearts project, that article was the
most productive thing I did in
helping to change the attitude toward
psychiatrically oppressed women.
Thank you, Commonwomon. Not
only did women say they were
educated by the article, but I actually
saw a sincere desire to change. I saw
women taking emotional outbursts in
stride and offering love and healing,
where once there was only anger and
ostracism. Blessed Be.

At the present time, Queen of
Heart has had to move out of the
farmhouse in Plainfield. It seems that
a resident center was premature, and
we found ourselves understaffed and
over our heads in personal conflict,
management, and criticism from the
landlord. We have discussed the
possibility of being located in Bur-
lington for a stronger feminist base.
When more Burlington women show
an avid interest in committing time
to the project, and when a sizeable
collective is formed, then we might be
able to offer ongoing services in the
area. It would be good to have a
one-to-one advocacy program for
dealing with the mental health
system, safe-house alternatives for
crisis, and peer counseling as well as
peer support groups. We could
support art, music, dance, video, and
movie-making projects — the creative
possibilities are endless because the
nature of psychiatric oppression is
the holding down of creative energy,
so liberation means the release of
that same energy. It all requires a
commitment to help, and until more
feminist women are interested, we
are reducing our goals and concen-
trating mainly on public education.

The psychiatric system is en-
gaged in the rape and battering of the
mind, and it affects the thought and
behavior of all of us and not just its
immediate victims. Thus it seemed
altogether appropriate for the
witches to gather at Queen of Heart
for drumming, dancing, and ritual
healing. It gives me hope that some-
day we will see no oppressive differ-
ences between those who are accept-
ably wild and those who are un-
acceptably wild. At the Warrior's
Circle of Michigan ’82, the women
sang out as much about psychiatric
oppression as about sexual oppres-
sion keeping them down. If we
profess to be wild, let us not shut out
our wilder sisters.

Thanx,
Jesse

Dearest friends:

We were all delighted to see our
notice in print in your January 1984
issue of Commonwomon. All of us
being locked up at this point in time
makes it very difficult for us to do
the many things we would like to do.
Through the help such as you have
given us with the time and space
made available to us, we are able to
make ourselves known to the corrupt
giant we fight, and that is a small
step forward indeed. Thanks! Those
persons responsible for the wording
did a super job!

Several replies have already
come in with our answers to them
going out immediately.

Whoever all you wonderful
people are up there in cold... cold
Vermont, you are with us here in
hot... hot Arizona, in our hearts and
in our thoughts,

In the last issue, in Sondra Stansell's piece, edited by Ann Snitow, Christine Corry’s book title was incorrectly written. It should have read: Powers of Desire: an anthology on the Politics of Sexuality.
