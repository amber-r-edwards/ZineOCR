- @: WOMEN TERRORIZED once again) @

= On January 6, another
of project. “Upper Crust”
was implemented, as 230 Prison
Guards and State Troopers
fired in paramilitary “riot
gear” raided the women’s prison
facility at Massachusetts Correc-
tional Institution (MCI) — Fram-
ingham. This stunt was com-
pleted, at a cost to taxpayers of
about $34,500 in overtime pay-
ment to law officers along, to
obtain contraband — allegedly
present in the women’s rooms.
This was done in order to link
this group of prisoners to a

purported drug ring and gaming. The operation said to be existing in
four New England states and
New York. The ultimate result
of this raid is that 5 prisoners
have been indicted on tax-
evasion charges for a computer
business, one of the inmate
employment and job training
groups. These indictments are
entirely irrelevant to any of the

stated intentions and justifica-

tions of this raid given to the
public by state mouthpieces.

During this raid, the police
used terrorist tactics which are
reminiscent of methods em-
ployed in the earliest days of
concentration camps in Nazi
Germany. Women were pulled
from their beds while sleeping,
partially clad or nude and were
poked and prodded with night-
sticks, hands, knees and feet by
State Troopers dressed in full
riot gear. The women’s hands
were handcuffed behind their
backs and they were not allowed
to dress in most cases. Video-
taping occurred through the
entire raid and many male
officers looked on as female
prison guards subjected the
women to strip-searches and
“body-cavity” searches for the
alleged contraband. Police ver-
bally harassed the women,

On July 28, 1979 the bodies
of Edward Smith, age 14, and

Alfred Evans, age 13, were
found in a wooded area in
Atlanta, Georgia. No clues or
motives were found as to the
causes of their deaths. Almost
two years later, twenty-eight
young people had disappeared
and were consequently found
dead. There were still no clues,
motives, or explanations con-
cerning the deaths. Yet one
distinguishing factor did exist —
each and every one of the
murdered individuals was Black.
It took the authorities over
a year to put concrete effort
into investigating the case. A
special police task force was set
up to undertake one of the
biggest investigations in Ameri-
can history. On May 22, 1981, a
police stakeout team was sta-
tioned beneath the Jack

Parkway Bridge over the Chatta-
hoochee River on the outskirts 

of Atlanta. Several bodies had
been found in or around the
river. At about 3 a.m., the
officers heard a loud splash in
the water and saw a car moving
slowly across the bridge. They
radioed up to a second stakeout

calling them “bitches” as well as
many other degrading terms.
Women were not allowed to
urinate for more than an hour of
this torture and one woman with
a severe kidney infection was
told by a trooper to urinate on
the floor, which she did, unable
to control her bladder any
longer. The police themselves
did not hesitate to “tap their
kidneys” on the floors and walls
of women’s rooms in their
search for the alleged contra-
band, which was never found.
Police also took the liberty to

confiscate various per-
sonal papers, address books and
legal possessions, while dumping
coffee grounds into dresser
drawers and performing other
such pranks. Women were not
allowed to seek any legal counsel
or see their attorneys for a
period of 24 hours after the raid.

On January 20, nine women
filed a civil-rights suit against the
Massachusetts Department of
Correction to obtain some eco-
nomic restitution for emotional,
mental and physical abuses suf-
fered during this raid. The
ultimate outcome of the raid has
been to change the rating of the

prison in order to institute
radical policy changes due to
claims of various Dept. of
Correction Commissioners that
the prison was getting “out of
control” and that this con-
spiracy of organized prisoners
prompted the declarations of the
“emergency state” immediately
following the raid.

In order to elaborate the
facsimile of an “extreme” situa-
tion, the male prisoners were
removed from Framingham
without any notice or reclassifi-
cation hearings. This outrageous,
unjustified implementation of
less rights for the women prisoners
remaining at MCI-Framingham:
less personal belongings received
only once per month; more
restrictions on outside contact
and visiting rights — including
those for family, children and
legal advisors; and the cancella-

tion of many rehabilitation

After over a month of
severe media control regarding
this issue, an article finally

appeared in the Boston Globe on
February 22 questioning the
value of the raid and reporting
the facts in a less distorted
manner, as well as a mild criti-
cism of media coverage to date.

It is now obvious that the

state has fabricated an entire

“emergency” situation and raid
to obtain more monetary alloca-
tions for themselves for future
“projects” and to change the
prison rating at MCI-Framing-
ham to further limit prisoners’
rights. Commissioner Michael
Fair who “planted the seed” for
the idea of the raid, repeatedly
drops prisoner Susan Saxe’s

ATLANTA: REVISITED

23-year-old tree-lance — photo-
grapher. Two days later the
body of Nathaniel Cater, 27, was
found about a mile downstream
from the bridge, about 500 ft.
from where the body of Jimmy
Ray Payne, 21, was found a
month earlier. Williams was
questioned and surveyed by the
FBI for about a month. He was

arrested on June 21 and charged

with the murders of Cater and
Payne.

Thus began the nine-week
trial to prove the innocence or
guilt of Wayne Williams. The
prosecution began to put toge-
ther a very complex case against
the defendant. Their strongest
piece of evidence revolved
around fibers and hairs found on
the bodies of Cater and Payne
which matched identically with
fibers and hairs found in the
Williams’ home and car. Rare rug
fibers, manufactured by a single
company, were so uniquely
shaped that micromorphological ex-
perts testified it was almost
impossible for the fibers on the
bodies to have come from
anywhere else. But this was
purely circumstantial evidence,
no one can or should be con-

victing based on fiber identifica-

tion. Fiber identification can
only show the “possibility of
contact” between two sources,
not that contact actually took
place. The prosecution's case was
weak... until they asked for
special permission to submit
additional evidence to the court.

In a hearing not attended by
the jury, Assistant District
Attorney Joe Drolet stated that
he had information in the form
of witnesses, fibers, and blood-
stains linking Williams to the
deaths of ten other Atlanta
victims. Although Williams was
not being charged in the addi-
tional ten deaths, the prosecu-
tion believed this information
would show the pattern of
slayings, a pattern which inclu-
ded Cater and Payne. Defense
Attorneys Alvin Binder and
Mary Welcome immediately ob-
jected to the prosecution’s
request. They argued that evi-
dence about the other victims
would be biased and prejudicial
towards their client. They said

“the result would be a mistrial, or

a conviction reversal by an
appeals court if Williams was
found guilty.” Judge Clarence
Cooper disagreed. He ruled that
the evidence from the ten other
victims was admissible to unfold
a pattern, if any, which might
include the crimes in the indict-
ment against Williams. The
defense motioned for a mistrial,
Judge Cooper denied this
request. The trial continued.

Twelve witnesses were pro-
duced who testified they saw
Williams with seven of the slain
victims, including Cater. There
were also witnesses who testified
on Williams’ character. These
testimonies suggested he was a
homosexual with a very violent
temper. One witness described
seeing him become angry and
beat his father. He was also said
to have made derogatory state-
ments about poor young blacks.
Williams denied all charges and
accusations.

Jury trials are a debatable
topic. Advocates argue that trials
by jury protect individual rights
by working substantial justice.
The unbiased jurors must decide
the ‘guilt or innocence’ question
based on facts and concrete
evidence... not on speculation.
The decision must be unani-
mous. A guilty verdict should be

returned only if the prosecutor
has established guilt beyond any
reasonable doubt. If they have
any doubts whatsoever as to the
guilt of the defendant, the jury
is compelled by law to return a
non-guilty verdict.

Are there any reasonable
doubts in this case? The fiber
link is a severely damaging piece
of evidence. At least five differ-
ent types of fibers from the
Williams’ home and car matched
those found on twelve of the
bodies, including Cater and
Payne. But is there not a slight
chance that those fibers came
from another home? Atlanta is a
large city. Reasonable Doubt
Number One! Williams was por-
trayed as a homosexual “mad-
dog” killer with a vicious,
uncontrollable temper. His girl-
friend denied that he was gay
and the father, Homer Williams,
denied ever having a physical

confrontation with his son.
Reasonable Doubt Two & Three!

A witness for the defense, a
former police recruit, disclosed
that the officers on the stakeout
team often drank beer on duty.

It was suggested that they were

sleeping the night in May when
