worker earns about two dollars
per day. Once the exploited
workers organize a revolution to

change the political-economic
structure of their country, the
profits of these huge corporations
are terribly threatened, because
such a revolution would involve
nationalizing, whereby the U.S.
profiteers would either

be ousted or the workers would
have much improved working
conditions and much higher
wages. This is where the U.S.
government-U.S. business align-
ment comes into play. In order
to protect our “foreign interests,”
the U.S. government assists in the
attempt to squash the revolution,
thereby allowing American big
business to continue with its
exploitative practices. Another
reason the U.S. government is
concerned with preventing
revolution in El Salvador stems
from the effects of the “domino
theory.” Once the people of El
Salvador prove their ability to
overcome the repressive regime
attempting to control them, for
the sake of the profiteers, the
people of many other Latin
American countries will begin to
demand justice for themselves.

“Money for jobs! Not for
war! U.S. out of El Salvador!”
shouted marchers as they cleared
out of City Hall Park and wove

led by members of the Bread
and Puppet Theatre Troupe,
costumed as U.S. government,
the military junta of El Salvador,
and a Salvadoran peasant woman
with her children. At intervals
along the way, the theatre

troupe would stop and portray

the simple and horrible reality of
U.S. involvement. A rifle handed
to the soldier would be aimed and
fired at the peasant woman, who
would die with her baby in her
arms.

After the march, upwards of
100 people met at St. Joseph's
Church on Allen Street to
organize with members of
CISPES. Four committees were
formed to enable further pro-

gression actions already under
way. The education committee
is involved in outreach, primarily
through providing speakers, a
film titled El Salvador: Another
Vietnam and a slide show titled
El Salvador: Revolution or
Death to schools, churches,
community groups and anyone
else who is interested.

Another committee was
formed to organize buses and
publicity for a march on Wash-
ington taking place March 27.
This committee is supported
by fund-raisers who organized a
raffle to raise money in order to
cut the cost of bus fare to the
Washington march.

The petition committee is
soliciting at least 5% of Burling-
ton voters to sign a petition
calling upon the President and
the Vermont Congressional Dele-
gation to: (1) Immediately end
all military and economic aid to
the civilian military junta in El
Salvador, including the training
of military personnel in the
United States; (2) Immediately
recall all U.S. military advisers
presently in El Salvador.

to be ignorant of which cultures;
everyone knows Reagan’s name
worldwide, but how many of us
know who the president of
Senegal is? This kind of looking
for a rubber-stamp from govern-
ments, and not from the folk or
people, is a sad (but perhaps
genuine) reality. I would prefer
to stay ignorant of presidents,
popes, and other male honchos
of various societies, and begin
the process of learning cultural
awareness from the people.

Means criticizes Marxism as
a despiritualized European
dogma and points to its focus on
industrialization as the most
lethal part of its ideology.
I agree with this wholeheartedly,
although I became uneasy when
he lumped anarchists in with this
group of leftists in an article of
his appearing in Mother Jones
magazine in December 1980. I
looked at my defensiveness,
wondering if what he said was
true. I agree that most of anar-
chist theory/ideology that has
been written has been written
by white men... this has always
bothered me, and I have tried
not to rely on this material in
defining what anarchism is for
me. Anarchists don't want a
static “correct line” developed,
and don't aspire to educate the
“masses” about one or two
“or three men’s endless written
work. We want a social, not a
political revolution, and issues of
sex, race, and natural degrada-
tion of class and economics. Un-
told stories and “his story” once
again muddle and confuse... and
I seem to have strayed from the
topic at hand!

I guess I have found myself
being critical of some Native
American traditions as being
sexist, and yet I read Barbara
Cameron’s words (a Native
American writing in This Bridge
Called My Back) about a lesbian
white woman with similar
thoughts who interviewed her,
and she found this woman
nauseatingly racist. Again I'm
disturbed. Am I racist? I try to
consciously not be, of course.

THE UNIVERSE

although I have caught myself
using racist images in the past
and have been thoroughly upset
by this. When Off Our Backs
criticized the 1980 Black Hills
Survival Gathering as being sex-
ist, I agreed with them. I could
not understand the National
Women’s Health Network's not
attending because it was being
held in a non-ERA-ratified state,
since United States laws have
nothing to do with Native
American sovereignty (except as
lies and by way of oppressing
and dismissing), and since I
myself shun protective legisla-
tion as another pacifying scape-
goat that this government uses
to detract our rage away from
the real culprits. However, the
other criticisms of Off Our
Backs I saw as valid. They
included: the cancelling of work-
shops on self-help, abortion, and
lesbian health, a decision to
ban menstruating women from
the kitchen tent, and lack of
childcare.

Winona LaDuke, an Ojibwa
woman and activist, responded
to these criticisms by pointing
out the cultural importance of
the powers that women are in
touch with during their “moon-
time.” She says that “in awe and
respect for this power, women
have removed themselves from
ceremonies, and the society at
large.” And, while being a
supporter of the right to choice
in all cases, she also is wary of
abortions that have been “offered”
from a destructive society.
She seeks to liberate herself
from a society of white males...
“in mind, body, spirit and
economics.” She points out in
Off Our Backs:

“These technologies of birth
elimination are some which I
consider to be the most destruc-
tive of male technologies, created,
and often completed by
men. I ask the women — are
there no choices or alternatives
which we can remember or
learn? There are many natural
contraceptives and herbal abor-
tion-causing substances which
still afford women the right to
choose, but give us more control
over the action.”

Carol, another Native Amer-
ican woman, said that childcare
was probably not offered as a
“separate entity” since children
are considered “a naturally inte-
gral part of any gathering” and
“caring for them” is not an
activity that is separated from
any other. She also stressed that
children are seen as more of a
community responsibility so
that they do not become a
burden to the “biological”
mother, or to women as a group.

Winona also asks white
women to reject the stereotypic
sex-role images of Native Ameri-
cans presented to us in history
books and by white anthropolo-
gists. Having done this for the
most part, I still could not
obtain any reasonable answers as
to why lesbian concerns were
not discussed at the Gathering. I
also still see a big difference
between women “removing
themselves” from a situation
(the kitchen tent), and being
“banned” from it, which implies
that menstruating women are an
“other” and that they are not in
control of their own actions. I
still shudder when reading
accounts like that written by a
Native American woman, Bea
Medicine, that says, “My pater-
nal uncle... stated that marriage
by purchase was considered one
of the greatest and happiest
events in one's life.” I also cheer

for women (who) have challenged
sexism while valuing their
identity as Indians and other
aspects of Indian culture.

We must continue to chal-
lenge aspects of racism that we
see in each other, and we must
try to do this in a way that is
supportive of our efforts to
change and overcome the indoctr-
inating garbage that we have
been force-fed by a white male
society and school system. As
Winona LaDuke says, “...we
must talk about these things,
and I think that at last a discus-
sion has begun.”
