Mary Just Skinner Announces  
Bid for State Senate  

Montpelier attorney Mary  
Just Skinner has announced her  
candidacy for the Democratic  
nomination for the State Senate -  
from Washington County.  

In announcing her candidacy,  
attorney Skinner stressed the  
need for change in the State  
Senate. “The Senate should be  
playing a more positive role,”  
she said. “Rather than always  
reacting to House proposals, the  
Senate should be exercising  
legislative leadership.”

Skinner stated that energy  
issues would be a key concern in  
the upcoming session. “The only  
way we can hold down the cost  
of utilities over the long run,”  
she said, “is to begin planning  
for the future right now. The  
continuing failure by the State  
to do any energy planning can  
only lead to higher rates.”  

Skinner said that the greatest  
immediate threat of higher  
utility rates comes from  
Construction Work in Progress  
(CWIP) which would allow  
utilities to raise rates now in  
order to build future plants.  
“One of my first priorities in the  
Senate would be to work to  
outlaw CWIP in Vermont,” she  
declared.  

Skinner also said she would  
work for property tax relief and  
for greater equity in school  
financing. She also said that she  
had been encouraged to run by  
many women. There are at  
present only two women in the  
thirty-member Senate.  

Skinner has long been active  
in utility and legal matters in  
Washington County. She was a  
key lawyer in the long court  
battle over the purchased power  
and fuel adjustment clause. As a  
Special Assistant Attorney  
General she successfully  
appealed the PSB decision  
doubling the cost of pay phone  
calls without holding a hearing.  

She is a member of the  
Washington County Democratic  
Committee, the Central  
Vermont Business and  
Professional Women, and  
numerous other organizations.  
She and her husband Scott live  
in Middlesex and practice law  
together in Montpelier.

Newsbrief  

The anti-ERA sentiment at  
the Green Mountain Girls’ State  
was so strong that some of the  
delegates held the pro-ERA  
governor, Lynn Blaze of Barre,  
hostage in her room. When Blaze  
would not change her mind,  
several other women rushed her  
door to free her.  

Two hundred and eleven  
women were delegated by  

high schools to  
attend Girls’ State at Johnson  
State College in June. Girls’  
State is an annual conference  
sponsored by the American  
Legion, in order to give high  
school women political and  
parliamentary experience.  
Phoebe Morse, an attorney  
and the Deputy House  
Commissioner for the State of  
Vermont, spoke to the women  
at Girls’ State. She stressed the  
importance of women in the  
professions and the ERA. Julia  
Kunin of Burlington said the  
response to Morse was favorable;  
however, the majority of women  
at Girls’ State remained hostile  
to the ERA. Kunin stated that  
the women expressed concern  
about the drafting of women  
and new alimony laws that  
might be brought about by the  
ERA. Kunin felt that the women  
were making emotional  
assumptions about the  
constitutional amendment.  
Kunin said that the ERA was  
discussed by the parties during  
platform meetings. The ERA did  
not reach the House or the  
Senate because the short time  
allotted to the passing of the bill  
did not allow for the extensive  
debate which was brewing over  
the ERA. Kunin pointed out  
that two bills, one categorizing  
rape of the wife by the husband  
as a felony and the other, to give  
service to battered children,  
were passed by the Girls’ State  
legislature.
