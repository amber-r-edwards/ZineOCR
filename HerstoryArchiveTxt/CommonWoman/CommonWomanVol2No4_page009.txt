having loved men maybe too
well. (We know she divorced her
first husband in the 60s and had
a bitter court battle with him
about child support, which he
never did pay for their three
children.) She told us that the
first time a man ever mentioned
the word “penis” in her pre-
sence, she was in college — and
she immediately ran to the
nearest women’s room and cried
in shame and rage. Yes — there is
a lot of sexual repression to be
dealt with here. But why hasn’t
it been dealt with by now?
Where has Betty been all these

I am no model of sexual
liberation; I have known one
person in my life, in the Biblical
sense, and do not expect to

know another in that sense. Yet
I have grown and changed in the
past two years to the point
where I no longer think it
“disgusting” for one woman to
love another — in fact, I can see
where such love can be softer
and deeper than anything men
usually give to women. This has
happened for me in only two
years — what has happened to
Betty in the 15 years she has
spent in the movement? Has she
met no brilliant lesbians who
have impacted her philosophy?
Has she never been exposed to
women loving women in sweet,
unexpected ways?

Also: where has she been
that she thinks it is now time for
“Stage Two Equality: How to
Live With It, Work With It, and
Love With It” — the title of her
keynote speech? Whatever hap-
pened to Stage One? Does she
really think that we have attained
equality for women, and that
we are therefore ready for this
“Stage Two” where we spend a
lot of time freeing men from
their “masculine mystique” and

worrying about their fragile
egos? Women have worried
about men and their easily

deflated egos for thousands of
years. As far as I am concerned,
it is time for women to worry
about themselves and their own
egos — egos which have been
bruised and crushed by constant
stomping over the centuries. I am
not yet ready to say, “Okay,
I'm where I want to be, now let
me concern myself with the men
in my life who need help." I am
not where I want to be, and as
far as I’m concerned men can
take care of themselves for a
change. —

Betty Friedan has been
playing this one-note tune about
a “sex-role revolution” that
benefits men as well as women
for over 15 years. She keeps on
telling us that it is time to be
concerned about men, but the
timing is never right. How did
the women’s movement pass her
by? Why does she now seem like
that fossilized fly in amber I
mentioned earlier?

Hey, Betty, why don’t you
open your mind and heart to
what's really happening? We can
use your intellect, your passion
and your talent in the real
women’s movement, which is
still in Stage One — “How to
Save Your Own Life.”

Holism

Continued from Page 7

What then is, has been, or
can be the relationship between
Feminism and Wholism? I
believe that historically Femin-
ism is a major force in the world,
laying the groundwork for the
so-called New Age, a coming
period when our planetary com-
munity, or whatever is left of it,
learns to truly acknowledge its
basic unity and live in harmony
and balance with each other and
the elements. Clearly, for that to
happen, the systems based on
Reductionist, patriarchal think-
ing must give way to new forms.
Wholism is an “ism” emerging at
this point in time to help the
planet make that transition.
Female energy is crucial to that
transition, because women un-
derstand the rhythms of the
earth and the elements, the
power of community and shar-
ing. The Wholistic community is
crucial to that transition because
it sees the larger picture, and is
ultimately about transforming
energy for healing, or Wholing.

The implications for Femin-
ists are clear, to me at least. We
women, having learned so much
with and from each other, are in
a unique position to take the
next step and claim our leader-
ship in the evolutionary process
of our planet. That means
beginning to move out and share
what we know with larger
communities; communities that
may not be Feminist or even
Wholistic; communities of just
folks who want to live better but
don’t know how. That means for
all of us getting past our labels
and our jargon and all that we
have used to keep us separate,
and feeling safe in our separate-
ness. That means seeing the best,
seeing the light, seeing the
potential (fullness of power) in
all people, even if they don’t
agree with us, and helping them
discover and express those parts
of themselves even as we have
done that with each other.

My image is of women
facing inward in a tight circle,
then turning around to face
outward, shoulder to shoulder,
and slowly stepping out to bring
what they know to “them” out
there. That image came to me
one night at the Mill, listening
and dancing with Witch One and
many, many sisters. It was a
powerful night for me. I was

intensely aware of the power
and skills present in the room,
the more so since I know the
history and growth involved over
the last several years to have
gotten to this point, having been
an observer of or active agent in
the process of the claiming of
these skills for many of the
women there that night, as well
as for myself. Present in that
room was an amazing wealth of
information and experience
about how to live as a commun-
ity, how to support, love and
touch each other, how to
develop our innate skills, how to
raise our children, how to care
for our bodies, how to celebrate
the joy of living, how to move
through our feelings, how to
commune with our spirits, how,
as Peggy and Carol say in their
article, to experience a “unity in
diversity.” I believe the rest of
the world needs desperately to
learn those things, and it is time
to be sharing and teaching what
we know. We can no longer
justify keeping our wisdom to
ourselves, even though it may
feel safer. For the planet to
survive, we must all come out
from behind our labels and say
what we know to be true; listen
to the wisdom of others, even if
their ways are different than
ours; teach and learn with and
from each other with whom we
share a commonality if not an
exact fit.

When I left the Mill that
night I was excited. I had the
sense of an important new step
for women. Men need to learn
what we already know, and we
may need to be their teachers.
We need to learn how to be with
men, to come together without
losing our power, to feel our
oneness across gender lines.
Women are the carriers of the
Life force, and for the Life force
to prevail, whoever has it must
shine it out loud and strong. I
feel confident that herein the
Burlington area the strong Fem-
inist community and the emer-
ging equally powerful Wholistic
community can work together,
sharing information, energy,
money, projects, support and
other resources. I think our goals
are similar enough. I think we
cannot afford not to.

After all, if all is related and
nothing is random, we are all
here together in each other’s
lives for some purpose. My hope
is that we may discover and
move consciously toward that
purpose — together.

Co-opt

It, Love with It, Etc.” No one

can seriously think we have
achieved equality when so basic
a demand as the Equal Rights
Amendment has not even been
passed. This is the “you've come
a long way, baby” school of
co-optation. The statistics show
that women are doing worse
financially than they were some
years ago. This theme is an
inexplicable distortion of the
realities that women live with.

Reality in general was given
short shrift at the conference.
All of the workshops on hard
issues such as low-income wom-
en, child care, abortion (a crucial
feminist demand being systema-
tically destroyed by the organ-
ized church), battered women
had only a handful of partici-
pants. One workshop leader told
me no one came because they
were all off loving themselves
and there were several well-
attended workshops on that
theme. This is not simple, loving
oneself is a good thing and an
important practice especially for
women who have been so
trained to take care of everyone
else first. Putting oneself first
rather than church, state or
family is a potentially revolu-
tionary act. But if the definition
of self-love becomes as narrow as
it seemed to me at this confer-
ence, it lends the false hope of
individual solution to political
problems.

Est talks about self-love,
though it is a quasi-fascist
organization. To a woman inter-
ested in the cause of women,
loving oneself must include the
perception that no woman is
free, liberated or equal while
others are oppressed as women.
To be radical, loving oneself
must go beyond the idea of
treating oneself to the under-
standing that making a revolu-
tion is about love, about creating
a supportive environment out
of the death culture that now
exists. It is about unearthing and
embodying that unique self in
women that patriarchy has
crushed out. That self will
include rage as well as joy and
may be terrifying in the context
of a culture that has worked so
hard to obliterate the reality of
the female principle. I wish the
presentation of self-love at WWW
had that kind of wholeness.

After the Friedan speech
there were several women who
wanted to speak and they were
cut short because Betty’d had
enough. But Betty didn’t have to
be there and it would have been
more enlightening and empower-
ing if she had said less and other
women were given more chance
to discuss the issues. To give so
much say to one woman is to
recreate male hierarchy and star
systems.

WWW 2 did have its positive
aspects. For many probably the
best part of the weekend was the
Sweet Honey concert. They
were wonderful, powerful, poli-
tical and exciting. Lunches were

reasonable, healthy and tasty. I
enjoyed the chance to see
women’s artwork in the gallery.
One woman worked with dryer
lint, an amusing use of laundry
leftovers to form a pastel grid. I
also liked Cindy Hyers’ sewn
sculptures and some work by
Meg Walker and Catherine Hall.

I went to a workshop in
which women participated in
reading Jane Melnik’s play. The
play had a lot to say about a sort
of average woman who begins to
understand her oppression and
the kind of quiet resistance she
has been developing all her life.
This is a kind of strength many
women have, a daily struggle to
assert themselves. How many
burned dinners are acts of
resistance?

Sunday I went to a work-
shop on lesbian sexuality and
the politics of self-love at which
everyone seemed to be having a
great time, Linda Wittenberg and
Glo Daley were the facilitators.
Linda said that she used the
concept of self-affirmation as a
guide for making choices in her
life. Glo made the point that
lesbian relationships are between
peers and therefore stand a
better chance of being self-
affirming than heterosexual ones
which are intrinsically unequal
in this society. There was some
talk about not losing oneself in a
relationship, but little was ac-
tually said about lesbian sexual-
ity in favor of the theme of the
day, self-love. I had some of the
same qualms about too facile
definitions of that concept,
though less in this room because
I recognized so many of the
women to be highly politically
motivated and active. One
straight woman there said that at
first when her lesbian friends
had not seemed interested
enough in how her baby was she
was upset, but then she realized
they were more interested in
how she was and it felt really
good. Ageism and rage were also
touched upon and clearly both
could be gone into in more
depth, judging from the women
in that room.

I attended an open poetry
reading which I found very
moving. Hearing various women
give voice to their deepest
feelings in the form of poetry
seemed to be the kind of synthe-
sis of self-affirmation through
expression combined with grap-
pling with difficult emotions
that I had been looking for.

From there to the workshop
on running a woman for presi-
dent in the near future was quite
a change in mood. Louise Piche
and Ames Curtis were the
facilitators and some of the main
reasons for wanting to do it were
to gain power and to gain
knowledge of how to get that
power through the process of
attempting such a campaign.
There were varied opinions on
whether it should be attempted
through a third party or one of
the traditional ones. A woman
raised the issue of why do it at
all, what would it mean anyway?
There was a division of those
who believe in the electoral
process and those who don’t.
There was much debate over
whether it was possible to keep
one’s integrity as a feminist
and run for office or not. I
doubt that the women in that
group could have agreed on a
candidate or a process in time
for the next election. I do think
they would all agree that the
time for a woman to have such
an office is overdue and maybe
some were spurred to work for
women candidates locally,
