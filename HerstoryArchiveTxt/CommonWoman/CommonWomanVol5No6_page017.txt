..More on the Michigan Music Festival

By Paij Bailey

As a member of the
C.U.N.T.’s (Coordinators’ Union
Negotiating Team) I want to give
a report of our first meeting.

Our main task was to figure
out what we could and should
accomplish as a group, and come
up with an effective structure/
process. Here’s what we decided:
we are sort of a buffer or filter
between management (Kristi and
Lisa) and labor (Coordinators —
approximately 80). We will
solicit feedback about policy
issues and make recommendations
to K&L. We will also be
available to act as facilitators if
and when conflict arises. Our
scope is limited to policy and
does not include business.

Of course the question came
up — “How do we draw the line
between business and policy?”
And it is a fuzzy one but we
trust that commonsense will tell
us when policy directly and
adversely affects the business
and vice-versa.

“Who exactly should make
policy?” we asked, and came up
with this structure, which the
Festival leans towards already:
Coordinators of an area make
policy within their area. They
work autonomously, within bud-
get and principle guidelines as
determined by the needs of the
business. It means that we are
asking that co-ords be hired
early this year (by January most
positions will have been offered)
and that budgets will be set
early as well, giving plenty of
time for negotiation. Any poli-
cies that are particularly contro-
versial and/or will affect business
too much to be made in a
vacuum will not be just the
coordinator’s to make (e.g.
where to locate male childcare in
the event of new land). These
will be made based on feedback
from everybody and experience.

The big thing that came up
over and over again was account-
ability or — more specifically —
communication. What needs to
be radically different about the
Festival is how accessible infor-
mation is for everyone. We need
to be able to get concrete
answers to our questions about
expenditures, decision-making,
etc. We need to start asking the
questions instead of making
assumptions. We need to be clear
with each other. It was pointed
out that, with no exceptions
that we could think of, honesty
is the best policy. Women would
rather hear the truth, even if
they don't agree with or like it,
than get hazy, non-specific, non-
information. Specific ways that
we see to help are:

(1) A central information
bank, during the Festival, includ-
ing information that one person
has that someone else may need
(like where the tents go when
they arrive, or what's the current
headcount), a place for messages
for each other (co-ords), files for
receipts, a place where emer-
gency work crew needs are put
out, rumor control, etc. We see
it as mainly a resource for
coordinators, but centrally located
for access to participants, too. This
needs a highly organized, non-panic-stricken, creative coordinator.

(2) Orientation. On-the-land
orientation for everyone needs
to be more thorough. Michell
suggests that the wait for the
shuttle over in the parking lot
could be put to good use by an
orientation program. Besides the
basic facts (don’t shit in the
woods or lose your ticket stub)
women could stand to learn a
little of how the Festival works
and how important their work
slots are for everyone. A little
consciousness-raising. Festie-
goers need orientation, so do
co-ords, techies and performers.
Orientation is more than just
information-sharing.

(3) Coordinators could
stand to organize their areas
earlier. In some cases (e.g.
there are purchases
that could be made early, thus
saving money. Lists could be
gotten to inventory far enough
in advance to make bargain-
hunting feasible.

(4) A published overall
budget, broken down by area
into percentages (to protect us
all).

Onward... As far as specific
areas and issues go, we discussed
a few biggies but left most
detail-hashing to the co-ords in
question. Here’s what we talked
about:

* Hiring/Firing. Kris and
Lisa do the hiring and firing with
suggestions from anyone and
help if necessary from the
C.U.N.T.s. The issue was what to
do in the case of incompetence
and/or personality conflicts be-
tween co-ords. We talked about
people evaluating their own
performance, about whose job it
is to fire (K&L’s), about the
difference between not hiring
someone and needing to get rid
of them during the Festival. We
agreed that we can't make the
assumption that everyone who
wants a paid position will get
one. Coordinatorships will
involve some added respon-
sibility in terms of policy-
making and planning for next
year’s Festival.

* Childcare. We agreed that
we need a minimum of one
full-time co-ord each for male
and female childcare. Two for
each was suggested, or paid
assistantships, or work
exchanges (see next issue). Co-
ords are being asked for propo-
sals in a questionnaire. We have
the feedback from the Political
Tent to pass on to the co-ords in
question. We all agreed that this
area is one that needs much
more attention and priority. We
also agreed that the co-ords will
be the ones to work out propo-
sals.

* Work Exchange. We all
know that without the women
who work their butts off we
wouldn’t have a very easy time
of it. WWTMC's official policy
has been “No work exchange.”
This is because it is felt that
women who can’t afford to pay
full price for their tickets should
not have to work more than
everyone else. But we do need to
take time to develop a policy
which meets the needs of low-
income women as well as women
with access who come early and
stay late and work hard. We
talked about the need to cop to
the fact that we do have a work
exchange policy of sorts. But
we got bogged down on this
issue and still need to spend time
working it through. There is no
guarantee that pre-arranged
work exchanges would really
work, and what about those that
just show up? Kristie reminded
us that we all paid our dues, that
the Festival survives on volun-
teerism, that we need not feel
obligated to give tickets in
exchange for work. We need to
push for volunteers. Food might
be fair compensation for women
who come early and stay late,
especially since they are there
because they want to be, and
can be. We did decide to include
in the reduced-rate letter (which
gets sent to anyone who writes
and requests a reduced rate or a
work exchange) a list of specific
jobs that need filling (childcare,
shift supervisor, breakdown,
etc.) and tell women we need
these filled if they want to,
while explaining that they are
not under any obligation to
do more than the regular manda-
tory workshift.

* An issue we talked about
extensively was the backstage
area and the general feeling that
it is “extravagant” and “inacces-
sible.” It seemed to us that
mostly what we all need is access
to information about how it is
set up, how people that work
there are paid (and why), the
reasons behind the hiring of
performers, etc. If we have the
information, we won't have to
imagine the worst (and if we ask
the questions we may get the
answers).

* Security. We discussed
restructuring possibilities — maybe
a large paid or work-exchange
force to be a core corps that
would be available for a couple
of weeks around the Fest.
Again we are working out
a specific proposal to the secu-
rity co-ords.

* Land. Since there is a
separate committee to deal with
land, it is not our department.
Kris did, however, give us the
latest scoop on the land: they
have put a $2,000 retainer fee
on the “whiskey creek” land
(654 acres 25 miles NW of
Hesperia) and are in the process
of making an offer. The Land
Committee is researching the
most sensible way to structure
the business and the ownership
of the land and is getting lots of
new information from people
wise in those ways. A report will
be out shortly.

We will be meeting again in
January, hopefully with budget
to get down to the nitty-gritty.

So... now I await your feed-
back. Call (456-8865) or write
(P.O. Box 282, Plainfield, VT

tions, fantasies, ideas, thoughts.
