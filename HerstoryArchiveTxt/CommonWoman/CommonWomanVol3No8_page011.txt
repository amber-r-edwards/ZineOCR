WPS  
rebuttal  

Dear Editors,  

Jo Schneiderman takes  
some digs at the Women’s Party  
for Survival in her review on the  
Silkwood play in this issue, that  
are offensive to me, besides  
being based on mistaken  
opinion, and not fact.  

She refers to the group as  
“Pollyannaish.” For those of you  
who don’t know, Pollyanna is a  
character from a novel who is  
too good to be true. She thinks  
everything will be all right if we  
are good, well-intentioned, true-  
hearted, etc. I know of no one  
involved in the WPFS who  
thinks that radical social/political  
change will happen as easily  
as holding hands, saying “Women  
Unite!,” and seeing the world  
through rosy colored glasses.  
No, we're not the simpletons  
Schneiderman describes (without  
ever coming to a meeting or  
talking, to my knowledge, with a  
member) just because we choose  
to focus on fighting the military-  
industrial - governmental  
machine. Schneiderman seems to  
think that we’re politically naive  
because we don’t choose to  
focus on the issues she chooses  
to pursue. And I don’t think  
anyone who’s attended the few  
WPFS meetings there have been  
is into ignoring or denying the  
many ways women are oppressed.  
But because we’re working  
on the issues of militarism and  
survival (wanting, of course, to  
do more than just survive), the  
implication is that we're incorrect,  
misguided and stupid.  

I’m really pissed at the idea  
that I or members of the group  
are unaware of how the state  
does crack down on dissidents,  
including murder and genocide.  
I wrote briefly about FBI harass-  
ment of the Panthers in an  
article that was printed in the  
last issue of Commonwoman,  
entitled, “Ism Schism.” We are  
not unaware.

this year’s candle  

now that I can think of you again  

I remember how  

small and skinny you were  

looking around  
for fifteen years  

two months  

and twenty-six days  

with the wide blue gaze  
of life's apprentice  

until  
silly girl  

you asked for a ride home  

the defense attorney said  

you might have been flirting a little that evening  

well  
maybe  
just for practice  

or to make up for looking about eleven  

anyhow  

when you said  

NO  

it was such an affront  

the man killed you for it  

now that I can speak of you again  

I have been thinking  

people used to stand at the Lincoln Memorial  

to read the Viet-Nam  

casualty lists  
we  

should set up our own monument  
whether by Dinah’s grave  
or next to the dumpster  
where you were found  

all speaking our grief  

saying the names of our dead

it would take longer

ATROCITIES  

Raymond Assault  

John Raymond, 43, of  
Cornwall, has been accused of  
striking his wife and daughter in  
their home Nov. 8.  

State Police said Raymond  
had been drinking when he  
returned home and threatened  
Chalis Raymond, 40, and their  
daughter, Tina Marie, 16.  

The daughter reportedly  
climbed out a bedroom window  
and ran to her grandmother's  
home to call state police.  

Raymond pleaded innocent  
in Vermont District Court to  
charges of simple assault. He is  
believed to be back at home.  

Commonwoman is receiving  
accounts of Atrocities in the  
mail since I have stopped culling  
the names from the Burlington  
Free Press. Send us what you  
know. Please check your facts or  
cite your sources.

NO NUKES; OUR ANGER IS  
TURNING INTO RAGE; TAKE  
THE TOYS AWAY FROM THE  
BOYS. We chanted, we moaned,  
we shrieked, we sang. We  
imagined the Pentagon crumbling,  
we visualized it gone. We  
are furies and battleaxes capable  
of turning men to stone, and  
stone to rubble.  

MOURNING, RAGE,  
EMPOWERMENT, DEFIANCE  

We gather at three of the  
Pentagon entrances. At our  
entrance women, still doing  
theatre, wove the steps closed  
from railing to railing with long  
pieces of yarn, and continued  
weaving as the police broke the  
yarn. A little later, women made  
themselves the yarn, linked arms  
and blocked the passageway of  
many Pentagon workers. Over  
100 women were arrested in  
non-violent civil disobedience.  
They chose to be arrested. The  
police seemed patient, even  
friendly. Watching this peaceful  
demonstration I felt how close  
we were to violence. Quick as a  
trigger — a decision to tolerate  
our behavior, or beat us, gas us,  
shoot us. Their guns make our  
defiance powerful. We, women  
with puppets and banners. We  
are afraid for our lives, and we  
risk them to protest violence.  

We will not allow these  
violent games to continue. If we  
are here in our stubborn hundreds  
today, we will certainly  
return in the thousands and  
hundreds of thousands in the  
months and years to come.”  

Unity Statement, Women’s  
Pentagon Action  
WHO CAME?  

We were mostly a homo-  
geneous group. Young, white,  
physically agile, middle class  
women. On Sunday, a day of  
workshops, it was painful to see  
our whiteness — a continued  
reminder of how our feminist  
activities are still race and class  
oppressive. The unity statement  
for this action — the call to  
come, listed us in our variety  
(young and old, rich and poor)  
and did not say Black, Third  
World, Native American, and  
White. A coalition, an action of  
unity among groups cannot act  
in a united way without acknow-  
ledging our differences — which  
make us act differently, and  
with different priorities.  

We need to understand the  
kinds of racism that keeps Black  
and Third World women from  
white styled, white planned  
political activity. To establish a  
level of trust white women must  
learn about and support the  
immediate survival struggles of  
these women. We must under-  
stand as well that many working  
class women can’t relate to,  
don’t speak the language of  
many feminist actions and gath-  
erings.  

If we are making a women’s  
action we need to include all  
women. Include means to out-  
reach for planners as well as  
participants. Third World, elderly,  
physically challenged, working  
class women, women we  
continue to make invisible or  
give only token recognition.  
Including means in our out-  
reaching, by graphics depicting  
images of many different  
women, by advertising accessibility  
for physically challenged  
women, and elderly, by estab-  
lishing support systems for  
working class and Third World  
women. Accessibility means we  
can style our demonstrations  
conscious to acknowledge, and  
provide assistance for the physi-  
cal strain of a prolonged or  
vigorous march or demonstra-  
tion.  

We must also acknowledge  
the relative ease with which  
some women may leave their  
jobs, their children to travel to  
Washington and possibly get  
arrested. Within our communi-  
ties we should look at who’s not  
going, and make a decision, as  
part of being a participant, to  
arrange for, or stay home and do  
child care for four days so a  
mother can go, or pay travel  
expenses and a missed pay day  
of work for women without the  
money to go.  

Let’s make happen and  
validate as important many  
different kinds of resistance  
actions. We don’t have to go to  
Washington to be resisting; many  
women must resist just to sur-  
vive. There should be no differ-  
ent or better glory in being a  
warrior at the Pentagon than in  
our daily struggles. The Penta-  
gon is not the front line, we  
battle all around us. The Penta-  
gon action is only important in  
that it is part of a continuum of  
actions, in that it is one of the  
many, many singular and group  
resistances of our herstory.  

Don’t we NOW
