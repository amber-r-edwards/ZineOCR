Sarah Schulman is young,  
still sure of herself at 24, pro-  
bably closer to the audience and  
generation reading this paper  
than either Marguerite Young or  
Lizzie Borden who were profiled  
earlier in this series on women  
artists and their work: Bravely  
Led Lives. Sarah is a political  
writer in New York who covers  
labor and other issues concern-  
ing women for Woman News,  

one of Manhattan’s local  
women’s community newspapers, probably the best of  

them. I would call her a Lesbeat  
(Lesbian beatnik) who lives in  
LES-bo (Lower East Side Les-  
bian-bohemia). She does com-  
munity and street theatre too,  
and remembers the political  
energy of the 70s only through  
the eyes of others, in books; and  
has just finished an as-of-yet  
unpublished lesbian detective  
novel in which she incorporates  
much of her own political  
experience and theoretical views  
creatively into fiction. I inter-  
viewed Sarah one cold afternoon  
after a hike up several stories in  
my Vermont garb — boots, caps  

— not to a cabin on a hilltop but  
to a teeny shared two-room  
tenement apartment.  

We talked through smoke  
(she loves it) and over coffee,  
one of our shared consumption  
habits.  

Q: What made you decide  
to become a political writer?  

Sarah: Well, I fell into it. I  
went to a really traditional  
college, University of Chicago,  
where they told me that I didn’t  
know how to write and that I  
would never be a scholar. But  
then I started to work for  
Woman News as a way to pass  
my time and I really got into it.  
I started to imagine what kind of  
writing would be helpful. I  
wanted to find a way to look at  
issues that would have implica-  
tions for organizing. I’ve been  
doing that for three years now,  
every day writing a column for  
Woman News, and it has become  
my identity. It’s not that I  
wanted to become a writer.  

Q: It happened because you  
felt like you had something to  
say?  

S: Because I had a very  
supportive environment.  

Q: Can you describe that  
supportive environment?  

S: I grew up in NYC. I  
wasn’t used to having a neigh-  
borhood. All of a sudden there  
were a lot of people who recog-  
nized me, read my work, talked  
to me about it. Whatever it was  
that was holding me back wasn’t  
there anymore. I had an oppor-  
tunity to publish regularly, to  
raise questions as I wanted to  
and not feel that doing that was  
going to damage my reputation.  
I wasn’t held back by academia,  
or by publishing either, because  
I wasn’t being paid for it.  

Q: Do you feel like you get  
back, although you are not  
getting paid for it? That's not an  
issue for you?  

S: Oh, it’s a very big issue  
for me. I feel like there are  
writers who are gay, then there  
are gay writers, and that I didn’t  
make the decision to become a  
gay writer. I am completely  
ghettoized, although right now I  
am the most frequently pub-  

lished lesbian journalist as far as  
the feminist, left and gay press  
goes. I make no money from it.  
I have lots of useless clippings  
because I can’t show them to  
anybody. It is very frustrating.  
Which is why I am trying to do  
some fiction — trying to get  
some money.  

Q: I know also you are in a  
Jewish feminist support group?  

S: I was. For a minute. I  
have been doing research on  
radical Jewish women who lived  
on the Lower East Side at the turn  
of the century, most of whom  
were lesbians. I have been  
uncovering a lot of issues about  
sexual politics, prostitution,  
birth control. Even though I  
started to do some research  
under the auspices of Jewish  
institutions, basically they are  
sitting shiva for me. So I was  
looking for a way to bridge this  
Jewish-feminist thing. But it is  
hard because feminist scholars  
are territorial about their infor-  
mation. They don’t respect me.  
I don’t have a degree, I’m not a  
professional historian, meaning  
they won't give me a minute of  
their time. And they won't talk  
about anything until their books  
are published. And to me, this  
information I have about these  
women is vital. It doesn’t belong  
to me.  

Q: So you find the feminist  
scholars don’t have that kind of  
political energy?  

S: Zero.  

Q: Do you think there is a  
questioning and critical energy in  
this community?  

S: No. Jews have serious  
questions to face now. It’s not  
just having nice women shabbat  
services. I would like the Jewish  
feminist movement to be more  
political than that. Making con-  
crete decisions about how we are  
going to face relating as Jews  
during the Diaspora, what our  
relation to Israel is going to be.  
This involves people’s daily lives.  
If Jewish radicalism could be  
reborn with a feminist perspec-  
tive, that could be one of the  
best things that ever happened  
to Jews.  

Q: But do you find support  
for being intellectual and critical  
by having friendship circles that  
include Jews?  

S: Some. But not enough.  
Right now I would say there is a  
total separation between organ-  
izers and theorists in the femi-  
nist movement. A handful of  
people cross those boundaries.  
So when theorists are writing  
books they are clearly behind  
the times in terms of what the  
organizers are doing.  

Q: But doesn’t it take time  
to get books published?  

S: If they are getting their  
degrees off it, or publishing  
books on it... things like the  
Barnard conference. Every year  
they bring together all the  
feminist theorists in the country.  
But they never ask what are the  
implications for organizing. It  
could be very exciting, but  
instead it is very polarizing.  

Q: Can you talk a little  
about the time you spend on  
your work? Do you write every  
day, do you have rituals for  
getting into it? How do you  
organize your own structure?  
And how do you break your  
time down between short and  
long term projects?  

S: Because I write a column  
monthly about events, and book  
reviews, it just comes out of me  
in two drafts. Fiction is a  
different experience. Basically I  
steal more than I write. What I  
try to do when I fictionalize is —  
there are all these different  
stereotypes of women who have  
not been recorded in literature. I  
am trying to identify the cate-  
gories. There is the socialist  
feminist academic, who is  
heterosexual and very ambiva-  
lent about it; the left sectarian  
woman who completely denies  
any of her own experience  
because she needs to have a  
formula... all these people are  
interacting in a circus, in a very  
rich culture. It is my fantasy  
that New York Magazine will  
have a cover story on lesbian  
culture... and people from the  
suburbs will come to the Lower  
East Side to hang out with  
lesbians just like they did with  
the beatniks. And music, and  
film. There is so much happen-  
ing. So I am trying to make a  
commentary on it, to cover the  
world I live in.  

Q: Your lesbian fiction  
novel is set in this locale?  
S: Yes. Basically I am  
addressing all the same issues I  
am politically. I used to work in  
a reproductive rights organiza-  
tion and we believed in the  
concept of compulsive hetero-  
sexuality and we thought that  
any feminist politics had to  
embrace that.  

Q: The concept that came  
from Adrienne Rich, a few years  
ago?  

S: Yes. There was no room  
in that network for this, so we  
have been trying to create a  
theoretical integration, how to  
understand compulsive hetero-  
sexuality and its relation to  
reproductive freedom. Most of  
my theoretical work has been  
around that. And in fiction — I  
am trying to address the same  
question... the arbitrary separa-  
tion between heterosexual  
women and lesbians. In personal  
relations, and politically. And  
internally in one woman, like  
Lincoln, the house divided  
against itself. When I see women  
very conflicted about their iden-  
tities, I see this as tragic, and I  
am trying to find a way to get  
past that.  

Q: But the lesbian commu-  
nity promotes that separation  
also... excommunicating a  
woman who has an affair with a  
man...  

S: Yeah, but not mine.  
Bisexuality is no great sin,  
though I don’t want to discuss  
that. Most of the people I know  
die every day sitting in coali-  
tions, working with straight  
women’s groups. Basically our  
sexual categories are arbitrary...  
any work that doesn’t under-  
stand that is not speaking to the  
whole story.  

Q: Do you find yourself

AN INTERVIEW  

Q: Do you think having this  
motivating force that you have  
something to tell the world is a  
class view? How do you justify  
taking the time to write it?  

S: I find it very hard. I have  
two women that I am able to  
relate to. One is a lesbian, and  
one is a heterosexual, a psycho-  
logist...  

Q: You say these categories  
are arbitrary, but you use them.  

S: Of course it’s a class  
thing. I’ve thought about this. I  
was raised in an upwardly  
mobile Russian Jewish family.  
All the kids are gonna be pro-  
fessionals, whatever, Because I’m  
a lesbian that changed. I was  
floundering for a few years  
trying to find out what to do  
with my ambition. I still have  
the same ego ambition and class  
confidence that I had before.  
That could have gone into law  
school...  

Q: You have the same ego  
ambition, but because you made  
certain political and personal  
decisions, you have no outlet for  
it?  

S: It does take a certain  
outrage — I deserve this, because  
I’m from this class. Anger that I  
didn't get what I was supposed  
to get, what was promised me.  
So I am trying to do it this way,  
and see what will happen...  

Q: To write in this milieu?  
Isn’t that because there was a lot  
of energy when stuff came out  
and was new, and how it’s  
repetitive?  

S: Some of it. But some of  
the stuff by the Third World  
lesbians, Barbara Smith is an  
incredible feminist. Her work is  
great.  

For visitors to New York,  
try checking out the local  
lesbeat scene at the WOW cafe,  
330 E. 11th Street; or the  
Cloisters, an outdoor cafe on 9th  
St. between First and Second  
Avenue. You are likely to find  
Sarah reading her poetry or  
theorizing about her art, her  

community, and her political  

Q: How long did you work  
on your novel?  

S: A year. It’s about a  
lesbian on the LES, my age, 24. She was  
a child at the anti-war demos,  
and saw it with a child's view, and  
then tried to understand why  
women had doctrinaire left  
views. And she tries to under-  
stand why they became acade-  
mic. A typical category, undocu-  
mented. And one of the charac-  
ters comes from a working class  
family who ends up at Michigan,  
with all these rich Jews... had to  
do it, it was my therapy.
