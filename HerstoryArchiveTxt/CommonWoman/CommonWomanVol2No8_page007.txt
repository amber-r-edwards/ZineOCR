BOIDY ILAINGUAGHIE

It All Started in the Packer Room

By Lynn Vera

As one of six lesbians in my

immediate biological family
(four sisters and my mother) I
am often asked, and often

consider, what things in our lives
evolved us all into such wonder-
ful dykes. Now, a field hockey
official, I spend these fall
afternoons watching — strong
young womyn “play” that beau-
tiful skilled game. I watch with a
sense of love and respect; I
remember how intense it can
feel — the game, the relationship
with the other players, with the
coach. Such an energy can be
created, such a sense of trust and
pleasure among the womyn
playing. I remember how invol-
ved I was when I played, how I
threw myself into the playing,
the running, the communication
with the other womyn on
my team. I liked feeling so
strong; often I would put my
hand on my thigh as I'd run to
feel the muscles. I felt very free
and incredibly powerful, and at
the time nothing meant more
than the connection that hap-
pened while playing with the
team.

A team of strong, commit-
ted, serious young athletes,
womyn. As I watch, and remem-
ber, and recognize... the body
movements, the non-verbal com-
munication, the emotional invol-
vement, the facial expressions, I
understand in a new way how
important it is that these young
womyn are there, playing. They
take themselves very seriously,
their coaches respect the game
and the players, the officials do
the same.

I try to think about the
opportunities that young wom-
yn have to take themselves so
seriously, to feel respected and
validated and important. These
womyn have such a focus in
their days, a focus that is self, is
friend, is coach and team, and is
playing a complicated game skill-
fully with all the incredible body
strength, agility and endurance it
demands. They are responsible
primarily to be healthy, to make
their bodies strong enough to
endure the long sprinting, to
learn the game, to develop

were accessible to workers? The
authorities let us sit and let off
steam and it’s business as usual
for all concerned. The media
cooperate by distorting the
nature of the action — refusing
to acknowledge the weapons
focusing only on energy.

Opposing the financial
backers of nuclear weapons and
energy will not in itself change
the values and philosophical
assumptions of nuclear propon-
ents nor of the patriarchy. The
Wall Street Action was purely
symbolic. More bureaucrats and
politicians are hearing us, but
the Pentagon/corporate heads/
Church/et al continue to ignore
us. The peaceful protest route is
a long one, and it looks like time
is growing very short.

communication and closeness
with the other players... it’s
a more involved and intense
daily process than most “adult”
jobs. It is the main support
system for these womyn —
friendships among team mem-
bers of a sport are incredibly
inter-involved, tight, very inten-
se. Daily practices, games, week-
end practices. These womyn’s
lives become very similar for the
months of the season; they talk
about field hockey (not often
boys), about coaches, other
players... a lot revolves/evolves
around athletics.

waiting for the connection to
that six-dyke family? I am afraid
some to write that I am growing
more surely clear that a strong
connection exists between a
serious athletics program for
young womyn and the evolution
of self-loving happy lesbian
womyn. I fear writing it because
of the world’s homophobia, of
the school system’s homopho-
bia; fear and know that the
reality of young womyn con-
necting with the strength and
joy of all-womon spaces and
projects is not a cause for
celebration and pleasure among
a good part of the straight

world. My family, such a posi-
tive expression of strong womyn
joining each other in self-loving
choice, would be scorned by a
great majority of people, includ-
ing my father if he knew.

My four sisters and I were
all athletes. We took ourselves
very seriously, our “work” very
seriously, our connections with
the friends we played with
(spent up to five hours a day
with), and the coaches who
showed us how to grow physical-
ly stronger than we were sup-
posedly capable of. We grew to
respect our skill, to respect the
communication process we ex-

plored together. We supported
each other and grew strong,
some of us grew political,
through the discrimination,
financial and validatory, of the
administration and boys’ athletic
programs. It is that strength,
that proud self-respect, that
trust in the ability of womyn to
accomplish difficult tasks that
does not come easily to most
young womyn... it evolves in
serious young womyn athletes.
It evolved in me, and it found its
very sensible home in my lesbian
love and respect for womyn. I
had, my sisters had, the young
womyn I watch daily have an
incredible and open exposure to
womon strength, womon depen-
dence, womon sensitivity; I
seriously think that this allows
them to nurture and recognize
how special womyn are, how
wonderful it is to be part of an
all-womon environment, daily,
and creates a more real possibi-
lity of being womon-focused.

And yet I am sadly, realis-
tically very aware that so many
womon coaches and refs don’t
speak about this, don’t explore
this, because they probably fear
losing their jobs. Then the
positions would be filled by less
skilled womyn (womyn who
themselves probably were not
athletes and therefore themselves,
never had the intense
inter-involvement with other
womyn athletes), then womy,n’s
athletics could lose its finally
(almost) achieved recognition as
valid and important and skilled,
then these young womyn could
eventually lose this opportunity
to be so self-confident, strong,

and to take themselves so
seriously.
But I do celebrate the

reality of the connection I am
trusting, and I want to share it as
a cause for celebration. Womyn
working together is an intensely
beautiful and energizing process;
young womyn work together
through athletics. I grow increas-
ingly pleased.
