Atkinson said that we are
resisting the acceptance of this
reality, and that we must fully
comprehend the present before
we can challenge the future.

It was only too clear that the

focus, at least for the near
future, was to be on the
development of a political

strategy that would outsmart
our enemy while uniting women
worldwide towards a vast
societal transformation: from a
warrior society to a nurturant
one.

Gloria Steinem spoke about
feminism as a populist

movement that has changed the
fabric of society, but has just

our bodies, we are

begun the tedious work of
structural change. In the long
run, she said that we must seize
control of the means of
reproduction, and that every
woman we lose is one loss for
the future revolution.

Steinem was strong about the
necessity for passage of the
ERA, and many women spoke
of the fact that even as mild a
demand as the ERA could not
be passed without shifting the
balance of power away from the
male status quo.

Consider the fact that women

The questioning process
exposed inconsistencies in some
prospective jurors' responses.
Several felt that they would be
open to hearing additional
evidence before deciding guilt or
innocence. Other would-be
jurors admitted that the
testimony of a law-enforcement
officer would be respected by
them more than that of a
defendant or other witness, yet

still felt they could be impartial.

Still others felt Berster

“probably was” guilty. One

explained that he felt very
prejudiced because of
“flamboyant lawyers” and
conceded that he was not at all

impartial. The partiality of a
person who admitted having
read, seen and heard about

Kristina’s case in the mass media,

yet asked about the content of
those reports, said she knew
nothing but the charges read in
court October third was also
questioned. Some prospective
jurors may or may not have had
knowledge of the case, but they
expressed honest intent to be
fair jurors to the best of their
powers. One responded that she
did not believe that Kristina was
guilty of a crime. She had
conscientiously avoided any
exposure or discussion
concerning the case, knowing
that she might be called as a
juror.

On the second day of jury

Kate Millet provided some of
the most moving and stirring
moments of the day. She
announced that she had just
written an elegy for Sita who
had killed herself this spring.
Kate wondered at our failure of
community since Sita (in real
life an activist in the women’s

movement) had died so alone.
Confronted with Sita’s death,
Millet expressed a feeling of

obligation about living her own
life “harder.” She spoke of all
the changes we needed to make
with regards to sexual rights,
freedom for children, the idiocy
of modesty, the need to be
anarchist and alive at our own
risk! There was a cry for women
to hit the streets, which was
enthusiastically accepted by the
crowd of over 600 women who
attended.

Midge Costanza was full of
the devil, fresh from her
resignation as assistant to the
president, as she told us that the
women’s movement could afford
to laugh. “I met Phyllis
Schlafly,” she reported. “Of
course we all know that Phyllis
is the greatest female
impersonator in the country.”

“Of course we all
know that — Phyllis
Schlafly is the
greatest female
impersonator in the
country.”

Midge Costanza

selection several of the first

day’s jurors were challenged and
released. Their replacements
were examined. The judge's
questions seemed a great deal
more perfunctory and most
probing was initiated by counsel.
Once again there was pro-law
enforcement prejudice and
media influence.

The defense attorney can
“bump” twelve jurors without

cause (i.e. for prejudice or other
reason). These “bumps” are
based on feelings of insincerity,
sharp incompatibility of lifestyle
with that of the defendant, body
language or other reasons not
exposed through verbal
examination. These rejections
are permitted to ensure as fair a
jury as possible.

Wilmette Brown began her
speech with the one word:
POWER. She stated that she
couldn't separate her blackness
from her womanness, and she
was happy that at last we
women have learned to become
less judgmental in regards to
women in positions of power.

Elizabeth Schanklin,
co-founder of the Foundation
for Matriarchy Inc. and
coordinator of the forum,

reminded us that we live in a
society that has contempt for

women, a patriarchal warrior
society that “ex-procreates” our
children. “Our mothers give us

up to patriarchy, so we do not
learn to trust.” This contributes
to the hatred of women amongst
themselves, and she urged us to
be nurturing of each other and

to withhold life-giving energy
from men.
“The women’s
movement is the
struggle that our

mothers make in our

homes when they
produced us: the
daughters who are
fighting now!”

Wilmette Brown

After proclaiming that she
was a lesbian feminist, Jean
O'Leary, co-coordinator of the

national gay task force, told the

audience that backlash is
becoming brutal; but now the
“love that dare not speak its
name” is finally becoming
visible. She warned against
“lesbian baiting” — that an
attack against lesbians is an
attack against strong and
independent women in general.

There was a lot of support for
this group of women who were
vulnerable in letting the scars
from the 14-year-old movement

Ti-Grace Atkinson (standing) is applauded by the audience on her way to the podium. First show. They sometimes trembled

as they spoke, and hugged each

other as they left the stage.
There was an exception to the

rule of vulnerability, and in this

case, Flo Kennedy was the
exception once again as she
danced onto the stage

resplendent in her cowgirl hat
and funky New York lawyer
feminist garb. She didn’t waste
any time in telling us where to
put our energy: “Get the pigs,
not each other... We have to
fight. They are not about to give
you anything,” she drawled.
“You wouldn't change your
kid's diaper if she didn’t cry.”
The future depends on your ass,
and where it is. We are the
future, and what we are doing,
determines the future.

Flo is currently organizing
pickets at banks, and a suit
against Procter & Gamble. She
was quite aware of the fact that
the movement needs money, and
she is out to get it.

She then invited all of the
speakers and forum organizers
onto the stage and handed out
copies of the feminist prayer.

“Word to the Wise...”

I should have listened
to my girlfriends
but I didn’t understand
why I shouldn’t
walk them home.
Not until
I saw the spray painted
tar hill behind the medical center
“Jap & Tony, Jap and Eddie,
Jap & ...” just about
every boy in our class.
It wasn’t so hard
to figure out Jap was me.
There was no one else

in our class.

A Change of Course

after the cold spell of many years
you came and touched my soul
warmed me with your fiery eyes
I melted

flowing in and out of you

a river changes unnoticed,
slowly, with much labor
a new course is formed

we must not lose faith in rivers

Remember

we all live
within the enemy’s camp

we sleep in enemy occupied
territory

we move silently
among them
like dead volcanoes

one day
together

our lava of rage
will burn them
