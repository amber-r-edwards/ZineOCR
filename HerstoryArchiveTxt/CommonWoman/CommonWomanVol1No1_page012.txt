Rich Dreams  

By Julie Orvis  

The Dream of a Common  
Language  

Adrienne Rich  

W. W. Norton  

$2.95, 74 pages  

Adrienne Rich compels us to  
think and feel her poetry — to  
participate with her in her life  
and art. Poetry here takes the  
so-called thought/felt process to  
its limits where life and art are  
unified.  

Ms. Rich delves into  
relationships between women to  
find her life and her art. As we  
read we are moved, literally, into  
that space she has created with  
words because it is our space.  
She has captured the space that  
the poet and reader share,  
molded it and collected a series  
of metaphors that ring through  
us. She quotes a woman: “Now  
we are ready/ and each of us  
knows it. I have never loved/ like  
this. I have never seen/ my own  
forces so taken up and shared/  
and given back.”  

We are engaged by Ms. Rich's  
“dream of a common language.”  
We feel her pain when her  
poetry is “crucified” or torn  
apart as a literary endeavor.  
Poetry is crucified when it is  
separated from life. The  
emotional movement of the  
poems is lost in the academic  
critical reviews. This crucifixion  
brings to Ms. Rich the “dream of  
a common language.” The  
common language is the  
evolution of the space  
transforming life and art into  
one. Life is art in this “whole  
new poetry;” a separation  
between life and art makes no  
sense here. The relationship  
between women is the poetry  
itself.  

Ms. Rich has seized women’s  
power. At first she shows the  
denial of that power by the  
individual, struggling alone as  
did Marie Curie. The source of  
her power was the cause of her  
death. The metaphor of Curie’s  
power is juxtaposed with a poem  

climbing team who died in a  
freak storm. These women  
brought their individual dreams  
together to form a new poetic  
community. This community is  
the experience of the bonding of  
sisters. These women take the  
ultimate risk of death to reach  
for their dream of the summit.  
At their death one woman writes  
in her diary, “What does love  
mean/ what does it mean ‘to  
survive’/ A cable of blue fire  
ropes our bodies/ burning  
together in the snow. We will  
not live/ to settle for less. We  
have dreamed of this/ all of our  
lives.”  

Women painfully evolve in  
these poems. We are miners who  

dig into the earth. In mining we  

act out the work of our new  
inner awareness. Women are also  
like the blind walking down the  
street with their sensitive canes.  
We are still half-born. Women  
are our friendships. These poems  
take up that friendship and  
portray it as a dynamic  
reevaluative process of the  
evolution of women’s art and  
lives.  

Out of the chaos and  
formlessness of the female world  
Ms. Rich finds form but not  
without feeling the fear and pain  
brought on by that formlessness.  
Ms. Rich dives into the  
far-reaching fantasy that the  
chaos holds in it as potential  
(this the half-born woman). And  
it is in this chaos that life and art  
are unified. Ms. Rich writes:  
“Visions begin to happen in such  
a life/ as if a woman quietly  
walked away/ from the  
argument and jargon in a room/  
and sitting down in the kitchen,  
began turning in her lap/ bits of  
yarn, calico and velvet scraps,/  
laying them out absently on the  
scrubbed boards/ in the  
lamplight.../ Such a composition  
has nothing to do with eternity/  
striving for greatness, brilliance/  
only with the musings of a  

about a Russian woman’s mind/ one with her body...”
