The collective of Everywoman’s Place has spent several months rewriting its statement of  
purpose. We have arrived at the following draft. If you have any comments or suggestions,  

please write them in below and leave at the center or send to EWP — Everywoman’s  

Everywoman’s Place: Statement of Purpose  
wl Sg Msin- Se, Burlington,  

Everywoman’s Place is organized for the purpose of creating and providing a community  
women’s center that will enhance the positive growth of and support the human rights of all  
women from every background, color, occupation, lifestyle, physical ability, political and  
sexual identification, and geographic region. The center will provide space, service, information,  
referrals and feminist support in a social, emotional, educational, cultural, political, and recrea-  
tional context. Everywoman's Place is dedicated to meeting the needs of women by remaining  
receptive at all times to change.  

Suggestions:

CHILDCARE is available for some programs sponsored by Everywoman’s Place. Ask for  
childcare by calling EWP no later than 3 days in advance. We would like to increase our  
ability to offer childcare for all EWP events. If you can help, please call us.

STAFFING: We need more volunteers to staff the center this winter. If you are inter-  
ested, please call EWP, or Mary Bentley at 864-4594.

PROGRAM: We always need program ideas. If you have suggestions or wish to offer a work  
shop call EWP, or Pat Metevier at 863-5006.
