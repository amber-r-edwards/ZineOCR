Karen Silkwood wasn’t

raised to be a radical. Born in
Nederland, Texas, where women
are “ladies,” she married a boy
who promised escape. But after
three kids, he escaped from her,
marrying her best friend and
taking the children. A return to
Texas was unthinkable, so she
moved to Crescent, Oklahoma,
and applied to Kerr McGee's
training program to be a techni-
cian. What looked to Silkwood
to be life’s best opportunity
instead exposed her to corporate
corruption, health hazards, fear
and ultimately death.

Silkwood is a play about her
life. Written by Jehane Dyllan,
Susan Holleran and Bobbi Ausubel,
and performed by Jehane
Dyllan, it is thoroughly
researched, poignant, powerful,
angering. The one-woman show
is set at a OCAW (Oil, Chemical
and Atomic Workers) Union
meeting, the same evening that
Silkwood was murdered in a
“mysterious” car crash while
delivering an incriminating file
on Kerr McGee to the NY Times
(The file has never been
recovered).

Dyllan employed a dramatic

use of Silkwood’s early arrival

to the meeting, to introduce us
to Karen Silkwood, a working-
class woman, who refused to
give up her fight to protect her
fellow workers. We meet her
boyfriend, other union organi-
zers, her sister workers. We
watch her growing consciousness
as we learn of her experiences
with health hazards, battles with
Kerr McGee, disillusionment
with the AEC, personal prob-
lems, and finally of her poison-
ing. (Plutonium was found
planted throughout her house,
even in a bologna sandwich
which she ate. Kerr McGee may
still be making faulty fuel rods
and exposing workers to radia-
tion, but they did lose a sizeable
lawsuit for having irradiated
Silkwood so thoroughly before
they killed her.)

Jehane's performance was
stunning. She was concentrated,
energetic, captivating. For 90
minutes I was bound up in the
horror and the drama of Silk-
wood's life. In addition to being
an accomplished actress, Jehane
has a similar background to
Silkwood. She, too, is from a
southern working-class family,
and has worked in factories. She

witnessed her grandmothers—

incapacitation from brown lung
disease. Motivated by a desire
to educate and organize, she
helped form Union Sister Pro-
ductions, a theatre company
which is writing and producing
plays about real working
women’s lives.

Silkwood is based on actual
fact, but Jehane chose to tone
down and omit certain things in
order to make Silkwood more
empathetic. According to
Jehane, Silkwood was “a real
mess” toward the end — taking
drugs, chain smoking. She does
down some pills and smokes
nervously in the play, but the
woman we see is more in control
than Silkwood actually had
been. Jehane also omitted Silk-
wood’s sexual liaison with a
woman, and when she explained
after the performance, that it
had been a menage a trois with a
man, I was glad she did.

I was less glad, however,
about the emphasis on hetero-
sexuality which predominated
the performance. Jehane ex-
plained that Silkwood was
definitely not a feminist, and
that her experimentation with
sexual freedom was part of her
discovery of her own power. She
admitted that it may have been
overdone, and promised to tone
it down.

This is a minor criticism,

“Having access to tools and
knowing how to use them is
obviously a necessity in fixing a
car. Equally obvious — at least
to us — is how most of us have
grown up never having a tool in
our hands... And so here we are,
all ready to fix something on our
car, and becoming more and
more frustrated at our inability
to use a tool without feeling
awkward, clumsy, and complete-
ly uncoordinated... It takes time
— you can’t learn in a few
hours or days what men have
had their whole life to learn. So,
it might take you a while longer
to do something and you might
drop a tool or hit your hand, but
you will learn...”

The Greasy Thumb Auto-
mechanics Manual for Women
(GT) is for the woman who
wants to learn something about
how her car works, how to
maintain it, how to fix at least
some things, and how not to be

taken advantage of by
mechanics.
GT is divided into three

parts: Part 1, Tools and Theory,
goes over all the tools you need
to work on a car, plus some tips
on how to use them. Also,
explanation of how a gasoline
engine works, and identification
of the visible parts of the car—
both in the engine compartment,
and underneath the body. Each

system of the car is
explained and illustrated: fuel,
electrical, lubrication, cooling,
and exhaust.

Part 2 is on Repairs. Em-
phasis is on routine maintenance
and common general repairs.
Each repair is divided into —
symptoms, ways to check, and
how to repair.

Part 3, Troubleshooting,
covers typical car problems (e.g.,
engine runs rough, won't start,
oil leak, no lights...) Each
section is written with explana-
tion, step-by-step instructions,
and clear illustrations. GT also
has an extensive glossary, and
index.

The book is useful, reading
cover to cover, for a woman —
supportive source of general car
information; it is also useful for
on-the-curb specific instructions
on diagnosis and repair.

Thanks to the IOWA CITY
WOMEN'S PRESS for publishing
a useful and supportive how-to-
manual for women. A compan-
ion manual, Against the Grain:
A Carpentry Manual for Women,
is also available. Both are spiral

Review: Michelle Cliff, Nov. 6,
1980

By Consuelo Quinones

When we heard Michelle
Cliff was coming to Burlington
to read from her new book,
excitement rose — a Jamaican
lesbian coming here! We imme-
diately arranged with Perse-
phone Press that Ms. Cliff would
meet with the Third World
lesbians of Burlington.

The word was out and a
casual get-together was formed.

After meeting Michelle, I
must admit, I was set back a
moment when I saw a Black
woman encased in a white
woman's body. During that
moment a thousand things had
run through my mind. But only
one thought remained: Michelle
Cliff was a sister. Barriers
disappeared. The rest of the
evening is herstory, filled with
laughs, revelations, love.

Speaking to an audience
predominantly white, Michelle
Cliff read excerpts from her
book Claiming An Identity They
Taught Me to Despise, where I'm
sure many women had not
expected what they had seen.

As she read parts on Passing
and discussed the changes people
— white people — go through
when confronted by her Black-
ness, I knew the same changes
were happening in the room.

Passing, another example of
the use or abuse of white privi-
lege, and how one woman deals
with her identity in this white
supremacist world, is what this
book is about.

But how do other women
deal with their white privilege in
this world? Do they deny it in
defense of their black sisters? Do
they take this privilege to get
places that they can change the
oppression of racism, of their
sisters? Or do they cling to
oppression in resistance to
change?

Questions. Questions

women, white women, political
women, must answer for them-
selves who are combating for
change. Changes that are needed
for the completion — unification
of a sisterhood that has started.

In times like these where
racism is a definite issue, this
obstacle, based on color of skin,
language that is spoken, those
physical characteristics that
make us separate.

But is Michelle Cliff differ-
ent — separate from herself.
Separate from each of us.

Her claim is a brave one, a
daring one, a just one. Her book
is one that should be read by all.
And lesbians alike.

And when we sit around the
fire pits this winter let us not
repeat the discussions that
followed the reading that dealt
with everything except the
racism of this society and the
white privilege that is infesting
the women’s communities
around the country.

And deal with what
Michelle Cliff calls — CLAIMING
AN IDENTITY THEY
TAUGHT ME TO DESPISE.
