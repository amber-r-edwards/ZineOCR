m tion of the mind. “The mind is a

© terrible thing to waste,” yet no

‘\ matter who you are or what you
do it’s guaranteed that your
mind is being wasted. Wasted on
worry.

In this era of Reaganomics,
worry has become an ever-
present inhabitant of our minds.
With government programs being
slashed left and right it’s becom-
ing a losing battle trying to make
ends meet. You might as well
forget about looking to the
government to help put you or
your offspring through college,
or assisting you in obtaining
such luxuries as food or ade-
quate housing, nor will the
government be there to provide
aid to the elderly or
handicapped. Our government is
turning its back on us folks. It’s
taking money from us in the
form of taxes and when we want
retribution in the form of
adequate social programs to
meet the needs of all members
of society, our public officials
stare at us bluntly and laugh.
Uncle Ronnie tells us, “You
don’t need the Food Stamp
Program or Social Security bene-
fits, what you need is a strong

- viable Military to protect your
inalienable rights.”

Government atrocities are
not the only cause of worry.
Society is taking a very drastic

REVOLUTION

swing to the right. If you enjoy
good sex or good drugs, watch
out, cause the Moral Majority is
“gonna get your mama” and
damn your soul to hell. That
infamous terrorist group whose
members hide behind white
sheets is on the warpath again,
openly recruiting in the New
England area. Basically, the
whole world seems to be in utter
turmoil, consequently filling our
minds with the most devastating
and threatening worry of all: the
threat of Nuclear War!

Revolution is defined as the
overthrow or renunciation of
one government or ruler and the
substitution of another by the
governed; an activity or move-
ment designed to effect funda-
mental changes in the socio-
economic situation. Therefore, is
it not time for revolution? Is it
not time to stop the ruling class
of politicians from making our
decisions, decisions which aren’t
being made in our best interests?
Does our socioeconomic situa-
tion not need to be changed?
Yes it does, and this change does
not have to be brought about
with bloodshed or savagery so
common to revolutions of the
past.

“We the People of the
United States, in Order to form
a more perfect Union, establish
Justice, insure domestic Tran-
quility, provide for the common
defense, promote the general
Welfare, and secure the Blessings
of Liberty to ourselves and our
Posterity, do ordain and estab-
lish this Constitution for the
United States of America.”

Americans have been brain-
washed to see government and
its political soldiers as an over-
whelming, unchallengeable, al-
mighty institution. They have all
the money, they make all the
decisions, therefore they have all
the power. Hogwash! It’s not
their power that governs and
controls our lives but the power
of their force. They have the
militia, police, penal and mental
institutions at their disposal to
“forcefully correct” anyone that
steps out of line. In fear of being
subjected to this governmental
force (not power) we become
submissive and passive, believing
we must obey and bow down to
this powerful entity, never rea-
lizing that it’s governmental
force that we fear, and not
governmental power.

Ironically, the power of
government is technically sup-
posed to be in our hands, but it
seems the purpose of democracy
is to make people believe they
are governing themselves, while
not actually allowing them to do
so. Voting further perpetuates
this principle. We vote and elect
someone into office. Once that
person gets there she/he seems
to rarely know or care what we
want or how we feel about the
issues. It’s unlikely that any
politician has ever called to ask
your opinion on any given topic.
So how can it be said that we
govern ourselves? The truth is
that we elect people to govern
for us and in the process we end
up being governed by them. As
far as World Affairs are con-
cerned, we have absolutely no

say whatsoever. How many of
you approved the Shah’s asylum
in the U.S.? For that matter,
how many of you approved or
even knew about the U.S.’s
involvement in the Shah’s reign
of terror in Iran? But alas, this
is a Federal Republic, we live in
a democracy with a government
of the people, for the people, by
the people. Double Hogwash!

We the people of the United
States make up her power, not
the government. We make up her
force, not the government. We
make up her strength, but have
allowed the government to
divide and conquer us so that
our strength has turned into
weakness. Where would Ameri-
ca’s strength be if all the men
refused to go to war? Where
would America’s strength be if
all the women decided to birth
no more babies or not give up
any “leg” at all until the men
straightened out the mess
they've made of the nation?
Where would America’s strength
be if we stopped hating each
other and sincerely wanted what
was best for everyone, not just
ourselves? Let’s start fighting for
programs that don’t help some
and hurt others, but that benefit
us all. I want a revolution where
people say, “this is ‘our’ coun-
try, and ‘our’ government should
look out for us all.”

I want to start a revolution!
Revolutions start in the mind.
Your mind. Stop accepting and
start rejecting policies that aren't
for the general good of society.
Question policies and laws that
enhance governmental power,
making it easy to use its power
of force against us. And above
all, don’t be afraid to act. The
revolution cannot be violent
because the militia might not be
on our side. Think revolution,
feel revolution, but act carefully.

Write letters to those offi-
cials you put into office and let
them know how you feel. When
you're not satisfied with the
results, start your own personal
campaign to ensure that she/he is
not re-elected. Don't leave your
children’s education up to the
system because the system fills
young minds with lies and
myths. Show them the way it is
and then teach them the way it
should be. Most importantly, we
have to start coming together
as one. You aren’t any better
than anyone else and no one is
better than you. So Communi-
cate! When you feel something is
wrong, talk about it, write about
it, maybe other people feel the
same way too. We have to
un-alienate ourselves from each
other because we are all we have.

The government needs us
more than we need it. As long as
it turns its back on us we have to
work on coming, standing, and
fighting together to make it
focus on us again.

I want to start a revolution!
And one day I will! I hope you
will too!

(DISARM the U.N.
“SECURITY”
COUNCIL

On June 14th, a blockade is
planned of the five Nuclear
Missions who are permanent
members of the United Nations
Security Council. The emphasis
of the blockade will be at the
United States Mission, with
blockades also planned for the
French, British, Chinese and
Soviet Missions. These missions
represent their respective govern-
ments at the United Nations
while continuing to try to justify
their supposed need for nuclear
weapons in order to maintain
world peace. The Civil Disobe-
dience Campaign has developed
the following demands for the
blockade:

Recognizing that the people
of the world can no longer
afford the luxury of endlessly
discussing how or when to stop
the arms race, we declare that
disarmament must now go
beyond talk to action; therefore,
we demand that every country:
disarm unilaterally, starting
with nuclear weapons;
stop proliferation of nuclear
weapons by dismantling
nuclear reactors;
redirect resources from the
military to meet human
needs;
not intervene militarily in the
affairs of other countries;
announce at the Special
Session on Disarmament
—a significant step to be
taken immediately towards
disarmament;
—a plan to dismantle
nuclear weapons and dis-
pose of nuclear wastes.
Handbooks are available and
non-violence training sessions are
being planned for the Burlington
area. Please contact Megan Sond-
heim for more information at

on Feminism and Non-Violent
Direct Action is excerpted
directly from the handbook
for this blockade:

Feminism
By Ynestra King

Many women see their
oppression as political, not indi-
vidual. Over the past 10 years
women have begun to rediscover
our history, and to name and
work to end violence against
women in all its forms, demand
equal rights, the rights of every
woman to decide when and if to
bear children, and to express her
sexuality freely.

We are a beginning, for this
decade, but we continue the
work of the many brave and
visionary women who have gone
before us. There was Ellen
Swallow, the founder of ecologi-
cal science. There was Rachel
Carson, who wrote Silent Spring
20 years ago sounding a warning
about chemicals and pesticides
which were not heeded until
many years later. There were the
women of Women’s Strike for
Peace and the Ban the Bomb
movements of the Fifties, mail-
ing their baby’s teeth to Con-
gressmen as a reminder of future
generations. And there are the
brave women scientists who
have spoken more recently and
the women who have been at the
forefront of the anti-nuclear
struggles, the peace movements,
struggles against toxic wastes
and for occupational health and
safety. There are those who have
helped us to imagine the world
as it could be — artists, poets,
writers, and dreamers who have
given us new visions of culture,
health, technology, community
and politics. We are shaking the
world.

We oppose war and we
recognize its terrible face when
we see it, undeclared but all
around us. For us war is the
violence against women in all
its forms — rape, battering,
economic exploitation and inti-
midation — and it is the racist
violence against indigenous peo-
ples here in the United States
and around the world, and it is
violence against the earth.

The story of Love Canal,
where a school and homes were
built on a hazardous waste site, 
is a harbinger of things to come.
Three to six nuclear bombs are
produced each day. The Penta-
gon nuclear arsenal now num-
bers over 30,000 warheads and is
growing. There are thousands of
toxic waste dumps around the
country that won’t be discover-
ed until observant women notice
a common birth defect or
sickness in their neighborhood.
The coastlines are deteriorating,
and the Amazon forest, the
source of much of the earth’s
oxygen, is being rapidly defolia-
ted. Each day a whole species of
life becomes extinct, never to be
seen again on this earth.

We believe that a culture
against nature is a culture against
women. In pursuing projects of
violence men deny and dominate
both women and nature. It is
time to reconstitute our culture
in the name of nature, peace and
freedom, and it is women who
can show the way. We must be
the voice of the invisible, of
nature who cannot speak for
herself in the political arenas of
our society, of the children yet
to be born and of the women
who are forcibly silenced in our
mental institutions and prisons.
We have been the keepers of the
home, the children and the
community. We learn early to
observe, attend and nurture.
Whether or not we become
biological mothers, we use these
nurturant powers daily as we go
about our ordinary work. No
one pays us to do this. If child-
ren are born deformed or go
hungry, if the homes built on a dumping site or
the people in near a nuclear weapons site have
terrible sicknesses, we are the
ones who care for them, take
them to the doctor, console
survivors, and soothe the terri-
fied. Our feminism grows out of
hope and fear — out of a fear for
life and the awesome powers of
destruction arrayed against it
and out of a hope — a hope
for women’s power to resist and
create.

In all our workings we
believe in the philosophy of
nonviolence — that no person
should be made into an “other”
to despise, dehumanize, and
exploit. Sexism, racism, class
divisions, homophobia and the
rape of nature depend on this
process of objectification. We
see the devastation of the
earth and her beings by the
corporate warriors and the
threat of nuclear annihilation by
the military warriors as feminist
concerns. It is the same mascu-
linist mentality which would
deny us our right to our own
bodies and our own sexuality,
and which depends on multiple
systems of dominance and state
power to have its way.

Men’s fear of women’s sex-
uality has created institutions
that limit women’s options.
These keep us obligated to men
and unaware of alternatives
to traditional women’s roles and
compulsory heterosexuality. It is
in the interest of all women to
support lesbian women. We
