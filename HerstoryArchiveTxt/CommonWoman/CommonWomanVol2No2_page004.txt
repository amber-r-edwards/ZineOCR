It is significantly important to maintain an open mind and understanding in matters concerning sexual health and pleasure.

Good vibrations are

Is your love life on the
rocks? Are you tired of candles,
handles, and assorted fruits and
vegetables? Fingers not enough
anymore? Get a vibrator! See
what the wonders of modern
technology can do for you.

Point one: a vibrator is not
a penis substitute. Some vibra-
tors, in fact, are not even penis-
shaped. A particularly nice
model, made by a company
famous for its TV sets, is round
— about apple-size. You can
satiate mind and body simul-
taneously by masturbating to
“Evening at Symphony” or even
“Vermont Report.” Masturba-

ting through a State of the
Union message is a once-a-year
experience not to be missed.
Of course, masturbation is good
for you anytime, so don’t wait
for an excuse; do it now!

Point two: a vibrator is not
a lover substitute, although
there’s nothing wrong with
preferring a vibrator. You can
use it with two people. You or
your lover/husband/wife/pet can
lie on it or under it or you can
place it between the two of you.
Really kids — use your imagina-
tion. It can also help you keep
going when you're getting tired.

PANDORA'S BOX

By Polly Prim and
Priscilla Mum

You should probably put
something between you and the
vibrator, like a nice soft blanket,
as the vibrator might be too
harsh. Using a vibrator is a good
way to learn what pleases you -
where and how long you like to
be touched. It can help you
learn things you might like to
try out with a lover. Instead of
alienating you from your body,
technology can introduce you to
it.

Point three: some people
think your fingers will atrophy
and fall off from lack of use if
you do it with a vibrator. Not
true. Fingers will never go out of

style. They are, after all, port-
able, extremely lightweight and
sensitive, very affordable, and
always ready for use. You never
have to worry about packing
them for a trip.

Point four: although this
news may surprise some people,
technology is not inherently evil.
Technology in the form of
washing machines, cars, running
water, stereos, etc. is an integral
part of our everyday lives. We
have yet to meet a truly evil
refrigerator, although we've seen
some pretty wicked blenders.
Remember that — familiarity
breeds nostalgia. History's new-

fangled contraption is yester-
day's necessity and tomorrow's
quaint antique. So in 100 years
time instead of using their
anti-matter powered ever-ready
orgasmatron, people will be look-
ing around for a battery charger
to plug in the neat antique
vibrator they just bought. This is
called going back to nature.

Human beings make
choices. If we find that vibrators
are really alienating us from our
bodies (personally, we are not
convinced that this happens — in
fact, the opposite occurs) then
we can choose not to use them.

How many women think of
ourselves as goddesses? The
word resounds with the impos-
ing imagery impressed on us by
the idea of “gods;” we must
separate the two, reclaim the
word, or make a new one.

Before the onslaught of
patriarchal religion, there were
many co-existing, co-celebrated
gods and goddesses. The people
were not made in the image of
the goddess, but rather the other
way around. Goddess images
were imitative and representative
of women, and were as varied
both in physical appearance and
daily occupation as the women

themselves. There were god-
desses of weaving, cooking,
healing, childbirth, and goddesses
often were celebrated for
more than one of these, just as
the women themselves.

The concept of goddess did
not come to mean “other” until
the patriarchy — before that,

Ye Goddesses

By Lynn Vera

goddess celebration was self-cele-
bration. Throughout Mexico
and the Yucatan, thousands of
small clay figurines, mostly all of
women, have been found in
layers of earth sediment dating
them back thousands of years —
these clay figures proudly resem-
ble the women who made them
in their diversity of body type,
clothing (though most are
naked) and activity. It is thought
that each woman had such a
figurine, a constant celebration
and connection to the female
principle, the goddess internal-
ized. (I just flashed on how
many Christians used to, or still
do, wear or have in their homes
crosses — such a contrast in
concepts, such loss of self.)
These clay figures, used in ritual
and kept as talismans, illustrate
how personal and internalized
(external only in the sense of
other women, not deity) the
essence of goddess was.

I think that the whole
concept of self as goddess
encouraged and celebrated
difference and diversity. I
believe that patriarchy created
a hierarchy based on judging
those differences and naming
some better, others worse. In
order to have power over, there
must be right and wrong; to
disallow diversity, options must
be narrowed, clear lines are
marked between action and
result, cycles are ignored. In
order for “power over” to have
meaning, approval must be
externalized. Self-focus and self
celebration is exchanged for
external acceptance; trust in
self is discouraged and replaced
by a selfless focus on what
whoever in power deems
“right.” Religion went this route
— the colorful, varied, personalized,
self-celebratory goddesses
were replaced by the ONE GOD;
the women were supposed to be

placated by the token mother of
god (which ignored all but the
fertility powers of women,
definitely on purpose and an
early sign of the misogyny that
would further define women’s
place).

Buried with those figurines
was a self-loving, self-celebrating
(I would use “worship,” but my
Catholic upbringing has invested
that word with far too much
negativity) women’s spiritual
culture. There are many ways to
uncover it, literally and figura-
tively. One essential way is to
start digging through the patriar-
chal muck in our own minds and
lives, to put a lot of energy into
re-centering as strong individual
women, to develop and cherish a
sense of self-trust and self-praise,
to see ourselves and each other,
once again, as goddesses.

BOSTON COLLEGE VS. MARY DALY

Gay Community News, a
Boston newspaper, ran a cover
story on Mary Daly, author of
The Church and the Second Sex,
Beyond God the Father, and
Gyn/Ecology: The Metaethics of
Radical Feminism. Boston
College, where Daly is an asso-
ciate professor, has placed moni-
tors in all her classes and threat-
ened to fire her. Jilt Clark,
author of the article, suggests
that the B.C. administration has
been harassing Daly since her
first book was published because
of her pro-woman, pro-choice
stands and her questioning of
Church doctrine.

We must protect ourselves and
our community from the vicious
attacks by the Enemy. We are
becoming more threatening to
this capitalist, patriarchal system
every day. We must band
together and stand in
DEFIANCE of the authoritarian
powers-that-be.

If the FBI comes knocking at
your door, don't let them in.
Don’t answer their questions
either. I’ve heard rumors of their
activities here in Vermont.

Why not prioritize basic needs of the poor?
Why not quality childcare whatever the cost?

Along with dealing with
liberal survival issues like this
one, there needs to be a lot of
thought and analysis done with
and about children — their
rights, adult power issues, and
how they “fit into society.” But
for right now the focus is the
survival of childcare. By the time
this is printed, the decision
about funding may already have
been made. Whatever the out-
come, the future of quality
childcare is not assured, and it
will surely be an ongoing
struggle.
