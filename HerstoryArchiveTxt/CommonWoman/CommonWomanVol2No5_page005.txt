Dear Commonwoman:

Enclosed is the article,  
“Some Thoughts on Being a  
Medical Student.” Back in  
March, Linda Wittenberg and  
Debi Ennis suggested that I  
write something for the paper.  
I thought it would be easy.  
I thought I could whip it off my  
typewriter in two hours. As I  
started writing, I realized that  
my thoughts weren't organized.  
There was so much to write  
about. Getting it all together in  
my head turned out to be a  
struggle, but a good and reward-  
ing struggle. I am only sorry that  
I took so long in writing it that I  
will no longer be living in  
Burlington when it is printed  
in Commonwoman. I would still  
appreciate the chance to respond  
to any criticism and feedback on  
the article. I consider that one of  
the most important parts of  
writing and communication.

As I start my next phase —  
that of surgical intern, I will  
deeply miss many of the Womyn  
I knew in Burlington. My  
subscription to Commonwoman  
will help me to still feel  
connected to the Burlington web  
while I seek out new spinster/sis-  
ters in Chicagoland. My June  
issue reached me on Friday. It’s  
a great issue, just keeps on  
getting better and better. The  
calendar makes me homesick  
though.

Of course, it goes without  
saying that any Burlington sis-  
ters passing through this way  
will have a place to stay.

Keep on Spinning Sisters!

Just as the Black in our  
society must be able to function  
biculturally, so must womyn  
who enter the male-dominated  
professions be able to function.  
I have learned, in the past four  
years, to speak the language of  
the white coat. The language in  
which lab values and diseased  
organs are talked about rather  
than people. Yet, having been  
raised as a female in this culture,  
I am well versed in the sensibili-  
ties of womanhood. I hear the  
unspoken emotions of patients  
in short hospital gowns. I am not  
afraid of tears or grief or bed-  
pans. It costs me little to  
squeeze a hand or hug a frighten-  
ed person. It’s clear to me as a  
spinning Hag (thank you Mary  
Daly), that the language we use  
does not do justice to our female  
selves. It is a language that has  
been modeled by the patriarchy  
to express and/or lie about their  
selves.

LIFE AFTER THE REVOLUTION

I HAVE GOOD NEWS FOR YOU, SIR

1979

My experience as a medical  
student has been and continues  
to be a struggle between my  
woman-identified consciousness  
and the pull of the patriarchy.  
Having gotten into and finished  
four years, I obviously learned  
and used the male-oriented lan-  
guage and behaviors well enough  
to be an acceptable appearing  
piece of clay for institutional  
modeling. But it has taken  
precious gynergy to keep my  
politics intact. During hard  
times, I've considered the alter-  
natives; drop out of the system  
entirely, work only with womyn  
on the building of our own  
culture, or stay in and sell  
out, toe the line. Either seems  
too extreme to me.

I and other radical womyn  
have felt out of place both in the  
womyn’s community as sellouts  
to the institution, and within the  
institution as radicals — on the  
periphery of their reality. I’ve

often felt that I needed to  
apologize or hide from other  
womyn that I’m a doctor in  
training, since that might make  
me unacceptable. When I hear  
other womyn castigating the  
medical system, I take it person-  
ally. I feel like the monster  
they are talking about. Or, I feel  
that my radical presence in the  
untrustworthy institution — is  
ignored even by other radical  
womyn. It’s a schizophrenic  
kind of feeling which I try to  
correct by constantly question-  
ing the cultural roots of the  
“science” I’m learning and re-  
evaluating my feminist goals of  
change of the practice of medi-  
cine.

I don’t believe that the  
revolution to overthrow the  
patriarchy will happen in my  
lifetime. I do believe, however,  
that I can do something to  
weaken its institutions. I have  
ideas, and a womyn’s culture  
within that I can transmit to  
people whose lives might other-  

wise remain untouched by  
feminist thinking.

I entered medical school full  
of rage and gynergy gained  
through my contact with the  
women of My Sister’s Place, Inc.  
I wondered where the rest of the  
feminists were. None of the  
womyn in my class seemed  
angry or willing to confront  
sexist language. The fact that  
I found only three politically  
aware, woman-identified medical  
students out of approximately  
75 womyn led me to several  
questions. Was I being a feminist  
imperialist, expecting my stage  
of political awareness to be the  
most correct? Is there a place at  
all for feminism in medical  
schools? Do most clear thinking  
radical womyn shun the institu-  
tion of medicine? What keeps  
womyn from bonding with one  
another in medical schools? Is  
our presence there attendant on  
our being good little robots who
