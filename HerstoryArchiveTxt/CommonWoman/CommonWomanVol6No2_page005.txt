The Mayor's Task Force on
Women is a new, active group of
women in our community. Dur-
ing the past few months you
may have heard about the
Women’s Health Day or the Well
Child Clinic, both held at the
Community Health Center on
North Avenue. These events
were organized by the health
subdivision of the Task Force.

You may have gone to one
of the movies or workshops held
during the week-long event, The
Balancing Act: Women and
Their Work, organized by the
economics subdivision of the
Task Force. (One ongoing result
of that week is a support group
for working women. If you are
interested, contact Shen Kaplan
at the YWCA.) The third division, on
safety, is in the process of
organizing a Whistle Stop Cam-
paign. Hopefully, in May, free
whistles will be distributed to all
the women and the elderly in
Burlington. These whistles are
loud, thunderously noisy, and
should be a practical and vocal
beginning to women being able
to feel safer when they walk
down the street — a subject that
provokes every woman's con-

cern. Campaigns have been effective in reducing vio-
lence against women in other
cities when at least 20% of the
women have been armed with
whistles.

The Mayor's Task Force is
made up of women volunteers —
it is not an appointed group.
Last May a group of women,
with different backgrounds and
different interests, met and
decided that it would be a good
idea to have a Women’s Council.
They approached Bernie Sanders
with the idea. He said yes.

There is no funding for the
group. Everything is done by
fund-raising and soliciting volun-
teers. This is hard work and the
accomplishments so far are im-
pressive. This is an ACTIVE
group. We live in a society where
it is many women’s dream to
overthrow the patriarchy, or to
create a life that is as unaffected
by the patriarchal hierarchy as it
is possible to do. In the mean-
time... it is necessary that we

take care of ourselves. We
have to, and have been, provid-
ing for ourselves the things that
we need: crisis centers, child
care, health care, support
groups, cultural events... The
Task Force has joined other
groups in our city in providing
necessary services for women. 
— Some of the issues that the Task
Force wants to address in the
future are: health education,
health care for the elderly, child
care, affirmative action for city
workers, women's paid and
unpaid labor.

Unpaid labor brings up the
disturbing question: how can we
further our movement and still
pay our rent??? Representatives
from the Task Force stress that
they need volunteers. All women
are invited. The only qualifica-
tion is involvement in the
Burlington community. (If you
work in the community and live
outside of it, you are welcome.)
Meetings are held every other
Thursday at 7 p.m. at City Hall.
The next meeting is March
25th.

Right now the most pressing
project is the Whistle Stop
Campaign and womanpower is
needed for accomplishing this in
the community. The Task Force is taking
action. It is less than a year old
and already it has set goals and
reached them. Once again, we
see the determination and effec-
tiveness of women working
together. We know the strengths
of supporting each other, educa-
ting each other, caring for each
other. Whether it’s ideas, time,
expertise, professional know-
ledge — the Task Force would
like the help of all the women in
the community.

Tremblay and Joy Livingston for
donating their time so I could

Incidents of Rape/Sexual
Assault in Vermont

Definition and collection
methods used by state and town
police departments differ, so
data are not comparable. How-
ever, each shows an increase in
the number of rapes/sexual
assaults reported and inves-
tigated 1979-81. Town police
data include attempted rape.

“Any Republican Women
Should Join the Feminist Move-
ment” was the theme for the
Vermont Chapter Women’s Poli-
tical Caucus’ special meeting
held February 23 at the Lobster
Pot in Montpelier. There were
approximately 65 persons pre-
sent.

Its purpose being to win
equal representation for women
in government, the National
Women’s Caucus sees itself as a
grassroots organization, and
thousands of its members work
in 50 states and over 200 cau-
cuses across the country.

The evening began with
Vermont Chapter President
Daphne Gratiot introducing the
approximately eight legislators
present, the majority of whom
were men. It struck me as
peculiar that she failed to
introduce leaders in women’s
organizations and other move-
ments. For example,

Sarka, Director of Vt. Commis-
sion on the Status of Women;
Linda Percy, State Coordinator,
N.O.W.; Carla Thomas, long-time
leader in the AFL-CIO and who
was officially invited by former
President Carter to Washington
as part of a consultant group;
Diane Manghan of Every
Woman's Place, Burlington; and
Pam Schwingle of Middlebury
N.O.W. were all present.

A film was shared, entitled
We Are the Majority, a docu-
mentary portraying heroines in
the women’s movement, going
back to Susan B. Anthony. The
film did not recognize any
women leaders, was graphically
attractive, and featured back-
ground music by Margie Adams
and Sweet Honey in the Rock.

Kathy Wilson, President of
National and guest speaker, was
enthusiastic in her delivery.
After lauding Vermont's aesthe-
tics, she said, “There are things
I could never do before I began
working with the Caucus: like
getting ready in 7 minutes and
smiling when asked ‘what's it
like being a Republican and a
feminist at the same time?’

The Caucus is uniquely
bipartisan; leadership in the
organization is switched (in
terms of party) every 2 years.
Historically the Caucus has had a
predominantly Democratic
membership. Current Republi-
can membership is 35% accord-
ing to Ms. Wilson, and she
stressed the importance of
women working for equal rights
in both parties and staying with
the Republican Party and in-
creasing the number of women
delegates in that party. Accord-

ing to raised hands of the women
attendees.

The fact that only chicken
was served is significant, given
the theme of the event. The lack
of an option for vegetarians is
antithetical to feminist princi-
ples. That consciousness and
sensitivity to creating “safe
spaces” for all women is very
high, especially in the Vermont
feminist community. For exam-
ple, their events are mostly
wheelchair accessible, provide
childcare, sliding scale registra-
tion, are signed for hearing-
impaired and so forth. This is
one faux pas which stood out
quite vividly.

It is ironic that chicken of
all things was served since men
have used this fowl in the
vernacular when referring to
women. To them young women
are “chicks,” older women are
“old biddies,” and the Vt. WPC
saw fit to literally “shove it
down women’s throats.”
