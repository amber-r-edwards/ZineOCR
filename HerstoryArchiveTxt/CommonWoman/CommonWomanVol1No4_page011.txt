COMMONWOMAN DEC. 1978

NOW:

By Barnee Escott

The 1978 National
Conference of the National
Organization for Women (NOW)
was an intense blend of
excitement, frustration, joy,
anger and accomplishment for
the people who attended. Held
in Washington, D.C. on October
6-9, this first National Issues
Conference was convened by
NOW members solely to decide
on policy and priorities for the
organization, and was attended
by over 400 voting delegates
from NOW chapters from all
over the United States, and by
several thousand feminists and
NOW members who came to
participate in the workshops and
speak in the Plenary sessions.

Vermont was represented by

Valerie Eckart, President of
Central Vermont NOW in
Montpelier, Carol Davis,

Vice-President of Champlain
Valley NOW in Burlington, and
Barnee Escott,
Coordinator. Mary Ann
Brennan, Champlain Valley
NOW Treasurer and State
Secretary/Treasurer, and  Paij
Bailey, State Legislative
Coordinator, also attended.

The Conference began on an
incredible wave of excitement
with the Senate’s passage of the
ERA extension legislation, giving

feminists 3 more years to
achieve ratification of the Equal
Rights Amendment. This

legislation, conceived of, fought
for and lobbied for by NOW
activists, was passed on the first
night of the Conference, and
that was a time for celebration!
An “ERA Extension Vote”
Party lasted until the early hours
of the morning. Saturday
morning's Plenary session
opened with welcoming speeches
from Hilda Mason and Marion
Barry, members of the D.C. City
Council, Elizabeth Duncan
Koontz, chair of the National
Commission on Working Women
and Assistant Superintendent of
Schools for North Carolina, and
Sen. Edward Kennedy
(D—Mass), whose remarks were
interesting in omission — he did
not address abortion rights, or
his position on the right of every
woman to choose whether or
not to be pregnant. Other
speakers throughout the
Conference were Elisa Sanchez,
President of the Mexican-American
Women’s National
Organization (MANA); Veronica
Murdock, President of the
National Congress of American
Indians; Anne Turpeau, Chair of
the D.C. Commission on the

Status of Women; and Don
Edwards, U.S. House of
Representatives, San Jose, Cal.,
whose efforts were instrumental
in bringing the ERA extension
vote to a successful climax on
October 6.

It became clear very early in
the first Plenary session that
both the Bylaws Amendments
and Resolutions were very
controversial; an attempt was
made, successfully, to invest
more power in the NOW
National Board (the President,
Vice-Presidents, Secretary,
Treasurer, and regional
representatives elected by the
NOW membership at
Conferences to coordinate
efforts to carry out NOW policy
voted on at National
Conferences), and
unsuccessfully, to deny NOW
participation to members of the
Socialist Workers Party (SWP).
This last move was caused by
concern (nearing hysteria) that
the SWP was trying to co-opt
NOW, especially in the west.
Stories of NOW meetings being
disrupted by SWP members,
NOW chapters being infiltrated,
etc., abounded. Vermont NOW,
never having seen any problems
of this kind, and being
vehemently opposed to
discrimination of any sort in
NOW, including that of political
affiliation, helped to defeat this
amendment.

On a more positive note, the
Conference endorsed a number
of comprehensive Resolutions,

making them National NOW
policy and goals for the next
two years. Among these
Resolutions were: extending
National NOW’s State of
Emergency on the ERA;
initiating a broad-based

campaign to protect abortion
rights; opposing unanimously
the Briggs Initiative in California
and Initiative 13 in Seattle, both
specific pieces of anti-gay
legislation; endorsing barrier-free
facilities, assistance for the blind
and interpreters for the deaf at
all National and State NOW
meetings; declaring the present
nursing home situation as a
social crime against all women
(75% of all patients in nursing
homes are women) and
mandating actions to be taken;
passing a detailed Resolution
calling for NOW to work more
closely with Labor, including
supporting the WINN-DIXIE
boycott, continuing to support
the J.P. STEVENS boycott, and
actively participating in
November 13 Karen Silkwood

Memorial Day Actions;
supporting the Constitutional
Amendment giving
Congressional voting
representation to D.C.;
establishing a Rural Women’s

Committee; and finally, after a
very lengthy debate and a close
vote, opposing the proposed
HEW guidelines for sterilization,
which mandate a 30-day waiting
period between the time a
woman requests to be sterilized
and the operation.

Cinemawomen

Cinemawomen gathered last
week to plan their schedule for
the winter months ahead. One
decision that came out of the
general discussion was a
commitment to show films on
random evenings through the
winter, instead of a weekly
series. The first evening is
planned for Dec. 11 at Cook
B106, UVM, at 7:30 when the
highly acclaimed hour-long film
on Georgia O'Keeffe will be
screened. Accompanying it will
be Musereel No. 1: Tapestry of
Womanspirit, a documentation
of the first women’s spirituality
conference in Boston, 1976.

The day-long women’s film
festival that kicked off the Take
the Bull by the Horns Film
Series last year was remembered
nostalgically. Energetic
Cinemawomen wanted to

sponsor a similar event this
winter, running perhaps a whole
weekend dedicated to women
and the media, with films,
workshops, etc. Strong support
came for an involvement with
political education: for example,
making TV ads to inform the
public on the difference between
Right-to-Life and
Right-To-Choose (an issue that
will be surfacing again in the
State House this winter with

renewed debate over the
Mandigo Bill.

In a desire to reach out to a
larger audience, the

Cinemawomen want to involve
women from different groups in
town to help plan the event. If
you have suggestions call
862-4929, or come to the next
meeting at Green Valley Film
and Art Center, 90 Main St.
(back door).

BLACK DAWN

By Meri Furnari

Black Dawn formed in the
minds of two Vermont
filmmakers four years ago. And
now after two years of
production, including eight
months in Haiti and a New York
preview, it will be shown here.

Riddle: “Why is this film
called Black Dawn?” Response:
“Because you never see it!”
Such a joke grew out of the
pressure of the self-imposed
deadline to show this animated
version of the Haitian
Revolution at the Brooklyn
Museum on October 28. The
museum invited the film artists
Robin Lloyd and Doreen Kraft
(of Burlington's Orchid Films)
to show their work on that date
as part of a six-week Exhibition
of Haitian Art that began there
in October.

Black Dawn is a retelling of
the Haitian Revolution through
mythology and the lives of a
woman and man taken into
slavery and shipped there in the
late 1700s. The first slave
rebellion was sparked in part by
a voodoo ceremony at Bois
Caimon in 1791. The Haitians
won their independence in 1804
through a unique synthesis of
courage, desperation and
religious devotion. Haiti, now a
dictatorship and one of the
world’s economically poorest
nations, was among the first
countries to echo French and
American calls for freedom.

In the film, cut-out and card
animation along with
‘rotoscoping’ and cell animation
techniques are used to portray
the richness, magic and power of

ancient voodoo in Haitian life;
and the prominent role these
religious beliefs played in the
slaves’ revolts. (More can be
learned about animation and

Haiti by attending the
Burlington screening on
December 17.)

Doreen and Robin

collaborated with Haiti’s artists,
writers and folklorists as well as
many others to create Black
Dawn. The film project has been
supported by grants from the
Vermont Council on the Arts
and the Maverick Foundation.
The large task of distributing
the completed film lies ahead. It
is the hope of Orchid Films that
Black Dawn be an educational
resource on Haitian art and
history to reach people through
museum, library and school film
collections and educational

television. Further funding for
distribution is sought.

Black Dawn is an innovative
combination of Haitian primitive
art styles and these film artists’
ideas. The result is a fantastic
20-minute cinematic experience.

All are invited to see Black
Dawn at its Burlington premiere
on Sunday, December 17 at
UVM’s Williams Hall (2nd floor).
There will be a reception from
7—9 in the Colburn Gallery at
the same location; the screening
will be at 8:00 p.m. An exhibit
of the paintings done by twelve
Haitian artists along with some
of the work done by
Burlingtonians will be on
display. The filmmakers: Robin,
Doreen and yours truly, Meri,
will also be around to enrich
your movie outing. See you
there!
