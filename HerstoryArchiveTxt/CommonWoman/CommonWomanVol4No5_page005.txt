To Vote

By Pamela Kraynak*

Every election year around
this time I encounter many
women who either have never
voted or who have decided not
to vote. The reasons are varied.
They range from apathy, lack of
knowledge, or frustration to
principled decisions not to be
involved in electoral politics. I
think that all women, including
radical feminists, should vote.

My ideas about voting have
nothing to do with what I was
told in eighth grade social
studies. I’m not talking about
making a so-called “representa-
tive” democracy work or our
duty to exercise a valued right
given to us in the U.S. Constitu-
tion. My reasons for voting are
more pragmatic.

It bothers me that I often
feel there aren't any candidates
to choose among. It bothers me
that if women ran for office who
held many of my beliefs, they
probably would not win. It
bothers me that even if these
women did win, their chance of
being effective becomes slight
given the institution of Congress
and the legislatures and the
powerful lobbying groups that
exercise so much control. With
these feelings it’s easy to be-
come frustrated and think it
doesn’t matter or that I don't
want to be a party to perpetua-
ting a system dominated by men
and their values.

However, electoral politics
involves choices of degree that
can be very important to

Thoughts on the Electoral
Process

By Marcia Marshall

These days, November 2
looms large in my consciousness.
Some days it hangs there like a
mythical golden ring one might
reach for as the carousel passes.
Other days it is a black hole, an
inevitable deadline. And while I
campaign, I realize that it all
comes down to how many
people will pull the lever next to
my name (or check the box) in
13 of the towns around Chitten-
den County on November 2. But
what is quite amazing about this
entire, distinctly American pro-
cess is that there are so many
influences on the voter that
work against the candidate that
you wonder why you try.

I think the answer to “why
vote?” is quite simple: There are
at least 36 people who are vying
for permission to participate on
your behalf in the process of
governing your life, in over a
dozen different positions. These
people are running in many
different races and parties: they
are Democrats, Republicans,
Citizens’ Party, Liberty Union,
Libertarian... and of course
Independents (people who, at
least for the purpose of the
election, purport to have no
party affiliation). The strength
of the vote a candidate receives
reflects the number of people
who wish to bestow confidence
in them. A candidate can still get

women. We are all influenced
greatly by the decisions made
in these forums whether we like
it or not. Decisions are made
concerning how our taxes will be
spent, the quality of the air we
breathe, whether women will get
a $1.50 or $2.00 subsidy for
daycare, whether we will be able
to control our own bodies, and
whether AFDC needed to raise
our children will become more
oppressive by the thirty and a
third rule.

Candidates do differ on
these issues. These decisions are
vital to women, particularly
those who are unable to create
alternative communities. We
have a responsibility to ourselves
and these women that the best
possible mixture of people will
make these decisions.

We know that men will not
represent our interests — just
look at the fact that we couldn't
even think of voting a mere sixty
years ago. Women candidates,
not the Schlafly types, who
choose to use their skills to run
for office need our support. The
Madeline Kunins and the Robin
Lloyds will never win if we as
women don’t vote for them.

Candidates that will decide
the “right way” on issues that
concern us often do not have
access to the great money
machines and special interest
groups that too often skew the
outcome of an election. Our

vote is the only means in an
election to counteract these
influences.

Vote...Some Thoughts

elected even though a majority
of registered voters do not give
their approval. So long as a
candidate receives a majority
vote by the people who chose to
participate, that candidate will
get elected. You may choose not
to participate in the electoral
process by not voting, but your
opinion will not be heard, and
not recorded in the form of a
vote for the opposition.

You can give the opposition
permanent legitimacy by voting
for them. Win or lose, almost
counts! Sometimes it may seem
appropriate for you not to vote,
especially when you see the
choice to be one between the
worse of two evils. I believe that
even in these cases, it is impor-
tant to empower yourself with
that decision, not to leave it to
chance. This year in Vermont,
there are many options for the
voter. That suggests that it is
worthwhile to vote.

Emma Goldman, the noted
anarchist, has said, “In America,
voting is the opiate of the
people.” I think that Americans
have a history of being politi-
cally passive and apathetic, but
today we are suffering from the
consequences of non-participa-
tion. The opposition needs to be
empowered by your vote. The
dictionary defines vote (n.) as a
formal expression of one’s opi-
nion or choice on a matter under
discussion. Although much has
been made of the power of the
voter, that may not have been

or

Right-wingers and commen-
tators that influence public
thinking don’t care or talk about
it as a statement if you don’t
vote — you're just classified as
apathetic. Or else, some are even
glad you don't vote. The simple
fact that many people don’t vote
(only about 30% in a Presidential
election) makes your own
vote far more influential than
just one of many. This is espec-
ially true in a small state like
Vermont. County races for state
senators and representatives are
literally won by a few votes.
Ex-Senator Melvin Mandigo
from Orleans County justified
his opposition to Medicaid abor-
tions for victims of rape and
incest by saying in a hearing that
as an artificial inseminator, when
he “forces” his intentions on a
bovine female, she will not
become pregnant unless she
“wants to.” He won by approxi-
mately twenty votes and he’s
running again.

Each of our votes is also
becoming more influential
because of the pollster’s game.
Did you know that they have
now decided it's “worthwhile”
to track a “women’s” vote? We
vote differently than men. We
are less supportive of Reagan, his
inhumane policies, and the mili-
tary than men. Being counted in
a poll is illusory as far as equal-
ity goes, but it’s important
because politicians are gradually
being forced to take us into
account. Governor

justified. I think this year’s local
election is different. This year
the voters really do have a
choice in many races. The
opposition left is stronger than
ever. Depending on the race,
your vote can have different
weights. Usually you choose
between two candidates. This
year you will choose between
five candidates in some races.
Your opposition could be
powerful. In an ‘at large’ race,
such as mine, voters get to select
several candidates.

In the race for Chittenden
County's Senate seats, I am one
of 13 candidates vying for six
positions. Here, the voter is
asked to select six candidates.
Your six votes count equally;
unless you feel you don’t wish
to choose six. You may vote for
as few as one. Political jargon
calls voting for just one person
in a race like this ‘Bullet Voting.’
When you bullet vote in this
race, your vote has the weight of
six, because you're not adding to
the totals of other candidates.

So, for a candidate like me,
your vote is of strategic impor-
tance. If 300 people bullet vote
for me, it carries the weight of
1800 votes. This creates a dual
problem: not only do I need to
motivate you to vote at all, I
need to communicate to you
that your vote can be an effec-
tive tool for change.

Many things influence whe-
ther or not you vote. You may
be apathetic, believing that your

the daycare subsidy three weeks

losing battle to convince him
before now and the Ethan Allen
Daycare Center has been shut

Finally, Reagan and his New
Federalism are changing where
these decisions are being made.
State legislatures will have a
great deal more power over our
lives. We have much reason to
fear for our sisters in Mississippi
and Louisiana. However, the
shift presents an amazing oppor-
tunity for us to greatly influence
what goes on in this small state.

Although I respect women
that have spent time and given
thought to decide against voting,
I’m asking you to reconsider —
to think about the effect of that
inaction. I think it can be really
harmful to ourselves and other
women. For women who've just
never gotten around to voting, I
hope maybe a few of these
reasons have convinced you, or
triggered thoughts of your own,
to register before Nov. 2.

vote won't really make a differ-
ence (although I hope I will
convince you otherwise). In
addition, something as inconse-
quential as the weather on
November 2 will influence voter
turn-out. So why bother?
Because I think I can win, if I
convince you to vote strategi-
cally. One way to prove to
yourself, and others, that your
vote does count is to bullet vote
for me in this election.

You may ask, why should I
vote for Marcia Marshall, and
not for other women on the
ballot, or some of the men. This
is a harder question. First, I
think those of you who know
my positions on the issues of
importance to the “women’s
community” know I am in full
support of the things you
want. Some of the positions I
support are: increased monies
for day care including tax
incentives for business; nuclear
freeze and massive reductions in
military spending; reproductive
rights; state and federal ERA;
lesbian rights; expansion of
stronger environmental and con-
servation legislation; strong legis-
lative response to federal cut-
backs for programs affecting low
income women, children and
elderly.

Some of the positions I
oppose: crisis relocation; nuclear
waste shipments through Ver-
mont; Chittenden County juve-
nile jail.

If Voting Could Change the
System, It Would Be Illegal
don't vote because we want
revolution not reform
don't vote because you
legitimate (make real, create) the
system, the state, patriarchy,

hierarchy, the Unmovable Struc-
ture.

don't vote because it won't
close the banks or prisons, stop
men from raping and battering,
change the world or make us free
— despite all arguments to the
contrary

don't vote and think you
have taken action. voting builds
passivity.

don't vote and lull younger
feminists into thinking that
earlier gains were achieved via
the ballot box.

“Freedom is the will to be
responsible for one’s self.” don’t
vote and give responsibility
(“representation”) to someone
else

Another quote and I'll stop!
— “Desire may take two courses.
It may affirm itself or it may fix
upon power and established
order as its object.”

I am a progressive. I am
unsatisfied with the status quo
and wish to see many reforms in
our society. As a member of the
Citizens’ Party, I’m independent
of the reigning political

machines. I will be more respon-
sive to your wishes than any
party's leadership.

Furthermore, if elected I
pledge to be open and responsive
to your needs. If elected I would
urge and welcome your con-
tinued input to keep me abreast
of those grassroots community
concerns which affect all our
lives now and in the future.

Ronald Reagan wants to
turn much power back to the
states. Whether he succeeds or
not, the state legislatures will be
taking more and more active
part in influencing the
way of life here in Vermont. I want
to be a part of that process, not
just lobbying from the sidelines.
It’s time for the feminist com-
munity to have more voices in
the Vermont Senate. Give me
the chance to voice your opinion
where the tough decisions are
being made. Thanks for your
support. Vote for me, Marcia
Marshall, on November 2.
