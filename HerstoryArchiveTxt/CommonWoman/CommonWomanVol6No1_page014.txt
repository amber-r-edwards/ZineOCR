At the TR Clinic on the
30th, we'll get more into “how-
to’s” or you can write us for
literature. We'll have the “People
Pay for Peace” handbook avail-
able too.

Paij:

And the telephone

sts
x
~

Lori: Yes. That is a direct
military tax, started to raise
money for Vietnam. The tele-
phone company requires a letter
from you every month stating
you do not wish to pay the
federal war tax, so that they can
report it to the IRS. The tele-
phone company is not responsi-
ble for prosecution. Did you
know that although that tax was
supposed to end in 1982 it has
been extended to 1984?

Paij: Why?

Lori: I believe it’s because
they know they can get away
with it.

Paij: What are the risks
involved in tax resistance?

Lori: It is important to
know that TR is against the law,
TR is illegal. Joyce McDonald
says that “when laws are unjust,
it is the responsibility of just
persons to disobey them.” It is a
question of morality versus
legality. You're going to be
either immoral or illegal. I would
much rather be a conscientious
truthful person than a person
who gives money to help kill
people.

Paij: What can the IRS do
to you?

Lori: The IRS is a collection
agency for the federal govern-
ment. They are a huge bureau-
cracy. Most often the local IRS
is the group that will start to
prosecute... The Conscience
Military Tax Campaign recommends
that you send your income tax
(or statement of refusal) to the
national office so that the
national office gets an idea how
we're thinking.

One of the things the IRS
does is send out a “summons”
signed by the head of the local
IRS stating, “you are required to
appear at the IRS Office. You
are required to pay...” These
“summons” are threats, they are
not legal. They do this to get
people scared. The local IRS has
been known to send out a
second notice — even when the
first was never sent.

However, if you get a
Federal Tax Court Summons,
this is the real thing.

The IRS can attach your
bank account, garnish your
wages, place a lien against your
car, your house. This year in
Colorado, they sold an $80,000
house for $510. This person was...
not a TR; but I mention this to
demonstrate the lengths they
sometimes go to get some
money. Many times they spend
more money trying to collect
than they get in their collection
attempts. Many people have
refused to pay and have had
their bank accounts attached. If
you feel strongly that you don’t
want your money to go to war,
it may mean changing your
lifestyle — like keeping your
money out of banks, or becom-
ing an independent contractor,
self-employed, or reducing your
income so that you make less
than $3,300 a year.

Paij: How many people have
been prosecuted?

Lori: There have been 6
pacifists prosecuted in the last
30 years. No one has received
more than 2 years. Most often,
people have served time for
contempt of court — refusing to
acknowledge the judge's emi-
nence.

Paij: Are there psycholo-
gical ramifications resulting from
TR?

Lori: Yes, paranoia and
isolation creep in sometimes.
But I know that I’d rather be
paranoid than guilty for the
bombing of Vietnam, for the
41,000 killed in El Salvador,
Chile, Argentina, or for the
Bikini people who still cannot go
home after 30 years because the
radiation is still so intense on the
Bikini stand of mass destruc-
tion... Responsibility for those
murders is much worse than the
personal sacrifice. Yes, it’s scary,
but genocide is irreparable.

I get sick at the gall of those
people who think they can play
with people’s lives. I get physi-
cally sick. I don’t read TR
literature during my meals any-
more. It takes seven minutes for
a bomb to get to Russia. This
makes me nauseous. It trans-
cends race, class, sex, age.
Nuclear holocaust spares no
human, no animal; no matter
what barriers you put up they
won't save you.

Paij: Do you get challenged
with the “Communist Take-
Over” rhetoric?

Lori: Yes. The reality is that
the United States is far more
imperialistic and expansionistic
than the USSR. The United
States has influence in 70% of
the world’s important countries,
while the USSR's influence is—
mostly confined to the USSR
and border states. The USSR has
expanded their efforts to help
local people’s revolutions in
Angola for example. But even
with the Soviets having influence
in 20% of the world’s important
countries, the Soviet Bloc com-
mands only 4-6% of the Interna-
tional Gross National Product.
They are not a major economic
threat. The USSR is mostly
worried about their border
states. They have more reason to
be scared than the United States.
They experienced war first-hand,
when six million Jews died in
Germany along with homo-
sexuals, intelligentsia, Gypsies,
scientists. In Russia they have
experienced the genocide of
20,000,000 people within the
last generation during World War
II. They know what war and
death is like.

Russia is more self-sufficient
in terms of natural resources: it
produces 50% of the world’s oil,
they don’t have to go into Saudi
Arabia or Egypt or the Middle
East to gain influence because
they are resource self-sufficient.

In terms of the arms race,
75% of the time the Russians
have been behind and have had
to catch up. It’s only 25% of the
time that the Russians have been
ahead. The Soviet Union has
never broken an arms treaty
with the U.S. They have even
made arms reduction initiatives.
They really don’t have the
money to spend on war. The
Soviet Union is poorer, they
have less access to consumer
resources than the United States.

“Gross

treaty with the USSR, we’re told
“you can't trust the Russians.”

We don't need to “trust” the
Russians; we have technology
that negates that need. We have
extraordinary technology in
detection systems. The govern-
ment does not need to rely on
human trust since it has highly
advanced surveillance systems to
make sure the Soviets and the
U.S. are abiding by their treaty.

Paij: What about the “we-
need-a-strong-defense” argument?

Lori: My friend says a good
defense is a good home, ade-
quate health care, good food. I
am inclined to agree with that
idea of security.

Reagan and others think we
need a strong military to be
secure, but how secure are we
when a limited nuclear war
would involve the death of
15 million people, in an instant;
that is New York City twice
over. They predict with a full
scale nuclear war the U.S. would
lose 150 million people. That is
3 out of 4 of us and those
remaining alive would probably
not want to be because of the
radiation sickness, the decaying
corpses. Military might, especial-
ly nuclear weapons, guarantees
our security as dead people. The
scariest thing though is with the
computerized weapons system
that we have we might all be
wiped out by a failure of a
computer component. This is
not an unfounded fear. We have
come within seven minutes of
sending nuclear missiles off
several times within the last year
due to computer error. Our lives
are in the hands of the Pentagon
and fallible machines. And even
crazier - is that with 30,000
nuclear weapons in our arsenals,
we're building 3-6 new nuclear
weapons each day!! The U.S. is
working on a study to determine
how long it would take for the
National Product to
become the same as it was
before a full scale nuclear war.
Isn't that insane? The U.S. is
concerned with how long it
would take us to regain econo-
mic strength, not with people or
lives. World War II brought
us out of the depression and the
government still believes that
war is good for the economy.
However, this is no longer true.
The U.S. emphasis on military
technology means that our other
technology has fallen behind in
the competition.

A U.S. Department of
Labor study says that for every
billion dollars spent on the
military we create 20,000 jobs
less than if it was spent in any
other sector. For example, edu-
cation, health care, transportation. In the case of education,
you create over twice as many
jobs per billion dollars spent.
This idea of military might as a
national security means high
unemployment, lack of human
services.

Paij: You're strong,
conscious and clear in your
position...

Lori: I’ve been involved in
TR for about 6 years. I’ve
known about TR since I was a
child, about thirteen, fourteen
years old.

Paij: Your excitement, your
anger is real strong...

Lori: Well, I do get intimi-
dated sometimes...

Paij: Why?

Lori: Well, people think I
have all this information.

Actually, the information is out
there and accessible to every-
one... with the anger comes
determination and everything...
so much energy...

Paij: Is there a base to
