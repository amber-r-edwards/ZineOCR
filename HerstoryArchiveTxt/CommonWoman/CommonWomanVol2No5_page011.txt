INDEPENDENT STUDY
LEADING TO THE B.A. DEGREE

Goddard’s Adult Degree
Program, founded in 1963, sup-
ports women and men in their
search for truth, growth, and
change. The ADP offers a four
year course of individually
planned study leading to a fully
accredited B.A. degree. Each
semester consists of a two-week
program on campus in Vermont
and five and one-half months

of non-resident study. This
program is designed for self-
motivated adults of at least 21
years of age. Teacher certifica-
tion is possible upon completion
of the teacher education cur-
riculum. Past successful college
work, CLEP general tests, and
“educational life experience”
may earn advanced standing.

Other challenging B.A. and
M.A. programs.

Approved for payment of
Veteran's benefits.

Open Letter

plans, she finally returned our
calls at 9 p.m. and said that our

interview had been cancelled.
When asked “Why,” she said
that they had heard rumors
about us and preferred to leave
us out. From that evening on
through Wednesday at 4 p.m. we
spent hours trying to find out
specifically why she wanted to
leave us out and trying to have
her hear how that made us feel.

Her reasons for not inclu-
ding us were:

1. That she and her partners
had heard rumors of us being
radical lesbians. She thought this
would make people uncomfor-
table.

2. That there was no room
left on the tape.

By choosing to leave us out
you are invalidating that we
exist, that we as people exist and
that our organization has been
working with battered women in
the community for years. The

Women’s House of Transition is

the only shelter in northern New
England (except for the Brattle-
boro Shelter which has opened

recently). The WHOT has sprung
out of the needs of this com-
munity and was begun and is run

by community volunteers.

We choose to volunteer even
though this means working ano-
ther job to financially support
ourselves. We experience the
battering of all women in this
culture and believe we need to
help and support other women
survive the violence and break
out of our own self-hating and
passive roles. Women need to

given by feminists and shelter
groups who work with battered
women. They recommend public
funding for shelters and hotlines,
with priority in funding to go to
“grass-roots feminist groups and
pre-existing shelters.”

After the tape ended, Dottie
Shami said no action has been
taken by the legislature or by
Governor Eleanor Grasso. Shami
also said the tape had been
criticized because many more
poor and third world battered
women were shown than white
middle-class battered women.
Battering cuts across all class and
race lines. :

The tape can be purchased
for $200 (or less — there’s a
sliding scale), or rented for $40
from Eggplant Media Produc-
tions, 2148 Main St., Glaston-
bury, Conn. 06033 (phone
203-659-0197 early mornings).

Following is a list of con-
tacts and houses for battered
women in Vermont. They all
need help, whatever you can give
in time and energy or money.

recognize that we have choices
and can be independent people.

We all need to recognize
that the reality of domestic
violence is not just in bruises or
scars or isolated “victims,” but a
whole cycle of self-hate and
powerlessness that women grow
and live in. These myths keep us

isolated and keep us from
helping ourselves and other
women.

By deciding not to include
us in the videotape, you con-
tinue to treat women as isolated
victims not allowing them to
hear a perspective that sees
violence as a cultural problem.

By leaving us out because
we don’t conform to your image
of a professional social service
agency, you feed into people’s
fears and rumors, failing to
challenge them with factual
resources and information.

What is it you are trying to
show? You claim your focus is
on our culture’s condoning of
violence.

When we told Marcia we felt
ripped off she responded in
several ways:

1. Due to time pressure we
are forced to make decisions we
don’t necessarily agree with, or
feel good about.

—Marcia, you and your
partners need to take responsi-
bility for your decisions.

2. You invited us to a
planning meeting on Monday,
July 16 (which we attended with
this statement).

—How much can we trust
you are going to be open to us?

Action

took the money and kept
harassing him. The bartender
asked us to leave, but we told
him we wouldn’t unless he threw
Mr. S. out too. Mr. S. got up
and backed away to one of the
tables. Just then G really got in
touch with her anger and lit into
him more. He handed her
another $100! She took it,
but she kept on yelling. He made
a quick exit. By this time we had
the attention of everyone in the
place and all the women were
smiling!

What a great way to spend
an evening. Not all actions are so
rewarding (and some are more
so), but each one is an important
addition to our wholeness. As
for the $200, the activists
decided to donate it to a local
organization dealing with vio-
lence against women.

I’d like it if other women
would share their actions, stories
or whatever with us all.

3. Marcia offered to
“squeeze us in” and videotape us
after 4 p.m. on Wednesday, July

11.

—After our calling to con-
firm this, we spoke with Jane
(Marcia’s partner), who con-
firmed our fear that there was
no chance of the videotape being
used in the presentation.

4. You say you don’t want
us to feel ripped off. .

—Are you willing to pay us
for our time?

5. You say you want to help
us in ways other than the
videotape.

—Are you willing to help us
get a grant from the Council on
Humanities, to share our per-
spective and work?

6. You say you want to help
communications between us and
other people and groups.

—Then why did you leave us
out of the videotape?

(Editor’s Note: Marcia
Marshall has made a videotape
about battered wives to be used
as a pilot for a series on Channel
22. She has neglected to use
input from the only long-stand-
ing project on battered wives in
Vermont, the Women’s House of
Transition. She has shown her-
self to be unaccountable to
women, although her series will
be all about women and is
happening precisely because
there has been a women’s
movement.

Women who want TV pro-
gramming that is accountable
should call her at 862-3517 and
voice their opinions.)

Minds

these myths are being passed
around and supported by our
culture? I think it has a lot to do
with keeping oppressions intact.
(I'm thinking here specifically
about the oppression of women,
although this applies to all forms
of oppression.) The strong feel-
ing we get that thinking means
worrying about the problems of
the world (and is therefore hard
and frustrating, and should be
avoided) is designed to keep us
from doing exactly that. If we
actually were allowed and
encouraged to think about
what's not going right in our
lives, it’s likely (there being
many good minds among us)
that we'd come up with some
daring and creative solutions.
This has in fact happened many
times in the history of women,
so the forces that want to keep
us from using our minds have
good cause to worry.

Our power to straighten out
the world and to make it the

“way we want it to be lies primar-

ily in our ability to think about
what’s not right, and how to
change it. There are enough
myths already sidetracking us
from this natural ability of ours
(that we can’t think, that it
won't do any good anyhow, that
it’s not appropriate to appear
smarter than men, etc.). Let’s
not give credence to this one,
either. We not only can think,
we can enjoy ourselves with our
minds fully present; and in this
way can affirm our strength,
which is greater than all the
oppressive tools designed to
keep us quiet!
