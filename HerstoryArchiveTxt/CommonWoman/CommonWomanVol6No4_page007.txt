FAMILY PROTECTION ACT

Info from Off Our Backs
Gathered by Nancy Powell

The Family Protection Act
is the brainchild of men who
want a return to the good old
days when there was a mom in
every kitchen, abortion was
found only in back alleys, and
faggots were for burning. This
bill is the work of traditionalists
who do not recognize alternative
lifestyles as being viable, and
who would contain you and me
in their model nuclear family
unit, replete with enforced
Christianity, heterosexuality and
Puritan work ethic.

In keeping with the assault
on abortion rights, the F.P.A.
would eliminate Federal funding
of “family planning” services
which are now available to
unmarried minors without par-
ental notification. According to
a recent study by Planned
Parenthood, 2/3 of abortions
were obtained by women under
24 years of age, 75% of whom
were unmarried. The F.P.A. is thus
a major aspect of the right-wing
move to drive abortion avail-
ability underground.

The F.P.A. restricts the
Federal government from pre-
empting state statutes dealing
with juvenile delinquency and
child abuse. Even the term
“child abuse” is redefined by the
bill, making corporal punish-
ment by the parent legal. The
F.P.A. will also eliminate funds
provided through the Legal
Service Corporation for litiga-
tion involving abortion, divorce,
and homosexual rights. Not only
would it deny legal aid to
homosexuals, it would “deny
federal funds to any public or
private individual or group who
exists for the purpose of advo-
cating, promoting or suggesting
homosexuality as a lifestyle.”
Says Lucia Valeska, of the
National Gay Rights Task Force,
“Lesbians and gay men in
virtually every community in
our nation must live with the
threat of repression and even
violence. The F.P.A. would
legitimize the repression, create
a climate which encourages
the violence, and make a large
segment of the American popu-
lation second class citizens.”
Official disapproval of homo-
sexuality will not reduce the
number of gays in this country,
it will only make being “out”
more difficult. Martin Weinberg
of the Kinsey Institute for Sex
Research says, “This legislation
takes something that is normal
and natural and makes it shame-
ful, and this is the real shame of
the F.P.A.”

Senate Bill 1578, once part
of the F.P.A., seeks to restate
prayer in public schools. Joseph
Conn of Americans United for
Separation of Church and State
says, “The bill would reverse the
(Supreme) court decision (pro-
hibiting government sponsorship
of religious activity) and put
schools back in the business of
telling children when and how to
pray.” Though cloaked in the
language of “voluntary prayer,”
what the bill seeks is vocal group
prayers — with abstainers allow-
ed to go into exile outside the
classroom.

Under the Act, families
could deposit $2,500/year tax-
free in an Education Savings
Account. Parent-run schools
would receive tax exemptions.
The tax incentives to parents
would act to unconstitutionally
aid private schools, the majority
of which are run by churches
and other religious organiza-
tions.

In education, the F.P.A.
contains a title which prohibits the
use of federal funds to “secure
or promote” educational mater-
ials which tend to “denigrate,
diminish or deny the role
differences between the sexes as
it has been historically under-
stood in the United States.” The
bill furthers sexism by giving
local education agencies the
right to limit or prohibit inter-
mingling of the sexes in sports or
other school-related activities.
This section would create in
young women the old view that
women and men are inherently
different and their roles can in
no way be interchanged or
compromised.

The F.P.A. is no friend of
teachers’ unions; it will take
away collective bargaining agree-
ments under the Labor Manage-
ment Relations Act, which
requires membership in a labor
union as a condition of employ-
ment, thus destroying union
security. Another provision will
prohibit the Federal government
from constructing any law to
prohibit the right of any state or
local educational agency to
determine the requisite qualifi-
cations of teachers (including
the right not to require a certifi-
cate). This would surely affect
the quality of teachers in our
schools. Women will be most
affected by these provisions,
since most teachers are women.

Women are supposed to believe
that the work they do is not
worthy of good pay and job
security.

Title II of the F.P.A. will
deny legal assistance under the
Legal Service Corporation Act to
any proceeding relating solely to
the achievement of racial quotas
for the desegregation of any
elementary or secondary school.
This provision will isolate child-
ren from other races, promoting
racism as well as creating in-
equality between school sys-
tems.

The F.P.A. would “preserve
and protect the integrity of
religious institutions,” by plac-
ing their “child care centers,
orphanages, foster homes, social
action training programs, emer-
gency shelters for abused child-
ren” outside of federal regula-
tion. The same organizations
would be exempt from regula-
tions of affirmative action, quo-
tas, guidelines or actions design-
ed to overcome racial imbalance.

Illegal abortion, tax breaks
for the wealthy, union busting, a
continued call for equal rights
for lesbians and gays — the F.P.A.
portends all this and more.

VIOLENCE

GRAND JURY HUNTS

By Bernardine Dohrn

I will not be coerced into
naming names. I will not talk to
this illegal grand jury. For my
whole life I have refused to talk
to the F.B.I. or the police. The
Government is punishing me —
as well as four women who are
already in jail for refusing to talk
to the grand jury — for our
political beliefs and activities.
John Martin and the F.B.I. know
that I have committed no crime;
the largest police task force ever
assembled has no evidence to
charge me.

I am being jailed
not for anything I have done but
for what I will not do: give the
Government information about
my activities or beliefs, friends
and associates.

People may not know that
Jerry Gaines, a dignified Black
woman from Mississippi and
mother of eight, has been jailed
in New York for over three
months for refusing to collaborate. So have Yaasmyn Fula,
mother of a four-year-old from
whom she has never before been
separated; Asha Renee Thorn-
ton, mother of one, and Eve
Rosahn. After being jailed twice
by this grand jury, Fulani
Sinni-Ali, mother of five, chose
not to appear at her last hearing.
Anyone can be subpoenaed and
required to appear behind closed
doors to answer questions with-
out a lawyer present. We can be
held in jail for the entire life of
the grand jury (up to 18 months
in this case), and even then
could be re-subpoenaed. We are
offered the choice of cooperat-
ing with these secret proceedings
or going to jail for our silence.

United States Attorney
John Martin has singled out
women, mainly Black women
and mothers, to imprison in this
medieval fashion. Apparently, he
thinks we are weak. He is using
this grand jury illegally to gather
information on the most vigor-
ous opponents of wars against
the Third World, racist attacks
on the Black community, and
the assault against women and
the poor.

I was a political fugitive for
eleven years. I was on the
F.B.I.'s Ten Most Wanted List
for over four years. When I
turned myself in over a year
ago, I made it clear I would not
talk about those years. I am the
mother of three young children;
I work for decent day care; I
speak on campuses about the
astonishing parallels between the
war the Government is today
waging against the people in El
Salvador and the war against
Vietnam. I am also working to
reopen the case of the New York
Three, three Black militants
imprisoned for over ten years
after being framed for the
killings of two police. Since the
events in Nyack, the F.B.I. has
reinvented the Weather Under-
ground. My picture has appeared
in endless articles and police-
inspired stories.

MORE CAGES

I was not involved in the
Nyack events. However, many of
the defendants are my friends
and I know them to be commit-
ted people. Since the initial four
arrests in Nyack, a widening
circle of people, primarily Black
people involved in political
organizing, have been harassed,
subpoenaed and arrested. I
believe rebellion will continue in
a country where the conditions
of life are intolerable for so
many. My belief that the United
States Government is the great-
est menace to the people of the
world has not changed.

On May 19, 1982, Bernar-
dine Dohrn was jailed for civil
contempt. She is presently at
Metropolitan Correctional Cen-
ter, 150 Park Row, New York,
New York 10007 (No.
04556054).
