SIREN’S SONG

in memoriam

Pointing our faces to the sun that day

we beached on the bleached white

stones of the graves of

Ezra Bennet, Esq., and his four, nameless,
wives.

We felt our roots driving down to

Sarah Sweeney, wife of Abel, drowned

in her bed in birthing.

Blood.

My loving that sun-bleached day

was hot and hurt

was singed on the prisms in your wild snake hair
we shared your passion fruit, later

sweet orange pulp

Otterlike and wet
you frisked and rolled
basking

you frisk

Otterlike and wet

you frisked and rolled

basking belly up in my regard.

Picking the bits of gravel and grass from your breasts
you drew for me word pictures

of your Greek minstrel lover...

...the classic form of her smile

and her strong, sinister songs

Warrior Women on the water’s edge
strange poets in a graveyard.

“At the beginning of the summer of 1896 a young

trooper in the Royal Horse Guards named Wool-

ridge was taken to Reading Gaol from Windsor. He

had ‘cut his wife’s throat in a most determined
manner, she having... greatly annoyed him.’”

(Oscar Wilde, by Philippe Julian

The Viking Press, N.Y. 1969, p.349)

“One day (Pan) was chasing the nymph Syrinx and
had nearly caught her when she cried aloud to her
father the river-god Ladon, to change her into a reed.
Her prayer was granted. Pan consoled himself for his
disappointment by cutting (the) reeds with which

he made a flute...”’
(New Larousse Encyclopedia of Mythology,
Prometheus Press, Paris 1959, p. 161)

FOR YOUR

FEMININE

SHAVING NEEDS

POEMRY

To my rapist:
In the dark infernal gloom of a Wildean jail

graveyard circa 1979 you pose for a picture I see
in People Magazine (October, 1979)

and read you murdered your wife gave her children to strangers

“Slip of the gun” you say
They want you released.

Not a real murderer they say.
Real dead wife I say.

I know you.

Overwhelming the sensibility
of my thirteen year old body
knees and new nipples

you violated the virgin

of my syrinx spirit voice.

Piper of Panic.

I’VE NEVER LIKED THE COLOR WHITE

I’ve never liked the color white
Wearing white always meant

funerals

and weddings

and grownup parties

all of which I could never understand.
Mama would say

Girl, if you get that white dress dirty
I’m gonna beat your ass

And no matter how hard I tried

I always managed to soil that
damned pretty white dress.
White stands for purity

and goodness
and virginity
and integrity

But my skin ain’t white!

Does that make me
contaminated

You taught me poetry and swimming (and alcohol and violence) or evil

I stare at your murky picture taken that day
and smudge my hand as I rub it

I remember your hard thigh

the blond bristle of your squat hand on my
wet swimsuit against

No, I've never liked the color white
cause white always has and always will be

a burden in my life.

while nine cried black
