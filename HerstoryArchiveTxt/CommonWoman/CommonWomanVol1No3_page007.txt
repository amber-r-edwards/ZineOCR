status of  
women  

Continued from 1  

To help see these goals  
realized, the Commission  
maintains various task forces  

which examine employment,  
health, education, family  
violence, day-care, legal and  
legislative issues, and provides  

referral and informational  
services to Vermont women. In  

general, the Governor’s  
Commission on the Status of  
Women serves as an advocate for  
women throughout the state.  
The Commission has  

of interest  
These  
Job Hunt Workbook,”  

published pamphlets  
for Vermont women  
include “  

“Checklist for Wives,” “Women  
and the Law — A Handbook for  
Vermont” and an in-service  

program for teachers about  
non-traditional occupations for  
girls. The Commission newsletter  
is published 8 times yearly and  
can be obtained by writing to  
126 State Street, Montpelier or  
by calling 828-2851.  

In the past few years, the  
Commission has supported  
and/or drafted legislation  
concerning the revision of  
Vermont's rape laws; revision of  

child custody and support  
statutes; the elimination of  
sex-discrimination in  
employment, credit, and  

insurance; and the inclusion of  
wives’ names in the phone book.  
The Equal Rights Amendment  
was strongly supported and the  
recession effort was effectively  
opposed. The 1978 Mandigo  
Bill, which opposed state  
funding for Medicaid abortions,  
was defeated with the unofficial  
support of the Commission  

because CETA funds made  
lobbying illegal. Now that the  
Commission no longer receives  
CETA funds, there are no  
restrictions on lobbying  
activities.  

The Commission has  

sponsored 48 forums on Family  
Violence this year. Health Care  
facilities are surveyed and  
recommendations are made  

concerning the sensitivity to  
women’s special health care  
needs. The staff works with  

other State agencies in planning  
the integration of women into  
Vermont's labor force, at all  
levels. The legal and economic  
vulnerability of the full-time  
homemaker is recognized and  
the Commission seeks to effect  
recognition of the value of  
homemaking by changing  
insurance, tax, inheritance and  
divorce laws and regulations. In  
addition, the staff receives and  
processes sex-discrimination  
complaints from the general  
public. Individuals may write or  
call the Commission at any time  
for advice and action concerning  
sex-discrimination of all kinds.  

On November 1, 1977  
Governor Snelling received a  
letter from the U.S. Dept. of  
Labor, commending him on  
having “one of the best, most  
active Commissions on the  
Status of Women in the United  
States.” The regional  
administrator, Vivian L. Suckles,  
went on to write, “You may not  
be aware of their excellent  
national reputation or that they  

have brought about changes  
which benefit women  
throughout the country.”  
Unfortunately, the Vermont  

media did not widely publicize  
this remarkable recognition of  
excellence of the Vermont  
Governor’s Commission on the  
Status of Women.  

The Commission has recently  
hired a new Executive Director,  
Anne Sarcka of Rutland County,  
to fill the vacancy left by  
Constance Kite who failed to  
reapply for the post on June  
30th. Commissioner Chairperson  
Gloria Gill has said that Ms. Kite  
was asked not to reapply  
because of her temperament and  
a lack of administrative  
experience. 53 persons, 2 of  
them male, had applied for the  
$13,600 a year post.  

Anne Sarcka brings to the  
Commission a renewed sense of  
commitment and vigor.  

Statewide women’s groups have  
hailed her appointment as  
symbolizing a new beginning and  

unity of purpose for the  
Commission. Anne, a member of  
the Vermont National  
Organization for Women, has  
served in a variety of mental  
health and human services posts,  

and has been primarily focused  
on the special problems of  
women. After her appointment,  
Anne said:  

“I am excited that women  
have made much progress over  
the past 10-15 years. At the  
same time, I am well aware that  
after 130 years since the nation’s  
first women’s rights convention,  
we as a nation still have a long  
way to go. I’m proud of this  
state’s accomplishments, and  
believe we have a unique  
opportunity here. I hope that  
Vermont can continue to  
provide leadership, and can  
continue to be a small clear  
voice on the side of sanity and  
justice. And I look forward to  
the challenge of meeting the  
expectations of the Commission,  
as your Executive Director.”  

The women of Vermont are  

invited to contact the  
Governor's Commission on the  
Status of Women at 126 State  
Street, Montpelier, or to call  
828-2851, with their concerns.  
The Commission is for us all,  

as we utilize  

let’s support as well  
this impressive  
resource!

The Peak  

it’s too late  

the foliage is past its peak  
I’ve been told  

and all the leaves  

of last week's perfect days  
are snagged  

on my lawn  

I must have missed the peak  
that moment.  
when each ripe leaf  

came  

full circle  

I tried  

to go inside  

and build a daytime fire  

against this uncertain afternoon  
I tried  

but was startled  

by the sun  

bolting through the cabin  
drowning the light of my fire  
illuminating me from behind  
on my haunches  

in front of the smoking logs  
succumbing  

to the chill of longing  

for those earlier Falls  

these days there’s never  
the right moment  
except for now  
one year before the peak

What will the ERA do? It will  
provide constitutional  
protection for the legal strides  
that women have made towards  
equal pay for equal work, equal  
access to credit and education,  
and recognition of the  
contributions of the  
homemaker. Changes in the  
courts and legislatures have  
begun to erode the hard-won  
gains that women have made in  
the past decade. The  
insensitivity of judges to  
problems...continue

For example, a recent report in  
the Washington Post describes  
the call for an investigation of a  

Connecticut judge who, in  
a rape conspiracy  
“You can't blame  
somebody for trying.” Such men  
continue to have the power to  
define the boundaries of  
women’s fragile legal rights.

and shaved again until the end of  
the season.  

GOOCH: I get no end of shit  
because of the hair on my face.  
From kids mostly — lots of kids  
come up to me and say, “Lady,  
you have a beard!” All my girl  
friends in high school used to  
tell me I could get dates if  
I shaved my beard.  

ANN: And you were able to  

ignore that?  
GOOCH: I like my hair. It’s  
furry — I like it! But my mother  
used to try to get me to tweeze  
my eyebrows.  

BETTY LOU: My mother  
never did. I came home with  
them tweezed once and she said,  
“Gross! Don’t ever do that  
again.” And tweezing them hurt —  
they came out as if they were  
balls and chains or something.  

ANN: I remember the first  
time I saw a woman with a beard  
I was pretty freaked out. It was  
at this women's conference and  
she had blond hair and it was  
really a beard — but she wasn’t  
self-conscious or anything, so  
I said, “Well, that’s the way she is

and that's O.K." Then at one  
point during the conference,  
someone was talking about hair  
as a sign of strength. I guess  
women aren't encouraged to  
have facial hair because they’re  
supposed to look more delicate  

and passive.  
JENNIFER: What about hair  
on your head? In Indian  

mythology there’s a male god  
called Shiva who has extremely  
long hair and it’s part of his  
strength and his sexuality:  
There's a lot of mystique about  
women having really long hair —  

there's something really erotic  

about having long hair. There’s a  
lot of deep-rooted mythology  
about long hair.  

JOY: What kind of reaction  

do you get, Ellen, for having  
such short hair?  
ELLEN: I have been called  

“sir” at least four or five times  
in the last couple of months.  

NANCY: That happens to me  
all the time, too.  

ELLEN: I had pretty long  
hair before I got it cut this short.  
It was this incredibly hard  
decision, because finally I’d got  
my hair long and I was doing a  
number with it and being this  
Farrah Fawcett-Majors type with  
it all hanging down and I was  
really into it. And it was this  
incredibly hard decision for me  
to get my hair cut. I got it cut in  
inches — I would go every  
month and get like two more  
inches off and two more inches  
off. I feel that this incredible  
pressure has been lifted off me  
about my hair; my hair's always  
been very hard for me to deal  
with. Before I got my hair cut, it  
was always around, “Do men  
find me attractive or not,  
because is my hair beautiful?”  
And when I got rid of that, a  
weight lifted off me.  

GOOCH: I think that’s when  
I stopped shaving my legs — when,  
I didn't give a damn what  
anybody thought about it. I  
wear my hair on my legs and on  
my body the way it’s  
comfortable for me.  

EVE: I can remember hiking  
in Big Bend National Park and I  
was wearing shorts and a  
sleeveless shirt and I was up on  
top of this fantastic mountain. It  
was the most sensual experience,  
because the wind was ruffling  
my hair and the hair on my legs  
and the hair under my arms, and  
it was just part of the total  
experience. It was wonderful —  
I wouldn't give that up for  
anything.
