At kibbutz ktura

This is the Land?
So red?

The desert crust
crumbles under my boots
and I am as alone

as the moon.

I climb up a path

in the Arava

the rains must have made
lined with sparse acacia
and tiny winter flowers.

A lone crow

calls out proof

some creatures learn to live
on barren land.

These hills are a glowing challenge
of silence:

looming over this outpost

where my people have planted
green pepper fields

and cactus gardens

moist hope

to ease the threat

of thirst and bitter enemies
just beyond.

I climb alone

on such precarious ground
so remote

from what I’d call

my “homeland”

- if I had the choice,

But this is it.

I step through
scattered jagged stones
sometimes streaked
like tears.

Now sitting in the midst
of dusty hills

made from soft earth:
divided by halls:
I draw in the view
for balance
hope up here
besides the point,
Care is all that matters:
not to disappear
between the cracks.

I give myself
just enough time to admit
the rocks on neighboring hills
spill most remarkably

then use my hands

to drop back down through canyons

Sometimes crushing in my fingers
a few flannel leaves of plants I pass
to learn the land by scent.

To a Bug on a Balcony

She came into my life

while I was lying in a hammock ready
for whatever the day would bring

she and her family

of mere green spots with

mere black dots for eyes

“in the shade of a leaf's underside

sparkling like the jewel of spring herself.
I too glinting with pleasure.

We met as equals

both apparently meeting our needs
her alive on her leaf

me swinging on a hammock

strung across the balcony

both of us needing the warm sun
to live our lives to the fullest.

She brought with her a gift
of movement so minute

yet achingly familiar

giving birth once again

or so I thought

as she straddled the very edges of the leaf
bracing herself with back legs
stretched for strength

her full body involved

some essential push

neck and head arched

sought to me a reward

size for the morning

dying close attention

those small moments in spring

where all the filmy creatures

open up like the lifting of mist

like a dream come true.

In Memoriam to One Million Tasmanians

Today I heard

- (over a cup of coffee
_ with a woman from Australia)

that one million Tasmanians
about one hundred years ago
were slaughtered by her brothers.

The official government

of white Australia

offered white Australian boys

a hunting license to murder

every Tasmanian man

woman or child

a license to stab, beat, shoot, maim
torture to death

all the Tasmanian peoples.

There are no pure Tasmanians
left in the world now

only half-breeds

with half memories.

The Tasmanians have disappeared forever
like the passenger pigeon

like the big whale

the seals, the wolves

the polar bears (almost).

The Tasmanians no longer exist.

As for me, I’m still here

listening to this Australian woman

tell me for the first time

of another evil deed by the white boys
a new one for me.

Today I swear

if some white boy

asks me why I’m so angry

with him and his brothers

I’ll bring up the Tasmanians

ask him if he knows any

ask him where they went

ask him if he wants me to tell him more

tell him
to go to hell.

An Open Invitation to the Burlington

Wimmin’s Community
When all the dykes in Burlington
land in my living room
or even round my kitchen table
then the world will come to an end
and the Revolution will begin.

When Paij, Linda, Joni, Etana,
Carol, Robin, Josie,

Judy, Susan, Pam,

Deane, Bear, Gwyn,

Indigo, Roz, Terry,

Michiyo, Peg and Glo,

Steph, Maxine and Lynn

and all the children come
then the world, sisters,

will come to an end

and the Revolution will begin.

When Blacks, Asians, Whites,
Protestants, atheists
agnostics, Catholics, Jews
witches, hedonists, healers
all fly El Al
straight to the holy land
into my waiting arms
then all erotic energy
all hell
will break loose
and the world will have had it.
The Revolution will land
in our laps.
