SATIR COMES TO
VERMONT

Even though some of us may
be slow learners, we're all
educable and we can all change
for the better at any time in our
lives; we can even change
deep-rooted patterns of family
interaction if we want to.

This was the hopeful,
humanist message
world-renowned family therapist
Virginia Satir delivered to more
than 100 professional therapists
and over 600 non-professionals
in the University of Vermont's
Ira Allen Chapel on November
12.

Sponsored by the Creamery
Educational Foundation, Inc.,
the talk was, for the
professionals, only part of a
two-day seminar with Satir. For
the rest of the audience, it was a
$7.50-a-head, three-hour glimpse
of Satir’s ideas and techniques.

Satir, a pioneer in the field of
family therapy and the author of
several books, including
Conjoint Family Therapy and
Peoplemaking, focused in her
talk on two ways of viewing
ourselves and our world: the
traditional, hierarchical
viewpoint and the new
“organic” method.

According to Satir, each of us
has to deal with four main
phenomena — (1) how do I
define a relationship, (2) how do
I define a person, (3) how do I
explain why things happen, and
(4) how do I feel about change.

By Dian Kendrick Mueller

In the hierarchical scheme of
things, a relationship is defined
in terms of who's up and who's
down, with the people in both
positions having some bad
feelings; in this traditional
set-up, it seems “natural” that

up-down relationships exist
between husband and wife,
parent and child, boss and
worker. A person is defined as
someone who is “clean, bright,
right and still” and we are taught
that if someone is not like us, we
should “forgive” her. According
to the hierarchical view, there is
a single “right” answer to why
things happen in a certain way
and the one who has the most
power is the one who is “right;”
explanations are linear (A causes
B) and tend to support myths
that are no longer useful. Change
in this framework is viewed as
the enemy and we are
encouraged to maintain the
status quo, which means we have
to lie about reality.

In the decades since World
War II, the human potential
movement has given birth to the
new “organic” view of the
world, Satir said. In this view,
roles within a relationship are
only a function of a person, not
a definition of that person; no
one is trapped by her role. A
person is defined as a person and
all persons are equal, though
each of us is unique. (“A lot of

family trouble starts when we
assume that we are all the same.
We are not all the same, which
means I have to discover you,
rather than assuming you,” said
Satir.) Events are caused by a
cluster of factors coming
together at some particular
moment — A plus B plus C
equals D at the time; events are
caused by continual action and
reaction. In this way of looking
at the world, change is
acknowledged as inevitable and
people can then prepare for risk
taking and take the risk; security
in this system depends on the
willingness to take risks.

Satir told her audience that
we are now in a transition period
between the hierarchical view
and the organic method. She
said that our intellects may be
with the new system, but our
emotions are still entangled in
the old hierarchical view.

Satir stressed that the
hierarchical system coerces
people into action by judging
and compelling, while the
organic method persuades
people by offering a choice and
the possibility of discovery.

“It's never too late to
change,” Satir said. “There’s no
need to get bogged down by
guilt over past actions, either.
Remember, whatever you've
done, you did the best that you
could at the time.”

health, education discrimination,
labor unions, the ERA, women
and poverty, violence against
women, rural women,
sterilization, reproductive rights,
homemaker’s rights,
consciousness raising, women
and welfare, sexist justice — how
to choose which to attend?

But the Conference was not
all work, for as much as we
struggled together over political
differences during the day, we
shared our energy and enjoyed
our Sisterhood at the evening
entertainments. Saturday night
was a wonderful celebration,
with hundreds of women, and
some men, dancing to LILITH,
the women’s rock group from
Boston. Sunday night was
equally outstanding, with Gloria
Steinem introducing performers
like Jane Sapp (a Black woman
performing traditional Black
music), Kristin Lems (a woman
musician/humorist) and Margie
Adam! This concert was
followed by Claudia Weill’s film,
Girl Friends, a feminist film
about women and their support
for each other in this society.
And throughout the Conference,
the National Women's Film
Circuit films were shown,

Many non-voting attendees
and delegates looked forward to
the workshops, which were
extremely varied in scope. These

included: minority women,
lesbian rights, credit, older
women’s rights, women and

probably the largest collection
of excellent feminist films under
one roof!

The feeling of the Vermont
delegation, as we started our
12-hour drive back home, was of
accomplishment, dismay, hope
and exhaustion. We had retained
the basic democratic, grass-roots
structure of NOW, kept the
organization open to people of
all political affiliations, and had
helped set National NOW’s goals
and policies for the next two
years. And we're already making
plans to attend the 1979

Conference — in Los Angeles!
