The Rapist

Psychiatrist Suspended  
Burlington: Dr. Loy S.  
Harrell, Jr., the Burlington psy-  

chiatrist being investigated by  
legal and medical authorities for  
alleged sexual contact with  
patients, has had his privileges  
suspended at the Medical Center  
Hospital of Vermont. The sus-  
pension was announced by the  
chief of psychiatry services and  
confirmed by a hospital spokes-  
man. Harrell has been unavail-  
able for comment since the  
charges were made public and  
his attorney said he was unaware  
of the suspension. At least eight  
women have contacted the  
Chittenden County state’s  
attorney’s office about possible  
misconduct by Harrell. Once the  
investigations are completed, the  
hospital’s medical board will  
review the suspension.  

Abortion  

Pope vs. Abortion  
Vatican City: Pope John  
Paul II spoke against abortion in  
his Christmas Day blessing. A  
year ago the pope also defended  
what he called the rights of the  
unborn child in his Christmas  
message. This year he spoke of  
“basic human rights” and  
appealed for peace.  

Racism  

Death Is Constitutional  
Montgomery, Ala: The state  
Supreme Court ruled recently  
that Alabama’s 1975 death  
penalty statute is constitutional  
even though portions of it were  
struck down in October by the  
U.S. Supreme Court. Justice  
Oscar Adams, who recently  
became the first black to serve  
on the state’s highest court,  
issued a concurring opinion  
which held that the death penal-  
ty is not as “discriminatorily and  
freakishly imposed” against  
blacks as it once was. He said the  
court’s decision “has built into  
the judicial machinery checks  
against the freakish imposition  
of the death penalty.”  

Resistance  

No More Nudes  
London: About 30 angry  

feminists chanting, “No to male  
violence and an end to page 3,”  
stormed the tabloid SUN news-  
paper to protest its featured  
pictures of nude women on the  
Page, a practice that has become  
a Fleet Street institution. The  
protesters demanded the paper's  
editor replace Saturday's picture  
with a statement from them  
blasting the press for “condes-  
cending articles” on women. The  
women said the male staffers  
swore at them and told them to  
clear out.  

ATROCITIES  

Pleads Innocent  
A Richmond man pleaded  
innocent in Vermont District  
Court to one charge of lewd and  
lascivious behavior toward three  
13-year-old girls who were out-  
side his apartment November 21.  

Joseph Hubert Tremblay,  
21, of Railroad Street allegedly  
exhibited lewd behavior at his  
window while the girls were  
standing in the street, a Rich-  
mond officer said. One of the  
girls’ mothers reported the inci-  
dent.  

Tremblay faces a maximum  
sentence of five years in jail or  
a fine of $300, Chittenden County  
Deputy state’s attorney Harold  
Eaton, Jr. said.  

Woman Beaten  
A Rutland woman was  
hospitalized after her ex-hus-  
band allegedly beat and abduct-  
ed her from her apartment.  
Ronald Gene Baker, 28, of  
Rutland pleaded innocent to  

charges he assaulted his ex-wife.  
Baker is also accused of breaking  
into his ex-wife’s apartment. The  
woman told police Baker had  
threatened to kill her with a  
hatchet. Baker was jailed for lack of  
$10,000 bail, officials said.  

Lewd and Lascivious  
A 60-year-old Hyde Park  
man, James D. Felcher, of  
Vermont, has been charged with  
three counts of lewd and lascivious  
conduct with two girls,  
ages nine and 11.  

Felcher denied charges that  
he molested the girls in Johnson  
November 20, and that he  
molested the 11-year-old again  
two days later in Johnson.  

He has been found compe-  
tent to stand trial and is at the  
St. Johnsbury Correctional Cen-  
ter under $10,000 bail.

ERA  

No Communion  
New York: Karen Ladley  
was refused communion at St.  
James Church in Jamestown  
because she was wearing an ERA  
button. Mrs. Ladley wrote to  
Bishop Head about the incident  
and he replied that he was giving  
the matter his personal attention  
and that the priest had presumed  
she was a “proponent of abor-  
tion.” That's wrong! It was pure  
bad judgment, imprudent, im-  
mature and unjust. Being for  
ERA has nothing to do with  
favoring abortion. Some clergy  
and nuns favor ERA.  

No ERA?  
Washington: Election day  
did nothing to brighten the  
outlook for ERA. On the  
contrary, an analysis by NOW  
suggests that the changes in  
state legislatures have made the  
approval prospects by the re-  
quired three states even dimmer  
than they were. The women’s  
movement fared somewhat bet-  
ter in legislatures as a whole. The  
new state assemblies will include  
880 female members, 110 more  
than after the 1978 elections.  

Priorities?!  

Defense Spending  
Washington: U.S. defense  
spending early in the Reagan  
administration may need to be  
boosted by about 8 percent to 9  
percent annually, Sen. John  
Tower, R-Texas, says. Tower,  
who is in line to become chair-  
man of the Senate Armed  
Services Committee, said he  
envisions the increases tapering  
down later so that they average  
approximately 5 percent over a  
five to six year period. Tower  
made these comments in an  
interview on the Cable News  
Network.  

Shutting the Door  
Montpelier: When Congress  
terminated funding for the Law  
Enforcement Assistance Admin-  
istration last month, it may have  
shut the door on as many as 50  
social projects in the state. Many  
programs supported by LEAA,  
such as the Brattleboro Women’s  
Crisis Center, the Project Against  
Domestic Violence and many  
criminal diversion programs, will  
fall by the wayside.  

Environment  

Cancer and Fallout  
Salt Lake City: A blue-  
ribbon panel of scientists has  
concluded that exposure to  
radioactive fallout was the likely  
reason that cancer rates in  
southern Utah soared at the time  
of atmospheric atomic testing in  
Nevada, the Desert News states.  
In a copyright story, the news-  
paper reported that an unpub-  

Child Abuse  
A 7-year-old North Carolina  
girl was beaten, stabbed and  
stuffed into a hot electric oven  
by her father, she told police.  

Dontressa E. Taylor was  
listed in good condition January  
6 at the Wake Medical Center.  

When officers arrived at the  
Raleigh home of Jessie Mae  
Taylor, they found the child cut,  
bleeding and wrapped in paper  
towels.  

Police arrested Dontressa’s  
father, Donald Joseph Holmes,  
30, at the hospital where he was  
visiting the girl. Holmes is  
charged with child abuse and  
was held on $100,000 bond.  

Published report by the Interagency  
Radiation Research Committee  
said the excessively high rate of  
childhood cancer in southern  
Utah “remains unexplained on  
grounds other than possible  
fallout exposure.” Several hun-  
dred people have joined a suit  
against the government in an  
attempt to obtain damages for  
what they contend are radiation-  
caused cancers.  

Exhibitionist Arraigned  
Stephen Moon, 37, report-  
edly exposed himself to a small  
group of boys and girls, ages 5 to  
7, in Bennington.  

Moon, of Vermont, was  
arraigned in Vermont District  
Court on charges of lewd and  
lascivious conduct, Bennington  
police said. He was arrested  
January 10 after a warrant was  
issued.  

Moon is being held at the  
Bennington Police Lockup for  
lack of $10,000 bail.  

Girl Abused  
Sexual abuse of an 11-year-  
old girl was reported in Rutland  
by her mother, officials said  
January 10.  

Rutland police were told  
the girl had been sexually abused  
November 24 and an attempt  

made New Year's Eve.  

Police have an 18-year-old  
suspect. Detective Guy Paradee  
said an investigation revealed the  
abuse may have occurred over a  
couple of years.  

Blaming the Victim  
By the Edna Louise Pipkins  
Defense Committee  
On October 15, 1979, Edna  
Louise Pipkins, a 27-year-old  
mother of four children, stabbed  

her “common law” husband  
while he was choking and  
beating her. The man died the  
next day. Edna was charged with  
first-degree murder and was held  
on $100,000 bond at Niantic  
Prison, Conn.  

After Edna had been incar-  
cerated for three weeks, a bail  
hearing was held on November  
7. At that time, the charge was  
reduced to manslaughter and the  
bond was reduced to $5,000.  

Within a two-year period  
prior to the man’s death, Edna  
had repeatedly called the police  
to ask for help because this man  
was battering her. Although the  
man who was abusing her was  
arrested on several occasions and  
was found guilty of assault in  
two court hearings, the beatings  
and threats continued.  

Edna is a black woman who  
lives in a public housing project  
in Hartford, Conn. She, like  
many women in this situation, is  
trapped by her financial circum-  
stances, paralyzed by fear, and  
treated unjustly by the police,  
the courts and the helping  
professions. The problems are  
compounded when the woman is  
black, Hispanic, poor, uneducated  
and has children.  

Edna can’t fight this strug-  
gle alone. Woman beating is not  
an individual problem; it is  
society’s problem. It cannot be  
eradicated with individual reme-  
dies. We, the Edna Louise  
Pipkins Defense Committee,  
believe that the cycle of violence  
must be broken. Every woman  
has the right to defend herself  
against violence. We support this  
right for Edna, and for all  
women.  

The committee is attempt-  
ing to raise $1,200 necessary for  
Edna's defense. If you can help,  
please mail your contribution to

Kidnapping and Rape  
An Elmore man, who was  
released from prison after serv-  
ing time for the 1972 rape of a  
Vermont College student, has  
been arrested by state police for  
the alleged kidnapping and rape  

of a woman in Elmore last  
month.  

Robert Lyle Percy, 27, of  
Vermont, pleaded innocent in  
Vermont District Court to hold-  
ing a Washington County woman  
against her will and raping her in  
a remote part of Elmore December  
7.  

In 1972, Percy was given a  
six-to-12-year prison sentence in  
a plea-bargaining agreement for  
the rape of the student, for the  
kidnap of a 21-year-old South  
Burlington woman and for an  
earlier break-in and sexual  
assault in Newport.  

Percy is held on $5,000 bail.
