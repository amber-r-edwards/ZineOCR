My decision to go was a last  
minute one. I hadn’t gone last  
year and some of my friends had  
and they had felt energized by  
going. I felt I needed a little of  
that and to go and take a look at  
the enemy again, close up, to see  
if he's the same dangerous fool!  
So I went on a bus with 47  
women from Vermont and New  
Hampshire. At the White River  
bus station there were women  
everywhere, some getting on the  
bus, others making a movie of  
the parting and some women  
who had gone last year and  
wanted to see us off. One  
woman was passing out yarn and  
needles and teaching a hand  
game to be passed on. It set the  
tone.  
After a ten hour trip and  
some rest, the next day was  
workshops and a march to the  
aerospace museum at the capitol  
mall. I was disappointed in the  
march, felt it was too low key. I  
wanted more singing and louder  
and generally to take up more  
space. It seemed we were  
awfully well behaved given the  
lethargy of what we were  
protesting (the entire military  
machine and its nuclear build-  
up). The best part of the day  
was afterwards when the group  
of women I was with had a  
discussion about how we should  
unroll a prophylactic over the  
Washington monument. Like  
Christo wrapping the Palisades,  
only with meaning. Now that  
would be an action I'd like to  
participate in. I hoped there  
would be more energy the next  
day.  

Monday was the day of the  
action and we were all massed  
by eight o'clock. We proceeded  
quietly through Arlington ceme-  
tery to the Pentagon. I wanted  
more to happen, I hate behaving  
politely when facing the people  
who want to kill me. But of  
course they have all the guns.  
Our weapons have to be some-  
thing else and the statement  
from the WPA organizers  
referred to non-violence as the  
common thread that binds us.  

At the Pentagon women  
were planting markers for the  
graves of women killed by the  
patriarchy. I was moved by our  
ancient and continuing resistance. I was carrying a tomb-  
stone for El Salvadorean women  
and I wrote the name of a  
woman I knew who had been  
killed by birth control pills  
on another one. The huge white  
puppet of mourning came forth  
and the women set up a wail and  
moaned and wept. It felt power-  
ful; something the men don't  
understand, and fear. Then the  
red puppet with the words, “we  
are angry," appeared, and the  
mourning turned to anger as the  
women shouted “no! no more  
war!" and shook their fists at  
the Pentagon. Our next move  
was to encircle the Pentagon  
with a ring of women singing  
“you can't kill the spirit/she is  
like a mountain/old and strong/  
she goes on and on.” Women  
wove webs of colored cloth in  
front of the doors. The brass,  
breaking their way through these  
webs, were quite bothered.  

Men yelled at them, “shame  
shame!” and many other things.  
I think they were affected—and  
that we should not underesti-  
mate the power of symbolic  
protest. I think we should  
consider throwing lots of men-  
strual blood on the Pentagon.  
Every warrior society in the  
world has great taboos around  
that and it’s time we used their  
fear of us.  

In San Francisco a demon-  
stration in sympathy with the  
Pentagon Action was taking  
place around the Bohemian club,  
an elite pigs organization. The  
theme there, as here, was  
“women weave the web of life.”  
The motto of the Bohemian club  
is something like let no spiders  
spin their webs on us. I had an  
experience at the closing cere-  
mony that made me feel we had  
drawn power here. Women drew  
a salt circle and were encouraged  
to drop in stones that we had all  
brought signifying something we  
had to leave behind. Patriar-  
chal religion, destruction, etc. I  
dropped a stone in the circle  
saying I wished to leave women’s  
self-hatred and anger towards  
women. I no sooner stepped out  
of the circle than the button,  
one of four I was wearing, that  
said lesbiangry was pulled off  
my jacket and lost. I felt  
acknowledged. We all then  
shared singing and chants and a  
thousand loaves of bread baked  
by the women’s community  
bakery. As we left everyone  
noticed over the Pentagon, in  
fact actually a bit to the left,  
was a rainbow in a circle. Some-  
thing I had never seen before;  
it’s called a sun-dog, someone  
said.  

On Civil Disobedience  

“If everybody lay down in  
the cemetery, it would be  
incredible. But to wait for them  
to pick you up, and then to pay  
to get out...!”  

“It’s hard to imagine, things  
have gotten worse in my life  
time. I thought in 1970 it was  
the end of the world.”  

Each woman with a different  
vision, yet united.  

WOMEN'S PENTAGON  

By Dee Dee Taylor  

As I return to Vermont with  
a bus full of women from  
N.H. and Vermont who have  
shared 3 days together, I know  
the impact of our action on the  
level is small. What  
matters and stands clear in my  
mind is that we have sparked the  
life force, the force of caring of  
love, and of vitality in us and all  
people, that it will always  
survive and overcome their  
foolish greed.  

It is time again to stand up  
and let our voices be heard loud  
and clear. It is a time to organize  
all people while the issue is clear  
and emotional — the redistribu-  
tion of this country’s tax money  
to the rich at the expense of the  
poor (supply side economics),  
huge budget cuts from the social  
programs transferred to the  
shameful building up of more  
weapons systems.  

We want Bread, not Bombs!  

Women weaving, spinning,  
encircling, strangling the Penta-  
gon with our bodies and our  
woven rope of yarns, shells,  
ribbons, and silk. The power of  
the WPA is not in the numbers  
nor in the media impact, but on  
the unconscious level — the  
calling together of women’s  
collective consciousness, calling  
together of the lives and energy  
of all women who came before  
us, who live today, and who will  
live after us.  

We march through Arling-  
ton Cemetery — the rows and  
rows and rows of war dead — do  
they never learn? It is hard to  
believe that the Pentagon over-  
looks this cemetery. We encircle  
and begin rituals. The white  
puppet of mourning, we place  
the tombstones of the lost lives,  
we wail, we cry. The puppet of  
anger, red and furious; we stand  
up, shaking our fists at the  
Pentagon. We scream for an end  
to their anti-life militaristic  
policies. The puppet of defiance,  
black and powerful; we will not  
accept their oppression. We  
refuse! The brown puppet of  
action; we encircle the Pentagon  
round and round, holding hands  
until the circle is enclosed. We  
are watching, we are powerful,  
we do not accept their apocry-  
phal death psychology.  

Women begin weaving a  
giant web at the main entrances.  
About 60 or so women, who  
have chosen civil disobedience as  
their statement of opposition,  
begin to block the entrances.  
The other 2-3,000 women  
stand by giving support and  
encouragement.  

At the closing ritual, we cast  
our stones into the circle. One at  
a time we declare an end to  
suffering, to war, to violence and  
lies, to hatred, to oppression.  
The stones symbolize the casting  
away of what we don't want; we  
leave them behind. We break  
bread, bread made with flour  
from our homes. We nourish  
each other and share this experi-  
ence. The action is over. We  
head for home.  

ACTION 198

There was a moment at the  
Women’s Pentagon Action —  
when the first of 3000 women  
started moving onto the Penta-  
gon parade-ground — in which I  
could envision our takeover of  
this warrior’s society. The huge,  
smooth, 5-sided building stood  
in glaring contrast to our pre-  
sence: the women’s colors and  
chanting, placards and music  
were an unleashed challenge.  
Yes, I thought, women have  
power, and we can change the  
world.  

I was not always able to  
sustain this belief. To believe in  
any kind of revolution requires,  
in the face of seemingly insur-  
mountable obstacles, a giant leap  
of faith. We have to have faith in  
ourselves as women now, despite  
the huge power of the male  
police state and despite the  
problems and differences be-  
tween us. I was critical of some  
aspects of the Action. For  
example, there seemed to be a  
great deal of self-policing going  
on this year. I heard from  
someone who attended last year  
(I did not) that there seemed to  
be less room for individual  
creativity, more centralized  
authority among organizers. At  
times I felt like one of a herd of  
sheep, but that is probably my  
problem, not anyone else's  
doing. At other times, I wanted  
women strategically placed to  
help lead things. Some of the  
songs and chants occasionally  
dragged, sounding more like  
dirges than protest and defiance.  

Some 3000 women and  
children came to the protest, all  
at least partial believers in  
pacifist feminist resistance. I'm  
sure many only endorse some of  
the precepts of non-confronta-  
tion with police (who in D.C. are  
mostly Black), the utility of civil  
disobedience, etc. It was a small,  
symbolic protest; women ex-  
pressing their mourning and rage  
at the “imperial powers.” Whe-  
ther it was women keening and  
weeping for victims past, pre-  
sent, and future, or surrounding  
the Pentagon, or weaving webs  
of fabric in the spinster tradi-  
tion, the action had a profound  
psychic or spiritual impact.  
Although we hope to influence  
the public and our target audi-  
ence (the businessmen, warriors  
and politicians who plan for  
war), these demonstrations are  
in large part for us, to give us the  
strength to continue.  

A focal idea of the Action is  
that we women will meet the  
deadly energy of the men with  
peaceful resistance, thereby con-  
verting their mess, or at least  
retaining and creating our own,  
different power. I found myself  
wondering, “Is there time for  
these tactics? Shouldn't stronger  
statements be made?” What  
would such a strong statement  
be? Besides the fact that we  
think of strength in male-defined  
terms (it must equal force and  
violence), if we did get out of  
line in significant numbers and  
ever really threatened them it  
would only result in suppression  
and carnage on our side. (Ger-  
maine Greer articulated this  
point well in her recent speech  
in Burlington.)  

This year, as far as I know,  
60 women were arrested for  
obstruction, two who threw  
blood on the front of the  
Pentagon were arrested for  
defacing Federal property. Leg  
irons were apparently not used  
this year, and many women were  
released the same day.  

We have no option but to  
continue protesting, sick as we  
may be of returning to Washing-  
ton, to Montpelier. There may  
not be immediate results, but  
over time some change may  
result: demonstrating helped end  
the war in Southeast Asia;  
Diablo Canyon’s licensing is  
more stringent now that protes-  
ters have brought it to public  
attention. Whatever you end up  
participating in, the vital thing is  
to start caring and acting now.
