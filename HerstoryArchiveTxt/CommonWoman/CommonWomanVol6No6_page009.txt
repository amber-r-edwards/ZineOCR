Two women, working full-time in the “Blue-Collar” world,
are drawing on this experience to write The Right Wing Handbook. These two cartoons are ideas for the Handbook. The
pelican is a left-wing character who is humane, an ardent feminist
and the voice of sanity.

We would appreciate any ideas, suggestions or comments

“And What Do YOU Do?’
By An Anonymous
Dyke Seeking Work

Sometimes when people ask
me what I am, I make up answers. “I'm a brain surgeon.”
That shuts most of them up. Or
“I'm a cleaning lady!” That
shuts up the brain surgeons.

Once I was at a party of
fancy people. One guy was so
important he had 3 beepers on
his belt all at once, “And what
do you do?” (Shall I say, “I'm
unemployed, and make $4 an
hour when I’m employed?”
Shall I say, “I’m a woman
identified-woman, with a special
sense of humor. I’m sitting here
right now as a matter of fact,
noticing that you boys have the
fancy jobs, and the women are
your wives, and it's making me
want to throw up all over your
expensive suit.”) I say, “I'm
writing a book." “Oh, how
interesting! What is it about?”
“Relationships.” (Shall I tell
them it’s about lesbian relation-
ships?)

Name.

I'm not a carpenter, cook,
teacher, cleaning lady, painter,
typist, etc. just because I've
done those things, Or I guess I
am all those things, the way they

The way I understand it
is that we finally stopped
being so arrogant and

looked to some of our
role models

mean it when they ask what I am.

Occupation: witch, musi-
cian, healer, creatress, survivor,
fighter, Amazon.

Occupation: woman-
identified-woman with a special
sense of humor

I’m a woman-identified
woman. That's what I am,
That's what has stayed with me,
while I do various things to pay
the rent, and while my parents
wait nervously for me to get
married, or at least to get a
career. My identity as a woman
identified-woman doesn’t get me
jobs or pay. It does get me
sanity. Each time I see/experi-
ence another daily or global
“atrocity” done on womyn, I
know why my priorities are the
way they are, and why I do the
work I do.

They say we in the women’s
movement don’t have any sense
of humor. There are many of us
in this job classification. When
we walk down Church St, at
night, and see no other womyn
alone, and lots of men, we are
not amused. We stage a take
back-the-night march. When we
go to a kids’ play, and see 12
strong male roles and two
wimpy womyn’s roles, we are
not amused, and write new
plays. When we apply for

a special sense of

promotions and the boss and
supervisor and his supervisor and
his supervisor are all men, and a
man gets the promotion, we are
not amused, and we file class
action suits. When we go canoe
ing, and see 25 boats with men
and boys out fishing, and know
that the moms are home with
the kids and the potato salad, we
are not amused. We live apart
from men, and our daughters
learn to paddle. When we see in
the paper that the new Ms.

Vermont, a pre-med student,
won a scholarship to cosmeto-
logy school, we are angry, and
picket the beauty contest. When
we see Ms. magazine on the store
rack between Hustler Magazine
and Ladies Home Journal we
throw paint on the rack and rip
up the magazines. When I go for
new shoes, and see the men’s

humor

sturdy ones, and flimsy, imprac-
tical (even dangerous) ones for
womyn, I get angry. I buy men’s
clothes. When the mechanic calls
me ‘sir’ by mistake, and then
gets embarrassed and calls me
‘dear’ instead, I learn to fix my
car myself. When the boys in the
gray flannel army cut day-
care and welfare, and increase
military spending and military
aggression, I am not surprised. I
am not amused. When I see the
womyn and kids in the welfare
office, I wonder just what has
changed. I see there is much
more work to do.

When I go into a pizza place
in the middle of the afternoon,
and it’s full of college boys,
eating and drinking, I wonder
where the college womyn are.
Are they being good girls
studying? Or are they not here
because they have only 57 cents
to spend, to each boy’s dollar?
When I turn on the radio and
listen to the sexist songs, I am
tired. When I go to a progressive
benefit, and hear all male
performers singing sexist songs, I
am angry, and write new songs.
When the boys with the crosses,
or stars of David, or crystal
mandalas or whatever, talk
about the brotherhood of man,
I do not feel enfolded in love. I
find other ways to experience
spirituality.

When I see that the majority
of people in mental institutions
and therapy are womyn, when I
hear skinny womyn agonizing
about being fat, or for that
matter, fat womyn agonizing
about being fat, when I read the
KKK is marching in Washington,
when I read in the NYTimes,

“a wise cunt won’t
swallow anything
especially not
fallacies”

~ WANTED:

that feminism is a thing of the
past, I can’t find my sense of
humor. I make a
commitment to
fostering change.

And I do have a sense of
humor. A special sense. When
I see the Curfew the Men poster
on the front of the Free Press, I
am amused. When I read of
witches casting spells on Liver-
more Labs (California, nuke
research), I am amused. When I
see a nuke plant shut down, I am
amused. When I see a lesbian
mother win custody of her
children, I am amused.

I am amused: Not often
enough. My work doesn’t keep
me paid, or laughing. It keeps
me sane and alive. PAID WORK.
