A Videotape About Battered Women

By Bear

It was the voices of the
women that reached through the
trappings of the video equip-
ment and official surroundings.
The voices of battered women
testifying at a U.S. Civil Rights
Commission hearing in Connecti-
cut were angry and scared. Their
testimony, along with that of
police, prosecutors, court offi-
cials, judges, and women who
work with support groups and
shelters, was recorded on video-
tape by Dottie Shami and
Eggplant Media Productions of
Glastonbury, Conn. The 58-
minute tape, “Coming Out of
Violence,” was shown to a
capacity audience of about 75
people, mostly women, at the
Image Co-op in Montpelier.

The women in the tape were
young, old, black, Hispanic, and
white. Some of the women gave
their testimony anonymously,
out of fear. The specifics of the
stories were different, but the
theme of abuse, physical and
emotional, was the same. They
told of watching their mothers
be abused, of being beaten,
kicked, slapped, threatened, of
trying to protect their children.

Sometimes they told of hiding
the bruises from shame. They all
told of the terror of living in an
abusive situation. They told of
police talking them out of
pressing charges, of husbands
released from jail in a few hours,
of having no legal protection
from their batterers, of light
sentences handed down by
courts. Sometimes they told of
leaving, of trying to raise three
or four or more children on
welfare allotments of $300 a
month.

The men were police cap-
tains, court officials, public
prosecutors, and judges. When
asked why so few batterers are
prosecuted (less than 3% of all
batterers arrested, and there are
few arrests), the men said, “The
system is fine. It’s the fault of
the women. Get them to prose-
cute and the system will work.”

The women spoke of fear,
of open harassment by officials,
of having no money and little
power. A shelter worker from
Transition House in Cambridge,
Mass., gave a clear analysis of the
source of battering and the
neglect of its victims: battering

comes from the pervasive view
of women as property of men; it
continues because the criminal
justice system is made up of men
who have, or want to have,
property of their own to use as
they wish; women stay because
they have no economic power.

The Hispanic women from
the shelters talked about life in
the Barrio and the Latin male’s
compulsive masculinity, machis-
mo. They said they encouraged
changes in each other’s lives,
seeing themselves as capable and
independent. They give referrals,
information, advocacy, and
support. They spoke of needing
advocates for Hispanic women
who face discrimination in hous-
ing and in the legal system in
part because of the language
barrier.

The Civil Rights Commis-
sion made recommendations,
published in a book made

available to state government.
Most of the recommendations
involve training and seminars for
police, officials, and judges to be

Open Letter on Closed Program

To: Marcia Marshall and others
involved in making the videotape
on Domestic Violence (to be
shown July 21, Channel 22, at
6:30 p.m.), funded by the
Council on the Humanities.
From: Joknee and Renee, Wom-
en’s House of Transition, Bur-
lington

Date: July 13, 1979

Every woman lives with the
fear of being beaten, harassed
and raped in her everyday life.
Every woman has been taught to
be passive and to accept these
conditions as normal. Every
woman is taught she is weak and
must be protected and depen-
dent. In this way, every woman
is a battered woman.

We see domestic violence as
part of a cycle of oppression
which exists and exploits wom-
en, children, nonwhites and poor
people and non-heterosexual
persons. The cycle of female
passivity, guilt, violence and
male socialization (to be tough,
to take what they want and
“need”) are all part of a culture

which allows and perpetuates
violence against women.

We believe this is scary and
people would rather turn off
than open themselves to the
depressing reality of our culture,
which condones and perpetuates
rape and domestic violence.

When Marcia Marshall spoke
to two members of the Women’s
House group, she stressed that
the main focus of her videotape
project was to show ways in
which our culture condones
violence. She said she would also
like to interview us to be in her
videotape as resource people.
As a volunteer organization, we
have found it necessary to
recognize our limits and give our
priority time and energy to
working with the battered wom-
en and their children. Keeping
up the house as a shelter, run-
ning a 24-hour hotline and
fundraising money for mortgage,
utilities, long distance phone
calls, emergency food and trans-
portation, all demand our imme-
diate attention and leave us little

for other projects.

After talking with Marcia,
our group decided that a project
such as hers was important. On
June 30 we spent two hours
being interviewed on cassette
tape and provided Marcia with
lots of information and resour-
ces. At that time, she arranged
for us to have a final interview
on Wednesday, July 11, which
would be videotaped for presen-
tation.

Over the next week, we
gathered and dropped off more
literature at their office. We
spent many hours discussing
among ourselves in preparation
for the final interview. We put a
lot of energy into contacting and
talking with women who had
stayed at the shelter, in response
to Marcia’s request to help her
find “battered women” for the
taping on July 11.

On Monday, July 9, after
many attempts to reach Marcia
on the phone to confirm our

ANTI-MALE?

By Vicki Smith
A harsh criticism it is these
days — “anti-male.” Lesbian
womyn, especially separatists,
and their politics are invalidated
and ridiculed as “anti-male.”

What is anti-male? Is it not
healthy for a womyn in a culture
that is run by men, owned by
men and dominated by male
values to distrust men? I am
angry, rebellious, confrontive,
raging at men. Men rape my
mind, my body, the earth. Men
cut out womyn’s clitorises to
keep us faithful, cut out our
tongues to keep us quiet, cut out
our uteruses because we don’t
“need” uteruses past childbear-
ing age. Am I “anti-male” for
exposing these realities? Am I a
manhater by refusing to forget
that six million witches-womyn
were burned in Europe because
men got frightened of womyn’s

Taking

By Donna Gordon

Every day in the streets of
our cities and towns hundreds of
women are harassed. Whether it
be a mild teasing or a vicious
rape, these attacks all have their
effect on us. Lately, more and
more women are fighting back.
Through our own culture, or-
ganizations and actions we are
gaining strength. The following
is a story about a group of
women who fought back.

One day during the 1977
Christmas season a friend of
mine (for the purposes of this
story we will refer to her as
“G”) was doing some fund-
raising on Church St. for an
alternative school. While she was

out there with her plastic smile
and “ladies” clothes, a man
approached her. He “teased” her
about the work she was doing,
dropped some line about the
hotel he was staying at in
Burlington and sauntered away.
G was repulsed, but she contin-
ued working.

Mr. Slime returned and
propositioned her to meet him
at his hotel that night. She’d had
it. She followed him into a local

bar, yelling out what a jerk he
was. In the bar he handed her a

$100 bill to get rid of her, but
she crumpled the bill up and
threw it back. The woman
bartender threw her out, not Mr.
Slime.

That night she was telling a
group of us about the incident.
Our anger stirred and we decided
to go after the creep. Later that
night 15 of us approached a
fancy hotel on Williston Rd. G
and another woman in the group
went inside to look for him, but
he wasn’t there. While the rest of
us were waiting outside some
guy went past us into the hotel.
Two or three of us looked at
each other and said, “I’ll bet
that’s him.” Sure enough it was.
We followed him into the bar.
What a wonderful scene!

We surrounded him. While
staring him straight in the face, I
started telling him what a
bastard he was and that it was
going to cost him at least $100
to get us off his case. I warned
him he'd better never do any-
thing to harass another woman
again. The rest of the women
stared at him and continued
shouting at him as he squirmed.
He finally handed us a $100 bill,
but we weren't finished. We
