LETTER FROM  
THE COLLECTIVE

The Commonwoman Collective grew out of a shared vision and  
a need to have a publication by and for women in Vermont.  
We are a collective of twelve feminists with diverse life-  
styles and backgrounds. We envision Commonwoman as a forum  
for feminists separated by class, politics, economics,  
theology, and sexual preference. Commonwoman is also an  
exploration and celebration of our similarities.

We will consider for publication all articles submitted  
by women. Since we wish to provide space for dialogue, we  
especially encourage letters and articles which are in response  
to published articles.

We are organized as a not-for-profit corporation. Manage-  
ment, decision making, and daily operations are shared by  
all. At this point, we are not able to pay ourselves for  
our work, nor can we offer money to contributors. A state-  
ment of our financial position is available on request,  
and will be printed in future issues...LET'S DEPEND ON  
EACH OTHER!

COMMONWOMAN an uncommon newspaper.

In THE City OF  
WOMEN FOR only  
A FEW WEEKS WHEN  
SHE MEETS.

HR 6869:

Bill of Rights?

By Josie Schneiderman

Remember S-1, that  
horrendous legacy of the Nixon  
era, cleverly disguised as a  
reorganization of the Federal  
Criminal Code? That legislative  
ghost of repression's future,  
which would seriously threaten  
civil liberties. Wasn't it defeated?

No, not defeated. It has been  
reworked and is just as repressive  
as ever. But governmental  
Newspeak makes the bill hard to  
spot. When governments want to  
enact a bill which will seriously  
curtail civil liberties, they  
destroy name recognition. S-1 is  
dead, but its monster children  
S-1437 and HR 6869 are very  
much alive. S-1437 has already  
passed the Senate. Hearings on  
HR 6869 are already over in the  
House and a six-week mark-up  
period ended June 21. The bill is  
700 pages long. It includes such  
niceties as re-enactment of the  
death penalty on a Federal level,  
and would nullify freedom of  
speech and freedom of assembly.  
No amount of marking will  
make this bill reasonable.

The women’s movement has  
always been a threat to the  
federal government. We can no  
longer be brainwashed, coerced  
or threatened into submission.  
The remaining governmental  
alternative is to make many  
actions of women’s rights groups  
illegal. Here's what lays in store:  
Obstructing a Government  
Function by Physical  
Interference

Any physical interference or  
obstacle which blocks a  
government function could  
result in up to one year in  
prison. This could include a  
demonstration which partially  
blocked a post office, as well as  
demonstrations in front of  
government offices, of course.  
Conspiracy, Attempt and  
Solicitation

You don't even have to go to  
the demonstration. If you attend  
a meeting where one person  
suggests illegal activity, you  
could be held liable. For  
example, say Anita Bryant were  
coming to speak. In your  
planning meetings for a counter  
demonstration someone suggests  
assassination (even in jest).  
Everyone at the meeting could  
be liable for conspiracy to  
murder even if it was never even  
discussed beyond the suggestion.  
This section could also be used  
to harass any member of a  
group, making them liable for  
the offenses of agent  
provocateurs.

Making a False Statement

A false statement to an FBI  
agent could result in Federal  
prosecution. No witnesses, no  
oath, no counsel are required. It  
would be your word against the  
agent's. (It's a good idea never to  
volunteer even a lie to an FBI  
agent. The best way to deal with  
them is to close the door in their  
face after saying that you have  
nothing to say to them.)  
Demonstrating to Influence a  
Judicial Proceeding

This provision prohibits any  
demonstration within 100 ft. of  
a Federal courthouse while any  
proceeding is in progress, or at  
any time within 100 ft. of a  
building occupied by a judicial  
official. Many of our battles are  
currently being fought in the  
courts (rape, reproductive  
choice, gay rights). So, in this  
provision many feminist  
demonstrations would become  
illegal.

Obscenity

From a feminist perspective  
this provision is perhaps the  
most far-reaching. It makes it a  
felony to mail any materials  
which “directly or indirectly”  
give information about  
procuring abortions. The statute  
prohibits “every written or  
printed card, letter or notice”  
giving abortion information, or  
for any “indecent and immoral  
purpose.” That includes  
homosexuality.

Activities of groups such as  
Planned Parenthood, Women’s  
Health centers, Gay Rights  
organizations would become  
illegal. The statute describes  
obscenity as immoral by  
“community standards.”  
Standards are defined as those of  
the “local community in which  
the obscene material is  
disseminated.” You would  
commit a felony if you mailed a  
copy of Ruby Fruit Jungle (by  
Rita Mae Brown) to your sister  
in Dade County, Florida.

S-1437 was spearheaded by  
Ted Kennedy, everyone's  
favorite liberal. One argument in  
favor of it is the expanded  
protection it would give to rape  
victims. Does it really protect?

Both Rape and Sexual Assault  
are defined as being committed
