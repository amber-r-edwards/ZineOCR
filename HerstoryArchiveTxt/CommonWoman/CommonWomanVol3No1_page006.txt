EATUIRIES

By Susan Linskey

As October began, the
nation’s day care programs were
greeted with a strong threat
from the federal government.
Congress passed a budget which
includes huge cuts to all social
services, especially day care.
Meanwhile, a five percent across-
the-board increase was included
for the Defense Department.

This budget put a limit on
Title XX monies — the main
source of day care funding in
this country. The ceiling on
money applies to both direct
services to families and training
for day care workers. Training
for day care staff is a large part
of Vermont's Title XX training
program, and would be seriously
affected by a federal cap on
expenditures. Most immediately
affected would be special needs
children who have been able to
be mainstreamed at the most
vital time in their development,
thanks largely to Title XX
monies which have been used to
train staff members in how to
meet the very real special needs
of these children.

Furthermore, the Carter
administration has proposed
several changes to the Aid to
Needy Families with Children
(ANFC) welfare program. One
change would reduce the amount
that could be spent on day care
by a welfare family to $160
(presently it is $180) per month
per child. As a result, these
families would be forced
to obtain less expensive, lower
quality care. In other words,
back to the television set, kids.
Eventually, the “privileged class
will be the only ones with access
to developmental day care
homes or day care centers.
Before all of this came down,
day care homes and day care
centers were just barely survi-
ving. The threats of further cuts
shook us all very much.

In Burlington, as in other
cities, we have formed a Burling-
ton Area Day Care Coalition, to
keep ahead of the cutting game
for day care. We had decided to
work on updating the oppressive
Social Rehabilitative Services’
(SRS) parent fee scale. This fee
scale, which has not been
adjusted since 1976, states that
families with two parents work-
ing at minimum wage ($2.90 per
hour) and having up to two
children are not eligible for any
SRS funding. In addition, this
scale often prohibits people
from accepting raises or promo-
tions because a small increase in
wages may very well mean they
lose all their day care funding,
more than negating the raise.

Threatened by the federal
cuts, we day care advocates were
forced to put aside our work on
the parent fee scale to try to
prevent this new wound from
the federal government. We have
had an effect on the legislature
in that both houses of Congress
have now passed amendments
restoring a small part of the
funds previously cut. The Senate
version provides slightly more
money than the House of
Representatives version. Presently
there is a conference commit-
tee working on this bill, H.R.
3434, to decide the exact
formula to be used — in other
words, exactly how much Title
XX training money for day care
will be available. We beg not to
be cut when, really, given the
needs of the children, our funds
should be increased.

Senator Russell Long is the
chairperson for this conference
committee. Write to him, if you
can (Senate Office Building,
Washington, D.C. 20510), to
demand more money for day
care.

Now, after a delay and an
energy drain, we are back to the
basic issues. Day care needs help,
children and parents need help,
people do have the right to
work. A six percent official
unemployment rate (tremendously
underestimated) proves
once again that our government
is run by corporations looking
for a cheap desperate labor pool.
When our economy tightens up,
day care services — like workers,
especially women workers — are
short-changed.

All of the people of this
country have a right to work.
More than that, there is no
shortage of necessary, vital work
that needs doing. Instead of
more unemployment and less
day care, a living wage and an
expanded system of child care
should be available to allow us
all to address the pressing needs
we see all around us: seriously
substandard housing; cold and
hungry people; violence against
women and children; parks that
need repairing; inadequate mass
transit systems; alternative energy
sources and on and on. While
we fight to save and expand day
care programs, we need also to
remember how these issues are
all connected to each other.
