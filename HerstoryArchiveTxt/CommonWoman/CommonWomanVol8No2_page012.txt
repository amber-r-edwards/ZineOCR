The first national radical feminist organization has recently been formed. The Radical Feminist Organizing Committee is composed of women from every region of the country and from Canada. Some of its members are new to the movement. Others were instrumental in creating the women’s liberation movement in the late 60s. RFOC was created to provide both a forum for the development of theory and strategy and a center for action.

RFOC seeks to build a strong independent women’s movement to struggle collectively against male supremacy. It is not sex roles, bad laws, or "the system" that are the problem. Men as a group are the problem, and they have to change. They will not change, they will not stop oppressing women, until we organize to stop them.

Radical feminist politics is the only requirement for membership. We will not work with anyone who advocates heterosexual or lesbian chauvinism. Two types of memberships exist, one active and one at-large. Both types of membership require agreement with the principles set forward by RFOC. To receive the principles and dues information, write to the Radical Feminist Organizing Committee, 109 Ellerbee St., Durham, N.C. 27704. We will send you more information.

Lesbian Rights Lawsuit

A lawsuit dealing with lesbian and gay employment rights took a big step forward on August 19 when a Suffolk (MA) Superior Court judge ruled in favor of the lesbian plaintiff on a pre-trial motion for summary judgment. The plaintiff, Christine Madsen, is a former editor and writer for The Christian Science Monitor. She is suing the Boston-based newspaper and its parent company, the Christian Science Publishing Society, for breach of contract, discrimination on account of her sexual orientation, and abridgement of her civil rights. Their address is: Madsen Legal Fund, Box 314, New Town Branch, Boston, MA 02258, if you want to send a contribution or want more information.

Northampton Gay March

GALA (Gay and Lesbian Activists) is presently organizing the third annual Lesbian/Gay Liberation March in Northampton. This rally is one of only three such marches in New England and, after Boston, the oldest in the region. Last year’s demonstration drew over 1500 spirited people. This strong show of support for the local lesbian and gay community in our struggle for freedom and respect was particularly appreciated given the wave of harassment at the time. The diversity of groups and individuals, straight and gay, people of color, old and young, made last year’s march an inspiring event and we plan to have an even more powerful demonstration on May 12th.

For information, write GALA, Box 1084, Northampton, MA 01061 or call (413) 586-9340.

Studies

Three Institute communities are planned for the Summer of 1984. A new program in Egypt is planned for May 24 to June 18. Classes will examine the unique aspects of women in both ancient and modern Egypt, as well as create a contemporary women’s community. Travel to cities and archaeological sites will concentrate on learning about and developing international feminism and feminist spirituality. The program in Greece will take place June 18 to July 16, and the one in Israel from July 23 to August 20. Information can be obtained through the International Women’s Studies Institute, c/o Tara Travel, 681 Market Street, Suite 629, San Francisco, CA 94105. 800-227-5116.

Fail Housing Bill

Commonwomon just got word from V.L.G.R. (Vermont Lesbian/Gay Rights) that the fair housing bill in Montpelier, Vermont House H254 does not include sexual orientation, or, in other words, lesbian/gay rights to having housing. If you wish to write and protest this being dropped out, you can write to the following people on the House Judiciary Committee in the following list. (Note: "D" is Democrat and "R" is Republican.)

Additionally, there is a strong possibility that the bill will die a quiet death without even a hearing. Write or call the following people to insist that the bill be given a public hearing.
