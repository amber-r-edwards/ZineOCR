Bottled Death for the Third World

“A short while ago... the
Nestlé representatives came to
visit us at Nairobi’s hospital to
ask if we had any opinion about
the publication ‘Nestlé Kills
Babies.’ They really wanted us
to say that Nestlé did not kill
babies... I mentioned that there
was a child in our emergency
ward... who was very near to
death, because the mother was
bottle-feeding with the Nestlé
product and out of interest I
asked whether they would like
to see the baby. I took the two
representatives over into our
emergency ward and as we
walked in the door the baby
collapsed and died. I tried to
revive the child, but I was
unsuccessful. And, after the
baby was pronounced dead,
we all watched the mother turn
away from the dead baby and
put the can of Nestlé’s milk in
her bag before she left the
ward... It was a vivid demonstra-
tion of what bottle-feeding can
do, because this mother was
perfectly capable of breast-
feeding. The two gentlemen
walked out of the room, very
pale, shaken and quiet and there
was no need to say anything
more...”

Dr. Elizabeth Hillman

Pediatrician speaking to

United Nations Develop-

ment Forum, 1976.

This is not an isolated
incident. Many women in Third
World countries are turning
away from breast-feeding and
toward bottles filled with an
artificial milk formula. Among
the affluent, the choice between

breast-feeding and bottle-feeding
is based on personal convenience
or lifestyle, and because they
have the money and the proper
facilities to prepare the milk
formula, either proves satisfac-
tory. But among the poor,
especially in developing coun-
tries, the decision to bottle-feed
has very different implications.

Breast-feeding, even when
the mother is not properly
nourished, will supply an infant
with adequate nourishment for
the first four to six months of
life. Due to the high cost of
artificial formulas and the need
for sanitary preparatory facili-
ties, bottle-feeding often pro-
vides the infant with an over-
diluted, contaminated formula.
The decision between breast-
feeding and bottle-feeding may
be a choice between health and
disease.

Artificial milk formulas can
be an alternative to breast-
feeding for the five percent of
women unable to breast-feed.
But first, the following condi-
tions must be satisfied. There
must be sufficient income, ac-
cess to clean water, heating and
refrigeration facilities, and the
ability to read and follow the
directions for making the formu-
la.

First, a family must have
sufficient income to buy ade-
quate amounts of infant formu-
la. The fact is that a working
person in Uganda would have to

spend 33 percent of the average
wage to feed an infant artificial
milk; in Pakistan, 40 percent. In
Haiti a secretary, a relatively
well-paid worker, would spend
25 percent of her/his salary for
infant food. To feed one four-
month-old infant in Guatemala
would require almost 80 percent
of the per capita income.

There is no denying that
artificial milk formula is expen-
sive and few have enough money
to buy adequate amounts. As a
result, mothers stretch the sup-
ply of formula by diluting it
with more water than is called
for in the directions. In 1969, a
survey of Barbados residences
was performed to find out how
long a one-pound can of formula
lasted when feeding a two-
month-old. Only 18 percent said
that one pound lasted four days,
roughly the correct number of
days. However, 82 percent
reported that the one can supply
lasted anywhere from five days
to three weeks.

A professor of nutrition in
Nigeria, Dr. Adewale Omelolu,
treated a severely malnourished
baby who was being bottle-fed
at the time. He reported that for
a month the child had been
living on water from a bottle
because it took that long to save
up enough money for a can
of formula.

A second requirement for
safe use of formula is a clean
water supply for washing the
bottles and nipples as well as
preparing the formula. In Indo-
nesia, only 10 percent of all
families have access to a safe
water supply. Babies are bottle-
fed formulas mixed with water
from contaminated supplies in

areas which lack proper washing,
refrigeration, or heating facili-
ties. Malnutrition and exposure
to disease often cause chronic
diarrhea and the infant is conse-
quently unable to assimilate
nutrients even from diluted
formula. Most of these children
could have been breast-fed and
then would not be affected by
contaminated water supplies.

The final conditions for safe
use of formula include access to
heating and refrigeration and the
ability to read and follow the
directions for making formula.
Only half of all Brazilian families
have electricity, let alone refri-
gerators. In more rural parts of
Brazil, only 11 percent have
electricity. Furthermore, barely
16 percent of the women in
Haiti are literate, and usually in
Creole and French. Many Hai-
tian grocery stores carry formula
cans with instructions in English
or Spanish only.

Even among those who are
literate and are given the instruc-
tions in their native language,
many times it is impossible to
follow the directions given. In
West Africa, Nestlé’s Mother
Book, distributed by the com-
pany in Malawi, reads: “Wash
your hands thoroughly with
soap each time you have to
prepare a meal for baby.” The
fact is that about 66 percent of
the households are without a
place to wash. The text of
another baby care booklet reads:
“Place bottle and lid in a sauce-
pan of water with sufficient
water to cover them. Bring to a
boil and leave boiling for ten
minutes.” Beside the text is a
picture of an aluminum sauce-
pan on an electric stove. Electric
stoves are a rarity in West
Africa. Often the only heat
source is three stones supporting
a pot above a wood fire. The
importance of sterilization is not
obvious, so mothers frequently
skip this portion of the instruc-
tions.

Why are mothers switching
to milk formula? Right down to
the last minutes of their babies’
lives, mothers are led to believe
that they did the best thing for
their child by feeding her/him
from a bottle. The film Bottle
Babies shows a child’s grave near
Lusaka, Zambia. Lying on the
grave is a crushed milk can and a

baby bottle. The narrator of the
film says: “Mothers put empty
Nestlé Lactogen cans and feed-
ing bottles on their dead babies’
graves, for they believe to the
end that powdered milk and
feeding bottles were the most
valuable possessions their babies
once had.” In actuality, it was
the bottle and formula that
hastened the infant's death.

The problem started in the
1960s when the numbers of
babies born in Western countries
began to decline. The formula
producing companies were
forced to seek new markets
outside of affluent countries.
For most their hopes tie in
developing countries where the
birth rate is high. Widespread
promotional advertising of
infant foods appeared through-
out the Third World. Nestlé has
81 plants in 27 underdeveloped
countries and 728 sales centers
around the world.

One way of promoting
infant products is through radio
and poster advertising. As
Frances Moore Lappé writes:
“Exposed to countless bill-
boards, newspaper advertise-
ments, and color posters, parents
in under-developed countries
come to equate a happy, healthy
baby with a bottle or a can of
Lactogen. They learn that educa-
ted and upper-class families use
feeding bottles. They too want
the best for their baby.” What
the posters do not say, though,
is that in some cases bottle
feeding kills.

Another method of promot-
ing milk formulas is through
health professionals. This invol-
ves providing hospitals with free
posters, calendars, literature,
and, most importantly, free
samples of the company's pro-
duct. It is particularly beneficial
to sales of a product, but causes
alarming results. The real tra-
gedy of this gimmick is that
mothers receiving free sam-
ples from the hospital use
them until they run out, mean-
while allowing their own breast
milk to dry up. Unless the breast
is stimulated from immediately
after birth, the supply can-
not be tapped. Hence, mo-
thers taking advantage of the
free samples from the hospital
are forced to continue buying
formula.

To further promote their
product, formula companies hire
“milk nurses” to make contact
with new mothers. In Jamaica,
milk nurses are official nurses
who go through a six-week
training by the company. During
this time they learn about the
product and receive a fixed
salary plus traveling expenses.
Often the wage that the com-
panies can pay is much greater
than the money earned working
as a public health person, so the
job promoting formula is diffi-
cult to refuse. Not only does this
take women out of valuable
positions in public health where
they are most needed, but also
mounts women against women
in a situation where they most
need to help each other.

Because of these promo-
tional gimmicks, infant malnu-
trition, kwashiorkor (the resulting
disease), and infant mortality are
on the rise in Asia, Africa, and
Latin America. In Europe and
more recently in the U.S.,
increasing numbers of people are
refusing to purchase any product
with a Nestlé trademark until
the company stops promoting
infant formula. In Burlington,
the boycott of Nestlé products
has piqued the interest and
concern of many. Last Saturday
morning on the sidewalk next to
the Grand Union downtown, a
group of 30 (the youngest being
Emily, age four months) par-
aded, petitioned, and passed out
information on the boycott
to shoppers as they entered
the store. During Lent local
people joined others across the
country in clipping and collect-
ing Nestlé coupons appearing in
newspapers and magazines. On
April 19, all the coupons were
made into papier-mâché baby
bottles, sent back to Nestlé,
or destroyed. This symbolic
gesture in effect said to Nestlé:
“No way are we buying any of
your products, despite your
millions of money-saving cou-
pons. Not until you change your
ways!” The Women’s Refer-
ral Center at UVM has sponsored
a petition drive in the past four
months. They have gathered an
estimated 600 signatures and
intend to send these to Nestlé
next week.

There is much evidence
indicating that the boycott is
affecting Nestlé where it hurts
most. Nestlé stocks are down,
the company has distributed
anti-boycott propaganda to liter-
ally every minister and every
food service in the U.S., and
other brand names are slowly
replacing the Nestlé label on the
grocery store shelves. Unfortu-
nately though, the struggle is not
over yet.

The following is a list of
boycott items:
Nestlé Quik and Chocolates,
Nescafé, Nestea, Taster’s Choice,
Sunrise Instant Coffee, Soup-
time, Stouffer’s Brand, Libby's
Brand, Crosse and Blackwell.
Other Nestlé products include:
Maggi Soups, James Keller and

Son, Ltd., Crawford products,
Deer Park Mountain Spring
Water, Gerber Cheeses, Swiss

Knight Cheese, Provolone Loca-
telli, Kavli Crispbread, Hum,
Pero, Wispride, McVities, Keiller,
and Major Grey's Chutney.
When joining the boycott, be
sure to tell Nestlé of your
decision. Write to: Mr. David
Guerrant, The Nestlé Company,
Inc. 100 Bloomingdale Rd.,
