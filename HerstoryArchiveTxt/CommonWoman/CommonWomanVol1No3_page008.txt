Tae Kwon Do Classes

TAE KWON DO

Extending from the northeast
corner of China into the Yellow
Sea and the Sea of Japan is the
peninsula of Korea, a divided
country since 1950. Peaceful
and serene on first glance, this
little country instead represents
the discipline and understanding
that come from years of invasion
and oppression. Ruled by China
from 103 B.C. until 200 A.D.
and by Japan from 1910 until
1945, Korea enjoyed a mere five
years of freedom in this century
before engaging in a civil war,
symbolizing the engagement of
the Communist and so-called
“Free” Worlds. Today the two
countries exist side by side,
North and South Korea,
inhabited by a lineage that dates
back well over 30,000 years.
Martial arts in Korea had their
beginning centuries before the
birth of Christ. Included as part

of the soldiers’ overall military
experience is training in the
advantages and possibilities of
the body's natural weapons; and
the skills of unarmed combat
were emphasized. In this manner
a branch of military science
based upon the natural weapons
of fists, hands, and feet was
established. First known as
Subak and then, over the
centuries, called Kwon Bup and
Tae Kyon, it was a vital part of a
warrior’s training. The name Tae
Kwon Do (the way of fist and
foot fighting) was chosen in
1955 by a group of leaders in
the art, and it was officially
adopted by the Republic of
Korea in 1965.

Tae Kwon Do, Korean Karate,
emphasizes strikes and kicks and
the blows are aimed at sensitive
body parts. A person skilled in

Tae Kwon Do could kill or
seriously injure an opponent
with a single blow and therefore
the techniques are used in
emergencies. Although it
requires only speed and training
and not strength for this fighting
art, women were not taught the
art until after World War II.
From a popular viewpoint, Tae
Kwon Do students obtain the
impressive skill of breaking
boards and bricks with their
hands and feet.
June, 1978, Kyong-Ae took the
first U.S. Women’s team to
Seoul, Korea, to participate in
the Pre-World Tae Kwon Do
Championships.

How does Tae Kwon Do
differ from Judo? Both martial
arts originated in China, but
whereas Tae Kwon Do is
offensive, Judo (derived from
ju-jitsu) is primarily defensive.
The latter involves using the
attacking weight of an opponent
for throwing. Both require
discipline and an attitude of
personal power, but Tae Kwon
Do has become more prominent
than any other martial art in
strengthening and cultivating the
body and mind.

In the town of Kinchom,
Korea, a young girl made a
life-long decision to devote her
life to the study of Tae Kwon
Do after watching her uncles
practice this ancient art in the
pre-dawn hours. Kyong-Ae, a
resident of Burlington, and the
founder of the Tae Kwon Do
Academy on College Street,
withstood the ridicule and
pressure of family and peers,
who attempted to persuade her
that martial arts were for men,
not women. “You should learn
to cook and sew for otherwise
no one would marry you.” After
her decision twenty years ago,
Kyong-Ae studied with her
uncles and later practiced alone.
When she formally enrolled in a
school, boys less skilled were
promoted to yellow, green, red,
and black belts while she
remained a white belt. There
were no belt ranks for women.
At age 14 she became a black
belt upon testing by her uncle.
Five years later she enrolled in
another school as a white belt
and was promoted step-by-step

to black belt rank. She then
came to the United States
following her marriage to an
American government worker.

Kyong-Ae now teaches Tae
Kwon Do at her Academy with
the help of her brother, also a
master instructor. She is the
Chairperson of the Women’s
Amateur Athletic Union Tae
Kwon Do subcommittee and
Chairperson of the New England
district AAU-Tae Kwon Do
committee. In March, 1978, the
Kyong-Ae Academy hosted the
New England Regional
Championships. Her students
then participated in the AAU
National Championships in
Washington, D.C., where one of
her women students took a
second place silver medal.

Certainly in recent years, the
world has changed its attitude
toward women in the martial
arts. And Kyong-Ae is one of the
women who changed it!

In September, 1977, the Tae
Kwon Do World Championships
were held in Chicago with 50
countries represented — but no
women! At that time a vision
came to Kyong-Ae, a vision of
women participating in martial
arts tournaments. In October of
that same year, following her
election as President of the
Women’s Division at the 90th
Amateur Athletic Union
convention, Kyong-Ae shared
her dream and began to persuade
the AAU Tae Kwon Do
committee (all men) to support
women in world competition.
Using the parable of the
Chopping Tree and just chipping
a little away at a time, Kyong-Ae
pursued her task until May
1978, when the committee
agreed to open the Pre-World
Tournament in Seoul, Korea, to
women. She was told, however,
that she had to raise the funds
and make all the arrangements
for the women’s team. (The
men’s team was sponsored with
funds from AAU and the Tae

Kwon Do Association). In just
four weeks with the help of
other women, $15,000 was
raised to take the team to Seoul.

Women from only four
countries were represented:
China, Lesotho, Korea, and the
United States. Eight young
women from this country
competed, including 15-year-old
Laureen McCrorey of Charlotte,
Vermont, who placed second in
the heavyweight class. In fact,
the U.S.A. women’s team won a
gold medal, four silver medals,
and three bronze medals, a
proud showing for any group.
Kyong-Ae expressed some
disappointment in the team,
however, stating, “They did not
understand how important this
competition was for women.
They did not truly appreciate
the fact that women were
competing for the first time in
4000 years of martial arts
tournaments.”

The “fight” is just beginning
as the committee for the 1st Pan
American Games in Mexico, to
be held last month, turned down
a request for women’s
representation. And women
were denied entrance for Judo in
the 1980 Olympics. Kyong-Ae is
at the forefront of this battle.
She says, “We are fighting years
of habit. Women are not used to
desiring and fighting for what
they want. We need to put
twenty times the energy of men
into our dreams in order to see
them realized.”

However, the desire for
success in the venture is strong
and the victory will be achieved
as women like Kyong-Ae attack
the system of patriarchy in one
more arena. She believes that a
seed has been planted for
women to grow. It was first hard
to find the land and now we
need to care for our planting, to
make it strong and good. Men
are not going to say, “Here let us
help you plant your seed.” No,
it is up to us to conceive the
idea, to plant it, and to nurture
it to full growth.
