SO WHEN DO YOU
.. MASTURBATE,
LOUISE?

as told to Lynn
I masturbate when I'm frustrated. Absolutely. It’s a release.
I masturbate when I do estimates (I'm a carpenter); I used to mas-
turbate in college, in the lecture hall, in my CHAIR! I mastur-
bate when I'm driving the car and I'm stuck in traffic or if I have
a long way to go and I'm thinking over my day... it’s a lot easier

in an automatic, let me tell you.

When I was a kid I used to be able to come by touching my
belly-button.

I go through periods when I masturbate every day, maybe
four times a day.

And I masturbate when I need to go to sleep and I’m not
that tired. After about four times, I can go to sleep. (four orgasms

I can orgasm a lot in a row)

I never do foreplay — it doesn’t turn me on when I’m by
myself.

And I always do it the same way: on my stomach, with the
thumb side of my hand.

Yes, I do touch myself when I’m making love with my lover,
too. I like to orgasm many times, and it happens easily for me.
And I like to come while I’m licking her.

Don’t Want to Touch

I don't want to touch you,
You don’t want to touch me.
I don't want to touch you,
You don’t want to touch me.
So what the hell are we fighting for?

Sex In The 80’s
What the hell are we fighting for?

It seems to me, the two of us agree

I want nothing from you and you want nothing from me.
No, I want nothing from you and you want nothing from me.

in the 1980's.

I can’t remember why or how your love I thought I needed
All I can tell you is “now” my feelings are depleted.

I can’t remember why I thought we’d get along.

I can’t remember why I’m writing you this song.

So what the hell are we fighting for?

What the hell are we fighting for?

It seems to me the two of us agree

No, I want nothing from you and you want nothing from me.

I don't want to touch you,

You don’t want to touch me,

I don’t want to touch you,

You don’t want to touch me.

So what the hell are we fighting for?

What the hell are we fighting for?

I think I see a possibility:

Maybe I want you to want to touch me,
Even though I don’t want you to touch me.
Maybe you want me to want to touch you,
Even though you don’t want me to touch you.
Even though I don’t want to touch you,
Maybe I want you to want to touch me.
Even though you don’t want to touch me,

Maybe you want me to want to touch you... Janice L. Perry A.K.A. Gal

SEX
HEALS

By Susan Linskey

Sex is a celestial activity.
“It can take you to some high
spaces. So often, after touching,
rolling, breathing and traveling
through my body and spirit, I
sing praise to life, that sexuality
is so great a part of our pleasur-
ing. Ya hooo!

No matter how broke,
fucked up, ugly or dumpy I feel,
I eventually heal by loving
myself. I take a break, rest,
relax, and pleasure my wonder-
ful self into a loving trance,
grounded again. Oh, it’s me!
Beautiful me. Sex is a grounding
part of our psyches.

Sexual communication with
another being is a soft cruising
experience of letting go —
opening up. The dance is deli-
cate and vulnerable. Our shared
experience is of spirits freed by
our shared animal simplicity.
Skin — muscles — smells —
liquids — shouts — howls —
mindless ecstasy. Yes, sexual
communication gets down —
loose. I love it... Our animal
selves interacting.

In our society we have all
been injured sexually. Our
society has invested big bucks in
capitalizing on pleasure. But sex
ain't worth shit if it ain’t free.
Capitalized sex is not sex — it is
fear, violence, domination, bore-
dom. So freedom is essential to
sex. Free exploration of our
gentle animal places.

We all need this intimacy,
this time to be free in our
personal lives. There are no
wrong ways to love, to express
and explore our sexuality. The
only rule in sex is freedom.

in Your Arms

Why must I hold him in your arms tonight?
He’s the kind of guy I used to cry

over and over and over and over.

But, but now, I'm looking for something new
Just me and you.

Why must I hold her in your arms tonight?

I know it’s really ’80’s, but it makes me crazy
When I want, only want, only want, only want you
like we used to do before we got so hip

over and over and over and over I-I-I

I’m looking for something new

Just me and you.

Why must I tell them that I love them when I really don’t
Really don’t really care what happens between the six of you?
It's true I’m through with all of your sickness and

your stupid games. It’s such a strain on me and you
Over and over and over and over I-I-I

I'm looking for something new

Ju-Ju-Ju-Ju Just me and you.
