welcomes police training, and  
Burlington High School welcomes ROTC. Vermont sponsors  
Navy maneuvers in Berlin and Northfield. Burlington has jet  
fighters. And Vermont is considered as a nuclear waste  
disposal site. The war drums beat louder as Reagan orders  
bombs, and headlines sit passively watching us as we buy our  
bread.

The $36 BILLION budget  
reductions from human services  
are being used to finance this  
military build-up. Nationally  
408,000 families will lose benefits under the Aid to Families  
with Dependent Children.  
279,000 families will lose other  
assistance. In Vermont, known  
cuts will cause 2,300 families to  
lose their ANFC, with some  
losing Medicaid. Day care bene-  
fits to working mothers will be  
reduced. Fuel aid will be cut,  
and 600 Vermont families will  
suffer cutbacks in food stamps.  
Social Security cuts loom,  
affecting senior citizens, and  
people with disabilities can ex-  
pect a 20% cutback in benefits.

These major cuts in services  
to people went into action  
October 1. October 2, Reagan  
announced a $180.3 BILLION  
increase in military spending for  
the MX missile and B1 bombers.  
This administration is preparing  
to not live, in the  
name of freedom.

Women and children are the  
most affected by these cutbacks.  
What rights we as women have  
are taken away, as our right to  
abortion is denied over and over  
again, and affirmative action  
programs dropped. Other so-  
called rights are never given to  
us. The same men who bring us  
war take away our rights to  
control our bodies, bar federal  
funds for abortion, and attempt  
to define when life begins.

The respect for life so often  
quoted by right-wing and  
Republican people contradicts  
itself in the respect shown for  
war, and the disrespect shown  
for women and the poor.

The economic slaughter is  
the same violence portrayed  
against us everywhere. Violence  
against women attempting to  
render us powerless, violence  
expecting submissiveness.

WE WILL NOT SUBMIT.

The sacrifice of our bodies,  
our children, our planet has  
ended.

uniform incident reporting sys-  
tem to be used by police when  
responding to “domestic distur-  
bance” calls. With the informa-  
tion collected from the police,  
and with the data collected by  
coalition groups, and others  
from the private and public  
sectors, we will be able to more  
accurately assess the incidents of  
reported battering in Vermont.

Educational programs were  
begun with schools, teenagers  
and churches in an attempt  
through knowledge and under-  
standing to interrupt, if not  
break, the cycle of violence  
which has proven to be genera-  
tional. In-service training pro-  
grams and interagency support  
systems were developed by the  
project, coalition and social  
service providers. A brochure  
describing the legal rights of  
battered women was developed  
in conjunction with Legal Aid.

Most importantly, the pub-  
lic work and support helped  
battered women identify them-  
selves, seek out help, and  
reduced the sense of isolation  
and helplessness battered women  
feel. For a year, battering and its  
effects have been very public  
issues, with a goal of creating  
awareness as to the truth of this  
violence and breaking down  
stereotypes, myths and assump-  
tions, prompting more and bet-  
ter services to battered women  
and their families.

Due in large part to this  
work and with public recogni-  
tion of the need for ongoing  
services for battered women,  
Governor Snelling earmarked  
$20,000 to continue the Project  
Against Domestic Violence for  
another year. Approved by the  
Legislature, the second year was  
funded from July 1, 1981  
through June 30, 1982. The  
current job description calls for  
continuation of much of the  
work initiated last year, work  
still in progress. It also calls for  
strengthening of the coalition  
through continued coordination  
and direction. The commission  
has hired a new director who has  
no working knowledge of any of  
the current work or groups  
providing direct services to bat-  
tered women. Coalition mem-

bers have now been asked  
to train this new director.

The commission has further  
evidenced its insensitivity and  
lack of understanding of the  
pressing and urgent needs of  
battered women and their child-  
ren by taking one and a half  
months from the Project to hire  
an unqualified coordinator. Dur-  
ing the time it will take her to  
begin to understand the com-  
plexities of this issue, battered  
women’s lives will continue to  
be at stake.

With well-qualified candi-  
dates available, and the lives of  
women and children at stake,  
there is no time to go slow or to  
silence the cries of women just  
beginning to be heard. The  
commission owes it to the public  
to explain its motivations and  
reasonings behind such an ob-  
vious and irresponsible action. A  
public view of the job descrip-  
tion and qualifications of myself  
and the new coordinator could  
help people further understand  
the issue. If, as Jones herself  
acknowledges, I did such a  
“marvelous job,” why then was I  
not rehired? Is it because, as  
Jones has previously stated, she’s  
“tired of radical lesbians work-  
ing with battered women?”  
When I pressed her for an  
explanation for why I was not  
rehired, Jones stated “The  
commission owes you no expla-  
nation.” I suggest they DO owe  
me, and the public, an explana-  
tion.

with 50,000 published for state-  
wide distribution. In addition, I  
provided legislators with infor-  
mation and documentation on  
the incidents of battering in  
Vermont and nationwide, and  
consulted with a number of  
legislative bodies reviewing legis-  
lation affecting battered women.  
With this increased awareness  
and understanding of the needs  
of battered women, and with a  
beginning commitment on the  
part of the state and individual  
citizens, the battered women’s  
networks received over  
$150,000 in donations of money  
and in-kind services this past  
year. With well over 26,236  
women identified as at risk in  
Vermont, this is far below  
identified needs. However, it  
does indicate a start and recogni-  
tion of the issue and needs of  
battered women and their advo-  
cates.
