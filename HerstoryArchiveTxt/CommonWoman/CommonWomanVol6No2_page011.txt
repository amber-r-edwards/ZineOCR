From Canada: A Film About

Pornography

‘The sex magazines have
come about because of the
women’s liberation thing. Men
feel emasculated. The greatest
turn-on for a man is to have a
woman kneeling before him
performing fellatio, the greatest
turn-on.” — David Wells, pub-
lisher of Elite and Rustler
(Toronto).

“I don’t think you should
take this too seriously. I cer-
tainly don’t go around looking
for deep meanings in all of this.”
—Suze Randall, photographer
for Hustler.

These are just two of the
voices of the pornography indus-
try that director Bonnie Sherr
Klein includes in this 70-minute
documentary released in Canada
last fall by the National Film

Board. Dancers, strippers, the
women who work the live
peep-shows, the manager of a

Times Square sex supermarket
also talk to Klein and stripper
Linda Lee Tracey. The film

follows a tour Klein makes with

Tracey, known in Montreal as
Fonda Peters, through the red-
light districts of major cities
beginning on Montreal’s St.
Catherine Street, moving to the
seamy section of Toronto’s
Yonge Street and on to Forty-
second Street in New York City.
During the course of the tour,
Tracey evolves from a worker
who defends her trade and
criticizes the women who
marched against pornography
through Times Square in 1979
to a person deeply moved by
what she sees and the women
she talks to. Moved enough
evidently to leave her job, for
she is now working for a Mon-
treal radio station and making
appearances with the film.

Not a Love Story is not an
easy film to watch, not a film to
see for an evening of entertain-
ment. National Film Board’s
Helene Dennie tells us the Board
likes to make films that make

people think. Hopefully... the

viewer will also be made to feel.
Klein gives examples from all
forms of the industry, live and
graphic, and includes samples of
the pornographic idea in adver-
tising. We see the contradiction
of the Calvin Klein separate
billboard ads in Times Square —
one of a man standing straight
and tall, the other of a woman
on her knees with pursed lips.
We see shots of women in
chains, women gagged, women
in metal bondage collars. Women

bruised and beaten, women
tortured, “a woman bound,
gagged and hanging upside

down. For a turn-on. There are
shots of women fondling each
other, showing the distorted idea
of Lesbian sex. We see inter-

course between a black man and

a white woman, a scene which is
actually playing on racist myths.
Black men are believed to be
larger than white men; therefore
the black man is hurting the
white woman, therefore the
viewer is turned on.

Klein isn't relentless in her
exposure of these acts. She cuts
away often, interspersing talks
with interviews with well-known
theorists such as Susan Griffin,
Kate Millett, Kathy Barry,
Robin Morgan and a poetry-
reading by Margaret Atwood. In
Times Square the workers tell
her how they feel about their
jobs. Some are not too critical,
but always when pressed, reser-
vations are expressed. One tells
her, “Some girls come to hate

men. That happens a lot. They
go home, have no sexual inter-
course at all.”

The point is made by the
feminists that pornography is
not about love, about sexuality,

but about hatred, violence,
death. Millett says, “It’s so
unsexy, mixed up with the idea
that sex is evil. Why do people
need this? They never had
enough. Enough love... enough
sex... We got pornography and
what we needed was eroticism.
Eroticism is for it; pornography
is against it. In the end it is
probably creating a lot of
negative attitudes about sex.”
Robin Morgan adapts James
Baldwin's phrase about what it is
to be black and conscious in
America to women: “To be
female and conscious anywhere
on the planet is to be in a
continual state of rage.”
Women’s voices aren't the only
ones speaking against the porn
industry. Klein interviews Marc
Stevens, a former actor in S/M
films. He left the work he was
doing because it was so degra-
ding to women. Psychologist Ed
Donnerstein speaks about the
fusion of sex and aggression, and
the difference in society's atti-
tudes toward the rape of a
woman and the rape of a man.
Using James Dickey’s Deliver-
ance, he points out how a raped
man is shown to suffer pain,
humiliation, anger; “a raped
woman is shown not to feel
pain or anger, but to enjoy the
humiliation.” A member of Men
Against Male Violence in San
Francisco says, “It’s one more
way of taking our feelings away.
Continuing the impulse of a
death-oriented culture.”

The strength of Not a Love
Story is that, for the most part,
Klein lets the pornographers and
the workers speak for them-
selves. Women's groups such as
Women Against Pornography in
New York and Women Against
Violence in Pornography and
Media in San Francisco have
taken the position that if people
could get a strong enough dose
of pornography, pressure would
build to shut it down or at least
to curtail it. Klein is evidently
working on this assumption.
With the backing of the Film
Board, this exposure of the
industry will reach a wider
audience than usually possible.

There are several ideas the
film does not explore that might

have given it more punch.
Griffin examines culture’s pro-
cess of destroying the feelings
of men from infancy in her
book, Pornography and Silence.
It is unfortunate this was not
included in the interview with
her. Indeed, the interviews are
somewhat disjointed. Readers
familiar with the works of these
writers may suspect the problem
was in the editing room. An-
other idea which needs exploring
is that pornography is simply the
most blatant manifestation of an
idea of human sexuality that
permeates our society. Thus we
all find S/M images in our
bedrooms, in our own fantasy
life. We may not know what it
means to separate sex from
power, violence, or degradation.
And although accused of it
by her critics (see sidebar), Klein
avoids the difficult issue of

censorship. A touchy one to be

sure, but one that women may
have to confront. It would be
nice to believe that concern will
shut down this industry, but
hardly realistic.

Finally, Canadian women
are asking why the interviews

Startling Fascism

ENGLISH CANADIAN
CRITICS ON NOT A LOVE
STORY

The blurb in the Montreal
Gazette's Movie Roundup reads:
Not a Love Story... This is an
explicit generally intelligent
documentary on the ‘porno-
graphy’ industry. The film —
directed by the National Film
Board’s Bonnie Klein and fea-
turing an odyssey of discovery
by ex-stripper Linda Lee Tracey
— has a feminist slant but
refrains from screeching pole-
mics. (emphasis mine)

The assumption is that we
can expect a movie — or book or
work of art — with a feminist
slant to contain “screeching
polemics.” Another phrase that
is a favorite of the boys of the

English Canadian press is
“feminist rhetoric.” Bruce
Bailey, film critic for the
Gazette, wrote a favorable

review of Not a Love Story. It
appears that the editors couldn't
stand to miss an opportunity to
swipe at feminists. The headline
of the review said that the
film avoided “feminist rhetoric.”

The surprise was that the
film got a favorable review at all
in the English community.
Praised by the French press in
Quebec (and sold out for weeks
in Montreal), Not a Love Story
did not do so well in Ontario. As
Michele Landsberg of the
Toronto Star commented later,
“Toronto movie reviewers hated
Not a Love Story, the anti-porno
film... I've rarely seen such bitter

unanimity.”

For example, Jay Scott of
the prestigious Toronto Globe
and Mail wrote, Not a Love

Story is a startling work —
startling because its bourgeois
feminist fascism is so ingenuous.
Not a Love Story is a documen-
tary about pampered middle-
class filmmakers reveling in
supposed oppression... another
salvo of the strange alliance
between radical feminism and
the Moral Majority... Instead of
trying to find a psychological,
cultural or even economical
rationale, the filmmakers give us
Margaret Atwood reading poetry
and Robin Morgan bawling
(literally) about how hard it is
for her...”

There is fascism in the film,
but it isn’t feminist. Another
reversal. And supposed oppres-
sion? A woman bound and
gagged and hanging upside
down, a woman fucked 12 times
a day for voyeurs to get off on, a
woman making a living by
whispering sweet nothings in a
telephone and getting insults
back, a woman sensuously suck-
ing a gun for the viewer's arousal,
a woman on her knees in a
jeans ad, in sexual acts.
Supposed oppression? And
Robin Morgan bawling. The

ultimate offense. Tears. Feeling.
Emotion. Feminine emotion.
Because its makers are women,
emotional “bias which
emerges is predictable enough.
In that sense the film is less a
factual statement than a person-
al statement.”... Lyle Slack of
the Hamilton Spectator.

It has been a while since
they've said ‘Because its makers
are women...’ Rather, much of
what was formerly anti-woman
propaganda has taken other
disguises: pornographic bias in
the English Canadian press
needs a close examination. With
human rights commissions and
press councils offering guidelines
on sexism, the men (and
women) of the mainstream press
transfer their woman-hatred to
feminist-hatred, and slip it into
copy and headlines with no fear
of reprisals. But isn’t it the same
thing?

The facts of course are not
permitted to get in the way. As
noted in the accompanying
review, Klein does not discuss
censorship in the film and
evidently she is against it. We
nevertheless find in the reviews
comments such as “the film
supports censorship.” Evidently
the argument goes something
like this. The free publication of
pornography is proof that our
system supports freedom of
expression. To criticize the por-
nography industry is to be
against freedom of expression.
Therefore criticism of the por-
nography industry is intolerable.
Sometimes this is carried to a
bizarre conclusion, that of cen-
soring the criticism of porno-
graphy in the name of free
speech (the subject of a future
article). Sometimes the desire to
censor the criticism is expressed
