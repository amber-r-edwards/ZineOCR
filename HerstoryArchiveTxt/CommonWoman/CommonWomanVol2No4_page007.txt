FEMALE AND WHOLE - Forget the “isms”

Holism

Last month we requested  
that our readers send us articles  
on holistic health and feminism.  
The following article is in  
response to that request.

By Louise Sunfeather  
Dear Sisters,

Thank you for the oppor-  
tunity to speak from my heart  
and mind about a subject very  
important to me — the relation-  
ship of the Wholistic health  
movement and the Feminist  
movement. I have been intimate-  
ly involved with both, and have  
been thinking about the relation-  
ship between the two a great  
deal. I am excited to have this  
opportunity to share my aware-  
nesses.

First let me start by broad-  
ening the subject a bit. The  
Wholistic health movement is, as  
I see it, only one manifestation  
of a world view that has implica-  
tions in many fields, much of  
which we are just now beginning  
to realize. That world view is  
called Wholism, and it is about  
the relationship between Whol-  
ism and Feminism I wish to  
speak.

Both Wholism and Femin-  
ism are “isms,” and as such share  
the best and worst qualities of  
all “isms.” They are world views,  
complete with a vocabulary  
(jargon) that describes their  
understanding of reality; they  
are philosophies which lead to  
certain ways of living; they  
invite labels; they consider them-  
selves correct and all other  
systems as potentially suspect;  
they attract bodies of followers;  
they have leaders or spokes-  
people sounding various notes;  
they contain different factions;  
etc. “Isms” seem to be a histor-  
ical/cultural phenomenon which  
arise at a point in time when the  
planetary community or parts of  
it are ready for certain qualities  
to come into their lives; when  
groups are ready for certain  
energies to manifest and be  
integrated. “Isms” are a rallying  
point for those energies to be  
made visible and conscious, and  
for people to come together  
under a common purpose to  
take the next evolutionary step  
needed, for themselves and for  
the world community. Often, in  
this context, “isms” arise and  
define themselves in opposition  
to another “ism” that has  
outworn its usefulness. Clearly,  
then, “isms” come and go, and  
each should, I think, be under-  
stood in the context of what its  
larger purpose is.

With that in mind, then,  
I would like to speak of the  
essence of both Feminism and  
Wholism, the similarities and  
differences I see in the statement  
of reality that each makes, and  
the ramifications of the relation-  
ship between the two in our  
lives.

Briefly, Feminism as a  
world view is a political philoso-  
phy, or one which describes the  
relationships of human systems  
at all levels of organization in  
terms of male/female form and  
energy. Essentially, my under-  
standing of Feminism is that it  
sees the world community as  
structured primarily on belief  
systems, values, attitudes and  
social forms that oppress women  
and exalt men, and that out of  
this grow multiple forms of  
oppression. The work of Femin-  
ism, then, becomes a political  
one of raising not only the  

consciousness but also the activi-  
ties of people so that Female  
energy may be reclaimed in its  
wholeness and full expression of  
its true power, and integrated  
into sensible forms of social  
organization. The opposition  
system to Feminism is Patriar-  
chy, which strives to elevate  
male energy and ignore and  
repress Female energy.

Wholism as a world view, on  
the other hand, is not a political  
philosophy as such, but rather a  
metaphysical system which  
looks to explain energy patterns  
in the Universe, whether com-  
bined in physical, human, spirit-  
ual, conceptual or any other  
systems. Wholism sees the Uni-  
verse composed of energy in  
constant motion, patterned into  
a telescoping system of Wholes,  
all of which are evolving toward  
their fullest possible expression.  
Each system of Whole is more  
than the sum of its parts; it is an  
entity in integration of the  
relationship of its parts to each  
other, to the Whole entity, and  
to its environment. In human  
terms this means that each  
individual, each grouping, large  
or small, each community and  
nation are both parts and  
Wholes, whole in themselves, an  
integration of their many as-  
pects, and yet parts of a still  
larger Whole. And so, whether  
the focus is on the individual in  
health care, integrating and  
bringing into balance body/mind  
and spirit, or on the planetary  
community bringing into bal-  
ance our relationship with each  
other and the earth, the issue  
from a Wholistic stance is about  
moving toward the fullest ex-  
pression of Wholeness.

The opposition system to  
Wholism is Reductionism (the  
world view underlying the be-  
havior of the Patriarchy). This  
view sees the Universe as separ-  
ate particles of matter, which  
can be best known and con-  
trolled if separated. Since all  
behavior is based on the under-  
lying world view, we can under-  
stand the development of an  
awesome technology built on  
Reductionist principles, with the  
concomitant development of a  
society of human systems full of  
isolation, fragmentation, aliena-  
tion, hate and fear. When we  
know only our separateness we  
measure and fight, one against  
the other; we hoard, rape and  
compete. When we know our  
oneness we support and accept,  
each and all; we share, respect  
and cooperate.

What, then, are the similari-  
ties and differences between  
Wholism and Feminism, and  
what is their relationship in the  
cosmic dance? The first major  
similarity that strikes me is that  
both systems are based on a  
principle of liberation, or the  
freeing up of vital resources that,  
in their repression, keep both  
the individual and the group  
from becoming all that it can be.  
In that sense, both are empower-  
ing systems, which say essential-  
ly we need not give our power to  
others but can claim our full  
power from within, power being  
defined as the ability to create  
and utilize resources to generate  
more resources. What that means  
in the Women’s community can  
be the whole range of events and  
activities (so nicely chronicled in  
Peggy and Carol’s article last  
issue!) where individuals and  
groups of women stand up and  
say, “We are for real; take us  
seriously.” My Sister’s Place, the  

Vt. Women’s Health Center and  
the whole women’s health care  
movement that it represents, the  
many consciousness-raising and  
support groups which have en-  
abled so many women to claim  
the power of their true selves are  
some examples. In the Wholistic  
movement this concept is called  
self-responsibility, and is based  
on an awareness that we are not  
only able to respond to our  
environment, but in fact are able  
to create it. What that means in  
terms of health, for example, is  
that since each person is self-  
responsible, she can create and  
participate in her own health  
and healing processes, utilizing  
the powers innate in all of her;  
her imagination, her intuition,  
her body awarenesses, her will,  
her love, her thoughts, her  
feelings, etc., all moving toward  
a balance of the Whole mind/  
body/spirit entity.

Other similarities: both  
“isms” are about coming toge-  
ther in community, sharing  

resources to create new resour-  
ces for the purpose of people  
living in a more balanced,  
harmonious and sensible way.  
Both are about creating; creating  
new forms to replace the old;  
creating new structures, based  
on new (well, really very old but  
forgotten) values; creating new  
lifestyles that put appropriate  
structure to the truths and  
forces we are uncovering and  
re-learning. Certainly the sense  
of unity felt within the women’s  
community is very much what  
Wholism is about. And, I would  
say that Feminism and Wholism  
share a similar deep spiritual  
core. To truly liberate Female  
energy is to get at the essence of  
woman, which is the power to  
create and to nurture. Women  
know our connection with  
Mother; with our biological  
mothers, with our mothering of  
our children, with the rhythms  
and tides and powers of Mother  
Earth. The spiritual core of  
Wholism is an understanding of  
that Oneness which ultimately  
transcends male or female; a  
Oneness which sees the spirit in  
all its manifestations as an  
integral part of all existence, and  
therefore to be expressed and  
developed as part of our evolu-  
tion. Both communities know  
the importance of developing  
and maintaining rituals, cere-  
monies and other appropriate  
means of expressing that impor-  
tant part of us.

Finally, the goals of both  
Feminism and Wholism ultimate-  
ly lead to the changing of every  
level of societal organization;  
touch every part of our lives,  
from birth through education,  
work, propagation of the spe-  
cies, community life, to death.

So many similarities! What  
then are the differences? One  
has already been mentioned, and  
that is the scope of these two  
world views. Feminism is based  
on an understanding of male/  
female energies in human sys-  
tems; Wholism is based on an  
understanding of all energies in  
all systems, with implications for  
human and social systems being,  
obviously, a main focus. That  
turns out to be an important  
distinction, for in reacting  
against men, Feminist women  
run the risk of falling into the  
Reductionist trap of experienc-  
ing the world of we/them  
instead of Us. Wholistic vision  
looks to the Wholing of all  
peoples, to the coming together  
in recognition of our Oneness  

across the artificial lines of  
distinction we have traditionally  
used to separate us, whether  
those lines be about gender,  
religion, color, economic status,  
belief system, nationality or  
whatever. This does not mean,  
by the way, that everybody is  
the same! Each individual, each  
grouping is a unique expression  
of the life force, and that  
uniqueness is to be cherished.  
But each is a unique expression  
of the same life force; we share  
the same essence and ultimately  
our differences are illusion of  
form. Energy gets expressed in  
many modes — for example in  
the forms of mind, of body and  
of spirit, yet together they are  
one entity, and represent the  
same energy manifest at differ-  
ent rates of vibration. At a  
practical level, this difference  
shows itself in the fact that  
Feminists tend to work, play  
and associate mainly with wom-  
en; Wholistic practitioners have  
men in their lives.

Another distinction I have  
noticed is the sense still present  
in the women’s community of  
women having been victims of  
male oppression; i.e., the men  
are the enemy, we are their  
victims, and like all good victims  
we are enraged at them for  
keeping us down. In my first  
exposure to the Wholistic world  
view, through the process of my  
own healing from breast cancer,  
I learned very quickly the false  
seduction of the victim stance. It  
was easier to assume I was a  
helpless victim of cancer and to  
be furious at the doctors for  
cutting me up than to accept the  
fact that we create our own  
reality. That is what self-respon-  
sibility is all about. The cancer  
was a symptom or signal of my  
unbalanced living. So too is  
sexism a symbol of the unbalan-  
ced energy of our human sys-  
tems. But to assume the symbol  
is the enemy is, I think, to miss  
the point. In having participated  
in the disharmony of my own  
unbalance I helped create the  
symptom; I am no victim of it.  
In my healing I chose not to  
focus on fighting the cancer, but  
on claiming the true harmony  
inherent in my being. So, too, in  
our having participated in the  
disharmony of our culture we  
have all contributed to it, and to  
its effects on our lives and the  
lives of others. That doesn’t  
mean we are “bad.” One of the  
primary confusions about Whol-  

istic health is the assumption  
that self-responsibility is the  
same as blame; that I am “bad”  
if I am dis-eased; it is somehow  
my fault, with a negative judg-  

ment attached. But responsibi-  

lity doesn’t need to mean blame  
— that is part of the Reduction-  
ist trap that says fragments can  
be separated from and measured  
against each other, and that one  
part is to blame for what  
happens in another. But if all  
parts of the whole exist in  
relationship to each other then  
responsibility lies within all  
components. All I need to do is  
invoke my will to change my  

participation in unbalanced  
living. I can make conscious  
choices, through increased  

awareness, about every aspect of  
how I live. That is, of course, a  
great challenge. But then, all  
pioneers thrive on challenge, and  
those who get tired drop by the  
way.  
What, then, about the  
anger? Of course I was angry at  
my cancer, and at the “establish-  
ment” for the way they treated  
me. Of course we feel angry at  
our oppression, even if we have  
colluded with it. What's impor-  
tant about anger is that it be  
expressed and let go of, like any  
other feeling. In a Wholistic  
awareness of energy we see that  
our thoughts, feelings, desires  
and other intangible experiences  
are powerful creators. Whatever  
we give focused energy to  
becomes bigger and stronger.  
That’s the principle of escala-  
tion, whether it be in Vietnam  
or between Right-to-Lifers and  
Abortion advocates. That's also  
the principle of visualization and  
affirmation, key techniques in  
Wholistic healing. Whatever we  
give energy to becomes real.  
Anger or hate held on to merely  
gives increased vitality to its very  
target. The power of Wholing  
(healing) is in the transformation  
of energy; the transformation of  
blocked energy into freely flow-  
ing energy; the transformation  
of hate into love, fear into  
courage, sickness into health,  
negativity into positivity, mon-  
sters into friends, anger into  
caring. When energy is blocked  
anywhere in the system the  
system is unable to move its  
next step in evolution; it is  
stuck. Frequently I have exper-  
ienced that blocked energy in  
the women’s community, and it  
has made me very sad.
