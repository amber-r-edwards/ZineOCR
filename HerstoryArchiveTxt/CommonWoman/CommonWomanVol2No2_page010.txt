matriarchy

To discuss this, Daly creates  
and redefines words. She is a  
poet-essayist here. And she de-  
mands us to be poets as well. As  

poets we will enter the “Other  
world.” The world  
women have occupied in patriar  

chy, women will enter with new  
eyes. It will no longer be @  
distasteful and evil exile from  
the mainstream of society, but  
an energizing/gynergizing exper-  

ience.

The Otherworld is the cave,  
the open sea, the vagina. The  
monsters of the old patriarchy  
will rise up and literally kiss us  
in our dreams. The monsters are  
each one of us. Women are the  
only monsters in patriarchy. In  
the Hagocracy the monsters rise  
out of the sea, which is the  
greatest fear of patriarchy, and  
exorcise the Universe of the  

extreme patriarchal woman-  
hating society. The monsters will  

knock down/up the facades of  
the great patriarchal ego — god  
the father. Patriarchal authority  
will be more than questioned, it  

will be smashed!

With one great stroke the  
monsters will show us as poets  
what we have known all along —  

that the monster in all of us will  
energize/gynergize the world.

Does it all seem so strange?  

So unreal? Daly captures our  

creativity in this women-loving  
work. She has struggled to find  
connection with women and has  
struggled to express it. As she  
states in her introduction, at  

times the work is like poetry.

And as Adrienne Rich writes  
in her latest book of poems, The  

Dream of a Common Language,  
“a whole new poetry is begin-  
ning — here.” Further, Daly  
describes Hags; the daughters of  
matriarchy, as  
struggling to see connection. Hags  
risk a great deal — if necessary,  
everything — knowing that there  
“is only nothing to lose.”

Nothing to lose and Everything  
to gain. The Everything is  

the connection with women.  
The Nothing is  
patriarchy has given to women —  
nothing. Women, even in the  
“most mate-identified cliques  
such as women’s colleges and  
sororities, have found those  
moments of total woman energy  
and total connection. That is  
Everything. That is why women  
connect.

Gyn/Ecology is  
intensely woman-loving. It is  
intensely threatening and freeing  
at the same time. Mary Daly's  
proposals are the culmination of  
the painful consciousness raising  
and exorcism that many femin-  
ists have gone through. Daly  
Hagocracy = a

matriarchy of new women  
deeply rooted in the herstory of

Atos 2  

In my own experience at a  
women’s college, those times  
haunt me now. When men  
entered the scene the energy  
level was split. That split is  
your best friend getting married.  

You are angry in a deep sense  
because you have been ultimate-  
ly betrayed. A friend did not tell  
me she was getting married on  
two separate occasions and  
backed out at the last minute on  
both of them. I wonder now  
how she hurt me.

It is the atrocity of splitting  
women against themselves which  
Daly analyzes closely. Her analy-  
sis is devastating — going from  
culture to culture. These atroci-  
ties, African genital mutilation,  
the Indian sutee, Chinese foot-  
bindings, European witch-  
burning, American gynecology,  
and Nazi medicine, are commit-  
ted in a repeating seven-step  
pattern.

The steps begin with an  
obsession with purity. Women  
are the impurity of patriarchy  
and must be punished for that  
impurity according to the cock-  
eyed logic of the patriarchal  
Sao-Ritual. With the messy  
menstruation (physical impur-  
ity) and their slimy irrationality  
(spiritual impurity) women must  
be killed, maimed and made  
over.

The analysis ends with the  
modern-day scholar who thinks  
he is being objective. Scholars  
legitimize the atrocities through  
their “research” by which the  
atrocities are isolated and mis-  
named. This “research” becomes  
like a ritual. Through his “re-  
search” the scholar finds satis-  
faction in his discovery of the  
atrocity. He relives the atrocity  
because it is ‘an extension of  
the primordial gynocidal act.’  
In his “Re-search” once again he  
kills matriarchy through his  
objectivity.

We may wonder why Daly  
spends so much time dwelling on  
these atrocities and needs to  
analyze them so avidly. We may  
ask why dwell on what is already  
known by many feminists? Why  
spend so much time on what is  
wrong in the deepest sense of  
the word?

In a footnote Daly cues us  
into this process of exorcism.  
She cites a communication from  
Adrienne Rich: “Ordinarily one  
would associate the search for  
knowledge with eagerness, curio-  
sity, the thirst to know. But for  
us, much of what we have to  
learn is depressing at least,  
sickening at worst. The desire  
for knowledge of our condition  
and in particular of gynocide  
and the enemy status to which  
we are relegated is in direct  
conflict with the burden of  
horror and revulsion which that  
knowledge imposes on us... In  
the pre-exorcistic state of terror  
of what one knows, one is going  
to have to paralyze the Searcher.  
And there is the sense that once  
one has uncovered it — ‘After

Games Mother Never Taught

“Edna is a cum laude Harvard  
graduate who entered the  
management training program of  
a major bank, along with nine  
men. In the second year of the  

program she found herself  
settled into a branch office  
handling personal checking  

accounts while the men were  
located in various sections of the  
commercial operations and had  
progressed several notches above  
her in status and salary. When  
she complained about being  

sidetracked, she was told there  
were two different training  
programs and since she hadn't  

specified either she was  
naturally relegated to the  
division where her ability to get  
along with female customers  
would be most useful.”

A clear-cut example of  
sexism? Absolutely. But could  
this particular consequence have  
been avoided? YES, says Ms.  
Harragan, if Edna, a competent,  
ambitious woman, had had an  
elementary conceptual  
knowledge of the working  
environment! This example, and  

many others, illustrate Ms.  
Harragan’s premise that  
“working” is a game women  

never learned to play.” This lack  
of knowledge is the reason why  
many women, whether working  
to make ends meet or for a  
career, have been confused and  
unsure about how and why  
things happen as they do in  
business.

Not only a “how to” manual  
for success in business, Games is  
a brilliant feminist analysis of  
how the socialization process  
steers women away from the  
skills and attitudes that are  
necessary to understanding the  
world of work, and how that  
socialization into housewives,

mommies or temporary workers  
— just until marriage — leaves us  
without the needed perspective  
to realize how the game of  
“working” is played. Ms.  
Harragan remedies that, with a  
clearly written, witty and often  
sarcastic expose of “the game,  
the board and the rules” of  
working for pay — how  
corporations work and how to  
read the status symbols; goals —  
how to set them and how to  
attain them; and a tremendously  
useful chapter on how to handle  
difficult situations — asking for a  
raise, the consequence of sexual  
relationships with your  
co-workers or your boss, and  
how to handle the promotion  
you earned.

But what if you've been  
working for a while, or have  
never really allowed yourself to  
consider work seriously? Isn’t it  
too late? On the contrary, says  
Ms. Harragan. Just because  
women are newcomers to the  
game doesn't mean that we  
should count ourselves out!

“For the seriously ambitious  
woman there is only one logical  
objective: to become the chief  
executive officer of the  
corporation... To aim for  
anything less is to short-change  
yourself at the outset and to cut  
off your potential before you  
have any way of knowing what  
it is. Inasmuch as women as a  
class have no criteria to evaluate  
their business futures, and male  
management has no divining rod  
to unearth female potentialities,  
there is no way to predict the  
outcome of the game until  
women join the corporate teams  
with the express intention of  
becoming captain. Prior to this  
second half of the seventh  
decade of the twentieth century  
such a suggestion would have  
been foolish and frivolous; from  
now on, any lesser ambition is  
female folly.”

And so with Daly  
and the many other radical feminists,  
we trudge through the dead  
manure piles of patriarchy only  
to uncover atrocity after atrocity. In the towering necrophilia  
it seems we might be over-  
whelmed, but it is the anger  
which lets loose a new creative  
space instead of dispersing into  
what we have known in patriar-  
chy — women fighting women.

The split between women is  
so pervasive that even Daly at  
times attacks such things as  
feminist therapy. Perhaps her  
point is well taken. Feminist  
therapy can be an uncreatively  
disguised form of the taming/  
maiming of women. Who would  
think a “feminist” would make  
it her life to calm down women  
of our hysteria, our “obsessive”  
craziness in which we find our  
true Self and the Ecology of the  
Self — the Gyn/Ecology.

The mire of atrocities seems  
to work like a compost pile  
nevertheless. In Gyn/Ecology, as  
in other radical feminist works,  
we find the beautiful flower  
rising out — the flower of

We are too concerned with our  
beers’ competitive pressure to  
take the time and patience that  
younger people need in order  
to grow and to become more  
independent. As age barriers  
diminish, so does competition.  
What 20-year-old person is going  
to throw 5 bone-breaking tackles  
at a nine-year-old?

The same should hold for  
the super-athlete playing with  
the beginner. If the teams are  
unmatched, swap a few players  
or slow down the game to a level  
where we all can enjoy it, not  
just the better players. The  
result is less competition, more  
fun, and a greater understanding  
for other people and their needs.  
At half time, maybe we could all  
offer each other constructive  
criticism rather than worry  
about the score and who is  
scoring the most points. Laugh-  
ing at our mistakes rather than  
swearing at them makes the  
game all the more fun. Playing

Self Health for Lesbian Women,  
by Paula Klein and Suzanne  
Vilmain  

Reviewed by Lynn Vera  

There has been little re-  
search in the area of lesbian  
health care, and our unique  
health needs in regard to how  
and what womyn can contract  
from each other. The informa-  
tion contained in a new pamph-  
let, Self Health for Lesbian  
Women, is not voluminous, but  
the politics of lesbian health,  
and the awareness of holistic  
health, make it exciting, essen-  
tial and worthwhile reading.

The writing is not attempt-  
ing to be “nice,” or necessarily  
acceptable to the medical world;  
it is written for us. In celebra-  
tion, dedication, and anger the  
authors, Paula Klein and  
Suzanne Vilmain, take an impor-  
tant step into an area purpose-  
fully ignored by a medical world  
that assumes womyn are hetero-  
sexual. Through self-help (em-  
phasizing self-examination and  
self-knowledge) we can take  
back control of our bodies and  
our health. Self-help is an  
attempt “to seize the ‘techno-  
logy’ without buying the ideol-  
ogy."

The short, helpful explana-  
tions of various forms of vagini-  
tis, bladder infections and V.D.  
break down the mystery of  
recognizing and identifying these  
ailments, and also offer natural,  
easy ways to control or avoid  
them. The reproduction section  
includes: artificial insemination,  
a serious discussion of partheno-  
genesis and a description of  
cloning. There is also good  
information (though brief) on  
diet and exercise.

I strongly encourage all  
womyn, especially my lesbian  
sisters, to send for this pamphlet  
(25 cents each, 13 cents for 10  
or more) or call the Women’s  
Health Center to see when  
they'll have them in stock. The

Continued from Page 7 *  

Kunin listed eight rules for  
how to approach work for social  
change. Briefly: (1) Be well  
informed. (2) Keep anger under  
control. (3) Use a personal  
approach. (4) Learn when to  
quit, don't overdo it. (5) Treat  
authorities with respect. (6) Be  
sensitive to proper timing. (7)  
Have faith in the political  
process. Change is possible  
through the system. Be optimis-  
tic. (8) Welcome coalitions; they  
are more effective than an  
individual approach.  
In conclusion, Kunin urged  
us to be advocates for our cause,  
whatever it might be, from  
farming to anti-abortion. It’s not  
easy, and we may not be able to  
influence the outcome to our  
complete satisfaction. “It is
