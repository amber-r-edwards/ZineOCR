themselves to the outsides of the
leaking drums.

The Rockwell Corporation,
suppliers of a good deal of our
government's military hardware,
owns the nuclear facility at
Hanford, Washington. This site
has leaked 422,000 gallons of
radioactive liquid wastes into the
ground, which threatens to con-
taminate the Columbia River,
the major water source for the
region.

Remember Karen — Silk-
wood? Well, the same company,
Kerr-McGee, hired 100 Navajo
men to mine uranium at their
Cove, New Mexico, site. From
breathing in the radioactive
radon gases, 45 have developed
malignant cancer tumors and 25
have already died from the
cancer they received. The survi-
val rate for this type of cancer is
5%.

Kerr-McGee mines more
uranium than anyone else in the
world, and, like Mobil and
Exxon, they are doing so at the
expense of Navajo peoples
whose lands and people are
relentlessly exploited and left
contaminated by the waste pro-
ducts which are never removed
from their lands. Kerr-McGee
has left 71 acres of radioactive
nuclear wastes at one abandoned
mill site alone at Shiprock,
where the largest number of
Navajo people now live. These
wastes, which have been left
untreated and exposed to the
elements, sit 60 feet from the
San Juan River, which supplies
water for the people, livestock
and agriculture. From this site,
Kerr-McGee moved to another
area of the reservation where
they have already built the
largest uranium production mine
in the world, with two more
under construction. There are
people living in hundreds of
homes, schools and churches in
Grand Junction, Colorado, that
were accidentally built with
radioactive waste materials left
over from uranium mining.

Such “accidents” are not
the only cause for concern. In
1961, the NRC documented a

murder-suicide at the nuclear
reactor near Idaho Falls invol-
ving a plant worker who deliber-
ately pulled the control rods out
of the reactor’s core, killing and
causing the dismemberment of
himself and two other men in
the explosion. “There was a love
triangle consisting of two of the
operators and the wife of one of
the men,” explained NRC assis-
tant director Dr. Stephen Han-
duer. Machines will always be
vulnerable to sabotage, and the
people who operate the ma-
chines will always be fallible
beings.

A dependable water supply
is obviously essential to the
operation of any nuclear facility.
However, the nuclear reactor
near Palo Verde, Arizona, is
getting its water piped in from
14 miles away. This desert area
is called “the country’s first
nuclear park,” with plans to
build four more plants in the
same “park.”

In her book Nuclear Mad-
ness, Helen Caldicott tells us
about the two senior military
men who fly around continuously
over Phoenix, Arizona, in
eight-hour shifts. They each hold
a key which must be inserted
simultaneously into a technical
device to initiate nuclear war.
And then there are the two guys
on the Trident nuclear submar-
ines who have to pull levers
simultaneously to launch nu-
clear missiles. They each have a
gun to shoot the other one
should one of them go berserk.
Thirty of the men who have held
this position have been declared
emotionally unstable and dis-
missed.

It really is a madness, a sort
of massive criminal insanity.
World governments spend twice
as much on armaments as on
health care. Half of all U.S.
scientists are employed by the
military industrial complex. Mili-
tary research gets more public
funds than all social needs
combined. This year, Carter
increased the military budget
by $2.2 billion to a record high
of $124 billion, while he cut
social and domestic budgets by
$15 billion. Secretary of Energy
James Schlesinger has called for
a speedup in nuclear plant
construction.

In what must be the sale of
the century, Brazil contracted to
buy eight nuclear reactors from
West Germany for $20 billion,
or one-sixth of its entire GNP.
Brazil has sufficient hydroelec-
tric power to see it through to
the next century and nuclear
produced electricity will cost
three times more. The one plant
it has now was built by Westing-
house and it’s literally cracking
up. Also, two nuclear plants in
West Germany are similarly
falling apart, and, all things
considered, Brazil is beginning to
talk of reducing its order to six
or maybe two, but maybe more
if Argentina follows through on
its announcement to build its
own nuclear plants in the near
future. The name of this game is
“Nuclear power means the cap-
ability for manufacturing nu-
clear bombs.”

To give bomb production
some perspective, consider that
the total of all bombs exploded
in World War II equals 3.1
megatons. The total of all the
bombs dropped in Indochina
from 1965 to 1973 equals 6.5
megatons. We currently have
50,000 megatons of bombs in
the world. The U.S. has many
bombs that have a 25 megaton
capacity each. Yet we build
more bombs daily. The mistakes
have been many, the wisdom
sparse, the amount of integrity
negligible, the outright lies and
criminal neglect beyond credibi-
lity in scope, and I for one do
not sleep soundly because of it.
It is frightening to realize that
we probably only know a very
small percentage of what has
actually been done, is being
done, and is being planned for
decades to come.

By the way, did you know
that the Union of Concerned
Scientists in Cambridge, Massa-
chusetts, recommended the shut-
down of the Three Mile Island
Nuclear Facility near Harrisburg,
Pennsylvania, for safety reasons
two months before it became
the site of the worst known U.S.
commercial nuclear plant acci-
dent so far?

It is possible that at this
juncture in history, the construc-
tion of commercial nuclear
plants may cease altogether for
purely economic reasons. Ura-
nium has jumped from $8 to
$45 a pound, becoming a costly
fuel source, the cost of building
a reactor in 1980 will be 200%
of the cost of building one in
1978, poor construction and
frequent shutdowns have run up
costs into the billions, public
outcries over cost and safety are
beginning to take effect, and the
overall cost of energy output has
run 20% higher than the cost of
coal and other energy sources.
Only two orders for the con-
struction of nuclear plants have
been contracted for 1979, and
many of the ones previously
contracted have been cancelled.

The end of the construction
of new commercial nuclear
reactors would be a tremendous
victory, but in reality we must
remember that military nuclear
plants are much larger and much
more dangerous to us all and will
not even be affected by such a
victory. In the end, it is not
the nuclear plants that threaten
to extinguish our lives, but the
mentality of the people who
profit from nuclear power, and
who value profit over life every
time. When it comes down to
the current reality of the nature
of men and their pursuit of
power and profits, rape energy
will often run even out of their
own control.

Perhaps nuclear examples
are the most potentially devasta-
ting we have to date. However,
such corrupted mentality and
criminally immoral actions are
the inevitable and repeated
demonstrated conclusions of
man’s worldwide corporate
greed and his insane and unend-
ing quest for “death-defying”
powers that ensure increasing
devastation. If the planet and all
life on it is to survive, this rapist
in all his forms will have to
be subdued.
