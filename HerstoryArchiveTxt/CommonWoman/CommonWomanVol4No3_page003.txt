Dear Commonwoman,

Just received the March/
April issue of Commonwoman.
As always, I steal away either

© mentally and/or physically to
read you immediately! The
transcript of the conversation
“Reaching Out” spoke to me
and your request for a response
prompted this letter.

I'm a feminist, married,
mother, career person, lover,
person... all these things rolled
into me. I feel the need to
identify my ingredients of self
because it is always such an issue
with Commonwoman. (I wish it
wasn’t an issue, I wish it was
- because I just wanted you to
know about me, I wish I could
just say... “I am a woman!”)

COMMONWOMAN MAY, 1981

LETTERS

Speaks To All Women

The articles in Common-
woman speak to all women. The
word lesbian does not turn me
off. I try to relate to the articles
as female issues. I feel in my
soul, the instinctive woman, that
“the mountain-moving day is
coming... all sleeping women
now will awake and move”
(Yosano Akiko). I know all
women feel this, some of us just
don't admit it. We know the
reality of our female struggles
and dreams.

Sometimes I feel Common-
woman does not want to expand
into issues that deal with straight
women because it involves

“straight women.” I don’t want
to read about “men,” but they
are part of my life, and I don’t

I swear it to you
I swear it on my common woman's head

The common woman is as common as a common loaf of bread —

and will rise!

want to be alienated because of
this.

I will continue to support
Commonwoman by subscription,
and when speaking with
other women like myself I'll
positively push it! Just as long as
Commonwoman speaks to all
women, however thread-like.

And for just plain reasons
of... I’m afraid to sign my name

A Friend

Keep
Impact

Dear Sisters,

As a lesbian, and a feminist
in a barren, lonely place for
lesbian feminists, I find your
paper a welcome publication
where I find validation and
support for my political and
personal views. I hope you do
not lose any of your impact by
trying to appeal to the straight,
conventional population. In a
time when the national trend
swings dangerously

I was in Burlington for the
Holly Near concert and after-
wards participated in the march
protesting the disgusting rapes
occurring at UVM. I was startled
and disappointed to find that
men were allowed to participate.
Far too much precious energy
was lost in dealing with the
brothers of the rapists, and I left
the action feeling frustrated and
drained. It was bad enough to
have to sit with them through
the concert; marching with them
in a womyn’s protest was
unbearable...

In revolution,

Kirstina Elke

Broader
Scope
To the Editorial Staff:

Here is a small contribution
in hopes that Commonwoman
will survive by broadening its
scope and outreach to serve,
educate and express the needs
and dreams of all women. I
believe this is the only hope for
survival of your paper, the
women’s movement and our
endangered planet. To this end
you may have to decide on
certain standards and quotas to
ensure a balanced paper. It could
only help.

With much concern,
Karen Carmichael

Exciting

Hello, Commonwomen,

Thought I would just let
you all know how important
your paper is to me. It’s challeng-
ing and exciting and I learn
something new every issue...
Energy to all you good womyn.

“Atrocities”

Important

I have been receiving your
publication for the last two
years because one of my closest
friends worked on it and would
have it sent to me.

I have enjoyed it immensely
— even the articles that unsettled
me. Especially appreciated is the
column ATROCITIES — it is
very important to keep from
falling into the general unreality
that “those things only happen
to others, some place else.”

Men
As Allies

Dear Sisters,

I went to a Liberation
Workshop a couple of weeks ago
that opened horizons of hope
and excitement; we are all
human beings. This may sound
apparent, but it is something we
forget. Allies work with their
oppressors towards oppression.

The work was done with Jews and non-Jews, Lesbian and non-Lesbian,

Young People and Adults,
Women and Men, etc., and the
element that ran through all
groups was the fear that grips
onto our oppression so desper-
ately tends to keep us divided
from other oppressed people and
all human beings.

Sexism is a painful and
anger-packed issue. We have
hurts that need to be heard and
we must continue to do this by
seeking the safety of our com-
munities and friends, but we
must start seeing men as humans
that can be reached out to and
united with us in our struggle as
humans. We need to offer our
oppression to men and have it
accepted as the object to be
dissolved by us together. Until
this happens, sexism will not
move.

Anger does not move op-
pressors; understanding and
lovingness as humans will. Why
women? Because we can see
clearly the oppression and have
the strength and cause to recog-
nize men as human beings and
not the enemy. Men have the
responsibility to continue to
look for and gain support from
other men; our responsibility is
to give them the understanding
and love that they need to look
at the fear of feelings, social
conditioning, and hurt they feel
from having hurt others.

Look past the “Male”
behavior that is a front for
insecurity, fear, guilt, jealousy,
and see the human that’s yelling
and yearning for the love and
validation that all humans need
and deserve. Men tend to react
intellectually when hurt. We can
start building an alliance on the
human level. This is the point
to push men and

start them moving on sexism.
Yes, the “male” behavior that is
so hurtful to us as women must
be interrupted and we must keep
our pride, but interrupt and be
proud lovingly and courageous-
ly. We must take a step, too.
We're in this one together.

In strength,

Eve Berman
