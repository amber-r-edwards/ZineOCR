SEX - - -- Bugging O

The next issue of Common-
womon will hopefully be an
issue on SEX, if we can solicit
enough material from womyn on

the subject. In an attempt
at being provocative, the editors
of Commonwomon gathered

together at one of our apart-
ments to discuss the topic. The
following statements have been
excerpted from the tape made at
that time. If you see anything
that compels you to write,
please send us your articles. If
this has not been a successful
catalyst for you to overcome
your writing block, and you
remain uninspired, please send
us something to inspire us. Our
next copy deadline is January

— Sex is a lot like eating.
Eating is good for your body. It
smells good, it tastes good and it
has texture. In a way I wish I
didn’t eat with anyone I didn’t
like either.

— Erotic energy is part of
my life every day.

— I feel that making love to
myself is as much “making love”
as making love to someone else.

— I would like to feel that
way. When there’s another per-
son it's a different thing. Mastur-
bation... for me sometimes it
does mean less. When it’s a
substitute it does seem less.
Sometimes it’s choice.

— You can masturbate for
different reasons... if you're in a

— DUN. Maine need to be some re.
and it’s like a sneeze. Or you

do something different.
(THE SUBJECT CHANGES TO
CASUAL SEX)

— Is it necessary that sex be
“holy?” Is that cultural? Does it
feed into the nuclear family and
marriage?

— But is it casual? It should
be honorable somehow. They
say they’re having casual sex.
But, they don’t treat it casually.
I’m not sure that casual is the
right word for that option of
sexuality.

— Why is love-making sup-
posed to define the relationship,
make it into a recognizable
thing?

— It all starts with being
uptight about our bodies...

(WE COME TO TALK ABOUT
PORNOGRAPHY)

— Pornography is a warping

of sensual erotic energy. It’s like

~*~ junk food, I used to get really

excited about Snicker’s bars. I
have a different attitude now.
— Who decides what is por-

nographic?

— Pornography is a feeling
less.

— So... what does it mean

when I get turned on by what is
sold as pornography?

— It’s like a numbing of
certain kinds of feelings of your
heart.

— To me the pictures are
numbing because I feel like I’m
the woman in the photograph.

— When you start taking care
of yourself, you feel different.
It’s the same with sexuality.
There’s different kinds of sexual
energy. For me, because of being
raped and beaten as a kid, I see
an S/M picture and I feel a
sexual energy around it. It’s not

that I feel erotic. I just associate
sexual energy with that kind of
thing, because that’s what hap-
pened to me when I was a kid...
it doesn’t feel erotic, but there’s

something definitely sexual
about it... on some level I
associate sexual energy with

those kinds of images.
— There are different cate-
gories... there’s sexual passion

and compassion and my passion.

— Pornography is the censor-
ship... some women dress them-
selves to be accepted... you have
to get numb... we don’t let it
drive us crazy like it should. You
can't feel angry every minute of
your life. You block it up.

— It’s confusing. I may move
a certain way. I think about it. I
ask myself: where does this way
of moving come from? Does it
come from the movies? Am I
mimicking them, or are they
mimicking me?

— The only antidote is for
our erotic energy to be liberated.
What is sensual and what is sex?
What is a comfortable way of
being?

— There are people I’m
turned on around, but I sure as
hell don’t want to make love to
them.

— Sex

doesn’t happen as

easily for me as dancing with

someone, or sitting and talking

to someone.
— Sometimes I

feel like I stay in a monogamous situation
because it’s easier — because that
part of my life is taken care of,

— Time is an issue. You have
to be at work, you have to sleep.
If our lives could flow with time
easier, they could flow with sex
easier.

— Why does it seem that
relationships evolve around sex?
No relationship begins to include
sex without changing the nature
of that relationship.

— Friendships can be erotic
without ever going to bed.

— I don’t have any close
friends I haven't been sexual
with.

— Why would you want to
be sexual with someone if they
weren't capable of being a
friend?

— Where do you make the
distinction between your friend
and your lover? Why do we get
turned on to people that we

might not really like that much?

— Too many times the rela-
tionship follows the sex. Then
down the road a ways, I don’t
like the person.

And you can't just say,
I'm turned on by this person...
because how does she feel?

— I always have stronger erotic
feelings about my friends. It’s
just erotic to me. Maybe you'll
get into making love, maybe not.

— When I thought I was
straight and I had highly erotic
feelings about my friends, I
didn’t have the head space to
call that sexual. I never felt
potentially sexual about every
man I knew. It didn’t happen
that way.

— One of the biggest ingrained
head-sets about sexuality, not
that any of us plays into it any
more (HA!!!), is that it’s gonna
happen with this one special
magnificent person and it’s
gonna last FOREVER. That's
why we become afraid of being
sexual with our friends...
because friendships come and
go... we've registered that... and
it’s more dramatic somehow if
the sexuality comes and goes,
because it was SUPPOSED to
last forever.

— In sexual relationships,
you sometimes end up saying

“0.” Who wants to do that to a
friend?

— I feel like I want to be
friends with my lovers and lovers
with my friends,

(EVERYONE IS TALKING AT
ONCE)

— Things change, goddamn
it. We've all been in tears over it.
‘What did I do wrong?” ‘

— The thing is... when you
do start being sexual, you do it
and you do it and you DO IT
and you play it to the max. And
you're setting it up for tragedy
because you play it to the max.
And it can’t stay at that peak
level. So, why expect it to?

— Should you save it for
dessert, or go for it, for as long

as it lasts?
— I don't think it’s bad that
it’s hard to adjust to a change in

intimacy. I have a hard time
when that happens with a friend.
Why act like you shouldn’t be
upset at a loss of intimacy?
— Falling in love. It can
happen with a book. When you

lose the focus on yourself, it’s
conscious work to get energy
from this person and carry it
into your life, rather than give
everything else up because
you've “fallen in love.”

— A discussion of sexuality
totally disintegrates constantly
into one about relationships.

— We keep trying to make
categories. We/You/Separate.
That keeps the intimacy, the
passion, out of it. It should just
move,

— Being a lesbian, every
closeness brings up the potential
of sexuality.

— I started being a feminist
when I started being sexual.

— How can we liberate our
erotic energy in this culture?

— For me the playful or
imaginative is easier when I’m
with myself.

— It takes confidence to

play. You have to be confident
to touch her right. This is an
issue with someone else.

— It’s her responsibility to
get what she needs. To ask for
yourself is scarier, I’m not used
to asking for things.

— It’s harder to ask than to
do what someone else wants. If
both people are asking, it’s great.
It’s expansive that way. The
more you ask for what you want
and get it, the more you'll know
what you want and the more

you want.

— That sounds like voracious
sexuality.

— Passion means letting

loose, becoming someone else.
— Passion is heightened.
— Do we ideally want sex to
be more “heightened” or more
“normal?”

— In love, it takes work not to

ourselves

— Both.

— It could be more and also
less of a preoccupation.

— If we were more playful in
general, everything would work
better.

— As you heal the mind-
body split, you become more
psychic.

— I lived with this psychic
woman once who said she was
going to have a baby by partheno-
genesis, and I thought she was
going to do it.

— Let’s talk about Fantasy.

— Sex is the most fun when
I can’t tell if it’s her clit or mine.

— I think about mud sometimes.

— I saw a horse running
once, and I became totally
impassioned.

— Creamed your jeans, right?

— I can get so turned on
sometimes when I’m hanging out
with my dog. And I’m not even
thinking about sex, about being
turned on. Rushes, rushes, I get
turned on. (You can print this,
but don’t put my name on it.)

— People don’t talk about it
much. Bestiality.

(SILENCE HERE)

— Having sex is safe when
you do it to procreate. Hetero
sex and having kids became
synonymous... and that’s why
people couldn’t understand that
lesbians really like to have sex
with each other.

— In more sexually permis-
sive eras there has always been

more lesbianism.

— The outdoors, the ocean,
the sun, the wind, any of these
can be highly erotic and that’s
when sexuality gets to take over,
not expectations of being with
someone. Total, freefloating,

— In the beginning there
isn’t an object, a man, woman
force; when you become sexual,
it’s your body. It isn’t anything
else. All that happens after-
wards,

— With some experiences, in
nature, alone, you feel like
you're having an orgasm anyway
and you’re not doing anything
but just being there.

— So, something different
happens when it's translated into
two people,

(THE SUBJECT CHANGES TO
RAPE)

— This is a possibility
every one of our lives.

— I would kill next time.
The only reason why it hap-
pened is because I didn’t kill
him. That was not allowed in my
mind. I would have to hurt him.
— I would have had to do
something very serious to him,
and I wouldn't let myself do
that. And now I would. No
question. And I wish we could
all feel that.

— Killing someone is no
worse than that person violating
me. They are killing part of me.
There is no contradiction be-
tween non-violence and that.

— Women get put in prison.
Of course, there are reasons why
women aren't doing this but we
have to be deconditioned.

— And... reporting it. It’s the
same process again, for a year
afterwards, it’s going from the
boys to the boys.
