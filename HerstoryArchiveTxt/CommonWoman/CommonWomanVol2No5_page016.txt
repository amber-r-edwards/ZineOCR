so take your GOD DAM  

put downs  
and lie them down  
down  
down.

“Shrew  

Continued from Page 14  

Melzer knows her Shake-  
speare. This was the best produc-  
tion I have ever seen of the  
Champlain Shakespeare Festival.  
Gone was the static, tableau  
based directing of Ed Feidner.  
The blocking was fluid, the  
clowns were enjoyable, the slap-  
stick was imaginative and per-  
fectly timed.  

She may know Shakespeare,  
but Melzer sure doesn’t know  
about women’s consciousness.  
Why should she? She’s from  
Israel. The social position of  
women in Israel is a paradoxical  
combination of professional  
freedom and social oppression.  
My recent visit to Israel revealed  
that relationships between the  
sexes are stuck at about U.S.  
circa 1968. So the questions  
become:  

(1) Why didn’t anyone clue  
her in?  

(2) Why did the Champlain  
Shakespeare Festival choose this  
play to begin with?  

Choose any of the following  
answers, or a combination there-  
of,  

(1) The Champlain Shake-  
speare Festival really does think  
wife-battering is funny.  

(2) They thought they were  
being radical by having a woman  
direct a play praising wife-beat-  
ing.  

(3) They believe art and  
politics are forever separate, and  
if a play’s a classic, content is  
irrelevant.  

(4) They hate women.  

(5) They hadn’t yet done  
Taming of the Shrew.  

Regardless of reason, an  
excellent production, Taming of  
the Shrew is not a play for  
current times. I wish Melzer had  
used her talents in a different  
play. I hope she returns to the  
Burlington area next year. (We  
can be sure they won't have her  
direct The Merchant of Venice.)
