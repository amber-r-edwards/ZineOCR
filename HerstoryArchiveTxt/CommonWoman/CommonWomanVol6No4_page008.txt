WOMEN and...

Women and Nonviolence  
By Catherine Reid  

(I preface my statements  
here with the explanation that  
for the past several years, I have  
worked mostly with women and  
children. My observations are  
based on this experience of  
watching big boys in their  
assumed-authority roles, and  
small boys in pre-school situa-  
tions. My political work has  
been mostly focused on an  
analysis of militarism, mainly  
the equation of sexuality and  
violence, and what this main-  
tains in the societal treatment of  
women.)  

For many years I have been  
trying to figure out nonviolence  
theory, wanting an objective  
analysis of it as a political  
procedure, wanting to under-  
stand it as a lifestyle. I feel the  
theory of nonviolence is still in a  
process of definition. And I feel  
it is far different for women  
than the new left has it defined  
for men. It was of interest for  
me to read works of Gandhi,  
King, Gregg; but it has been  
through the writings of radical  
women and my own experience  
that has given me the vocabulary  
for the nonviolence I’m seeking  
to live.  

Traditional theories of non-  
violence have not touched the  
systematic oppression of  
women, the derived patriarchal  
power based on ownership of  
others — specifically women. To  
me, no dialogue about non-  
violence can begin without  
acknowledging this brutal and  
bloody past and present. As a  
woman, nonviolence begins in  
my refusal to be victimized. And  
— like the theories of feminism  
and anarchism — it says I  
demand to be respected. We  
assert the respect due others in  
our refusal to be violent. Barbara  
Deming (a lesbian-feminist writ-  
ing about nonviolence — for  
decades) writes: “We act out  
respect for ourselves by refusing  
to cooperate with those who  
oppress or exploit us. And as  
their power never resides in their  
single selves, always depends  
upon the cooperation of others —  
by refusing that cooperation...  
refusing our labor, our wits, our  
money, our blood upon the  
battlefields, our deference, we  
take their power from them.”  

Inherent in this situation of  
mutual respect is the respect for  
my experience as a woman. I  
have learned to trust my distrust  
of men. I have learned enough  
about the socialization of men —  
and have reached unresolved  
questions about what is inherent  
in their nature — to know to not  
look to them for anything.  
Especially not to look to those  
in positions of “authority:”  
police, sheriffs, legislators. How  
many do we collectively know  
who are rapists or batterers?  
Here in Chelsea the sheriff's best  
friend, often deputized by him  
to help in arrests, is a rapist and  
batterer. Any changes in our  
situation will not come from  
them. We must look to our-  
selves, to each other for the  
envisioning and inventing.  

The second emphasis in this  
definition of nonviolence is that  
of legitimating our anger. As  
women we have a right to be  
angry. It doesn’t take much  
seeking to find reasons. Like the  
footbinding we have all endured,  
wearing skirts, doing girl’s  
things, watching while the boys  
played; the crippled role models  
held up for us; the grandmothers  
who labored to put brothers  
through school; the great-grand-  
mothers who wore 15 lbs.  
of undergarments and weren’t  
allowed to speak in public; the  
great-great-grandmothers who  
had examples of sorcery burned  
before their eyes. Getting to the  
place where we acknowledge our  
fury begins the interruption of  
the woman-as-victim cycle. So  
fueled, I want to work with my  
anger.  

“Thirdly, nonviolence, to me,  
means no-power-over. As women  
we need to feel powerful, to feel  
in control of our lives. That  
power cannot be taken from us  
against our will. We may some-  
times choose to temporarily  
relinquish it, in times of crisis, or  
mental anguish, but never can it  
be taken without our consent.  

“It is my stubborn faith,”  
writes Barbara Deming, “that if,  
as revolutionaries, we will wage  
battle without violence, we can  
remain very much more in  
control of ourselves, of the  
responses to us which our  
adversaries make, of the battle as  
it proceeds, and of the future we  
hope will issue from it.”  

With this, then, as the  
foundation for my philosophy,  
how to proceed in living non-  
violently? The greatest challenge  
to all of us is in the naming  
of ourselves. In our defiance to  
accept that subservient place  
assigned for us, property of men,  
we begin a species. A  
woman who believes in her right  
to exist, to explore fully our  
own potential. It has been fear  
that has kept us from exploring  
this place. A fear literally burned  
into our flesh, tortured into our  
memories, our spiritual and  
physical beings. Until we over-  
come this fear we can draw no  
strength from ourselves. This  
fear that we can be un-  
womaned, that it has been left  
up to others to name us.  

In my own experience I  
have watched this coming-out  
process in myself and in others.  
The fear is manifested in saying  
“all” is o.k. There is nothing  
wrong. It begins when we are  
born. We know our fathers,  
brothers, male friends with an  
affection. We allow the religious,  
historical, societal tradition of  
male gods, male protectors to be  
the norm. Soon (hopefully) the  
startling contradiction begins.  
We see the pain, the blood, the  
crippling of women. If we dare  
to continue we see the total  
domination of women by men;  
the literal ownership of and  
consequent manipulation of us  
as women. Usually this is  
accompanied by great fear and  
paranoia. Persecution dreams  
may ensue. A fear of the bruta-  
lity that will then be consciously  
directed against us for daring to  
defy, to question this tradition.  
Many women get stuck here. Or  
return to the “all is o.k.” place.  

The challenge remains: get-  
ting through this place to the  
place that says, I am strong. I am  
a woman. I am not afraid of  
you.  

Men are terrifically afraid.  
Those most afraid are those who  
devise the biggest weapons. Wars  
are devised by old white gener-  
als, terribly afraid of their  
new impotency. In my work with  
pre-schoolers, I see the boys  
unable to trust themselves. All  
reinforcements — from fathers,  
TV, comics, heroes — is to put  
that trust in an external force. A  
boy wants to be powerful. He  
wants a gun, a sword, a whip.  
Boys will build elaborate block  
buildings, villages out of sticks in  
the sand by the river. Then blow  
it all up with an imaginary war.  

I once brought a dead snake  
into Playschool. We were going  
to dissect it. Find out about skin  
and ribs and how a snake travels  
and digests and bends. The Star  
War kid, most known for his  
ability to pretend battles, couldn’t  
watch, couldn't even be in  
the same room.  

Hunting season: a weapon  
in a big boy’s hand and he walks  
differently, talks differently.  
Cops do it; soldiers and guards.  

“Power never resides in their  
single selves.”  
Herein lies our response.  

Our strongest stand can be made  
in confrontation and in our  
refusal to cooperate with the  
systems from which they derive  
power, confronting them with  
their own selves. Demanding  
they take responsibility for their  
selves.  

When men are most afraid  
they try to take power over  
women. They wield penises like  
pistols. Perhaps the punishment  
for rape should be dismantling  
this weapon: castration. If boys  
can't take responsibility for their  
weapons, then they can't use  
them. Too often it’s the victim  
who is penalized. Curfews are  
put on women when rape  
becomes a media issue. Rape  
laws further punish the victim  
by traditionally making amends  
to her owner: father, husband,  
brother.  

There is great power in  
asking a man his name. Challeng-  
ing him to acknowledge some-  
where his own self. How often  
have we seen at demonstrations  
that as the violence begins to  
escalate, a cop removes his  
nametag.  

For these reasons I question  
the use of weapons against this  
violent institution. Trusting a  
weapon puts faith in a force  
outside ourselves. It seems so  
important that the change begin  
within ourselves. That we learn  
to trust who we are. That we  
trust our creative responses, our  
knowledge that we are, that we  
are refusing to be their victims,  
their prostitutes, their pawns.  

We are then the most powerful.  

The conflict that arises is  
how much violence in our  
personal lives can we employ to  
protect ourselves from being —  
again — the victim? I struggle  
with this and know how per-  
sonal the issue is, how we must  
each reckon this position for  
ourselves. And I know I speak  
from a privileged place of white  
middle-class educated woman. I  
know I am strong. I know I am  
intelligent. I will do what is  
necessary to keep from being  
raped or attacked. I will do what  
is necessary to keep a greater  
harm from being done. I don’t  
want to put any faith in external  
weapons. I believe this undoes  
the potential for my response. It  
is a distraction to have to think  
“where is the weapon, how can I  
get to it, or prevent it from  
being used on me?”  

I want to respond suddenly,  
confrontatively. I want to pro-  
tect myself with my voice, my  
fury, my fists or feet if neces-  
sary.  

I would say here that I  
cannot condemn or condone the  
methods by which a woman  
chooses to take power over her  
life. It is essential that a woman  
does. Rather I would stress the  
attitudinal change that I would  
insist comes first. And I would  
ask that we continue to share  
ways that have worked. Recently,  
when confronted by a  
carload of drunk boys, intent on  
harassing us at a woman's dance,  
throwing snowballs and insults  
at the building, I went out and  
stood next to one boy with a  
snowball in his hand. I stood so  
close he couldn’t throw it (an  
arm's length away). He dropped  
it, seemed sheepish, acted stu-  
pid.  

I would suggest reading the  
essay in the March Ms. magazine  
about the use of handguns and  
the author's personal story of  
instituting change in the violence  
of a public high school by  
demanding a respect for herself  
and reciprocating it to the  
students.  

And I would urge self-  
defense groups, formats for  
which we can share responses.  
Safe places to learn “to feel o.k.  
about ourselves, and strong  
in our strengths.  

I’ve recently begun working  
with pre-schoolers to help them  
realize why they can’t let  
anyone hurt them, and how to  
implement self-defense, especial-  
ly against peers.  

So where do we go from  
here? Always an intent of these  
discussions is to offer some more  
future visions and methods.  

For myself, the greatest  
consistency in my today and  
tomorrow remains in making  
women and children the priority  
of my work. The content  
of this work is in supporting  
women and children in learning  
to trust themselves, to dare to  
take themselves seriously, to  
refuse to be victimized any  
longer. To name our own selves.  

In a larger political context,  
I want to continue in my analy-  
sis of the militarism presiding  
over our society. The military,  
and all the forms it takes, is the  
mechanism by which the patriar-  
chy maintains its power. I  
recently wrote a chapter for the  
new edition of Aint Nowhere  
We Can Run, A Handbook for  
Women on the Nuclear Men-  
tality, outlining ways militarism  
permeates our lives, our educa-  
tion, our schools, our institu-  
tions. This blatant way of  
maintaining power, so obviously  
against our wills, demands our  
attention. The equation of sex-  
uality and violence that exists  
here, condoned in training such  
as, “In the Army I've got two  
guns; one’s for shooting, the  
other’s for fun;” that stinks  
through war talk such as  
describing phallic weaponry as  
exploding like erections in shiny  
vaginas of steel, emphasizes that  
as women we should disentangle  
ourselves from anything that  
supports militarism.  

I think there is still validity  
in large demonstrations; there is  
a format in which to vent rage  
and keep it in the public’s (read:  
media’s) eye. But I feel the more  
important work is on ourselves,  
increasing our own strength and  
our awareness of the bonds that  
cripple us. Doing work locally  
is more important to me. It is in  
our own communities that we  
make headway. We need courage  
to stand up with the conviction  
of who we are, demand respect  
for that, then figure out how we  
are going to live together.  

It is in my work with  
children that I am most chal-  
lenged. It is here that I must be  
most clear about my values. I  
demand a respect for myself  
from the children and try to  
reciprocate it. I won’t let them  
hit or abuse me, as I won't do to  
them.  

They look at me skeptically  
when I take away their weapons  
and remind them that words are  
their strongest resources. Learn-  
ing to communicate is the  
greatest skill they will need. I  
feel it is ours, too.
