Notes from the Core

Commonwomon needs all material submitted to be typed,
double-spaced. Articles should not exceed four pages in length. If
you want unused material returned, enclose a SASE.

The Editorial Committee would really like reader feedback
on what we put in the paper. We often have to make choices for
space reasons and would appreciate your input.

We need money. The bank account is empty. If not for a
large contribution from a local woman (thank you, amiga), this
issue wouldn’t be paid for. We need your help... there are only a
few of us, we can’t do it all forever. Want to hold a fundraiser

for us? Want to give us a tax-deductible contribution? Got any
better ideas?? Help!

Fantasies, dreams... Send Wild-
Womon cover drawings complete
to fit in the usual C.W. cover
space. Imagine a paper full of
our wildest woman images. Mark
all submissions specifically for
wild womon issue. Do it!

Reid does have an article also in

For Peace

Every day, the news is full of
war and the U.S. government, right in
the middle, is endangering all of our
safety. Ronald Reagan’s aggressive
policy is pushing World War III even
as he declares his action is preventing
it. We grieve the death of Marines as
well as the thousands who have died
in their Middle East homeland. We
are outraged by the invasion of
Grenada, the overt action against
Nicaragua, the deployment of nuclear
weapons to Europe and the poverty
and despair that falls on our own
country as a result of this war making. I know how hard it is to get
motivated and stay motivated. But
please, let’s help each other to

respond in many, many ways. Write

letters, register your shock and
disapproval every day by calling the
public opinion lines. Force Reagan to
feel the peace movement. Granted,
this is not how any of us in this
world want to spend our day. But
this is the time in history we were
given. Let's face it with courage.
Please xerox this and send it to a
friend — add your own note of
encouragement — a chain letter of
support, a call to action, a commit-
ment to peace.

With great love and respect for
us all — for peace.

To the Editor:

Sendra, thanks for doing the
work on books and bookstores. One
comment I have to make is about the
availability of Commonwomon in the
bookstores mentioned. Battery Street
bookstore refused to carry Common-
womon, Wit and Wisdom, unless
they've changed management in the
last few years, was hesitant to be nasty
about carrying Commonwomon or
paying for copies sold. Cold Island
Books keeps it on the floor with a
can for payment, unlike any other
paid for item in the store. Bookstacks
has, of course, been excellent: no
problem with Bear Pond books in

Bisexuality

Dear C.W.

Your reprint of an article from
LA entitled “Bisexual Interconnection (Thoughts on Being Mulatto)”
was in my opinion a poor way to use
C.W. space. The author seemed very
confused and defensive. The analogy
of bisexuality to being mulatto is
distasteful to me (I assume it's an
analogy). I’m sure she has far more
privilege as a bisexual than she would
as a person of color. Give me a break!

“She says she’s not “choosing”
her bisexuality which feels like she’s
not taking responsibility for her
sexual power. It’s true, as she states,
that economic and survival needs are

reasons for relating to
men and lesbians of all classes need

to understand that, but if the woman
has experienced a consequent loss of
self-esteem because she’s chosen this

compromise she can’t blame this on

lesbians.

There are some reasons (including nitty-gritty physical turn off)
why lesbians might not be attracted
to bisexual women. This does not put
these women down... it is merely an
absence of attraction.

There have been some clear,
honest and responsible articles by
local bisexual women in C.W. and I
welcome more of the same.

I'd like to see an article about
the concept or existence (or non-
existence) of bisexual feminist sup-

port groups, affinity groups or
communities.
As ever,

Slinky
Dear Commonwomon:
I hope someone out there

besides me noticed and was offended
by the ads for Sidney’s lingerie —
modeling sessions for men only —
during the pre-Christmas season. For
a while my sweetie had been hinting
that she would like something slinky
and outrageous. It wasn’t really clear
whether she wanted to wear it or
wanted me to, but I had decided we
could figure that part out later, and
had started thinking about going
shopping when I saw the ads. I have
heard since that a couple of women
just went ahead and attended. I wish
I had thought of that, but I was so
angry about the men-only policy that
I wouldn't think of buying anything
from Sidney's anyway. Luckily I
found something quite gorgeous
somewhere else, so this story has a
happy ending, but I would still like
to find something to do about that
policy and those ads. Anybody else
out there of like mind?
Zorra

mentioned in your article) always
puts Commonwomon in the deepest
dustiest corner they can find, and
Everyday Books takes kind of a
neutral attitude by putting it outside
where it gets lost among numerous
larger papers. Readers might note
how often Commonwomon is avail-
able but out of sight, at Leunigs,
for example, where there is usually
an entertainment calendar covering
our display box. If you use book-
stores that don’t carry Common-
womon, or you can’t find it, and
you’re feeling particularly spunky,
ask about it.

Women Artisans

As a working artisan who
recently opened a shop in Gatlinburg,
Tennessee (The Brass Menagerie), I
feel very isolated from other women,
not to mention other woman arti-
sans.

From this isolation has come a

dream: I envision a non-profit
organization, international in scope,
of woman artisans. Until formal
organization (hopefully no later
than January 1984) I am calling it
simply the Alliance of Woman

Artisans. All that follows is the result
of my own thinking and is of course
subject to ratification, rejection, or
modification by the voting member-
ship.
Purpose: (1) To promote
woman artisans through (a) a direc-
tory to be updated as membership
warrants; (b) catalogs, both wholesale
and retail; (c) a community with our
own land where a woman artisan may
live permanently or temporarily to
renew herself and/or immerse herself
in her craft; (d) traveling groups, or a
rotating basis, for shows and work-

shops.

(2) To give mutual social,
psychological, and professional support.

(3) To help other women
become self-supporting through

apprenticeships and workshops.

Membership: (1) Voting: open
to any woman artisan who derives a
major portion of her income from
her craft. (2) Non-voting: any woman
who is interested in supporting and
promoting quality crafts by woman
artisans.

Any input is very welcome and
all letters will be answered.

To finance this organizational
effort I have designed signs and
T-shirts (see drawing below) which
I will sell for $10 (plus $2 for shipping
and handling). When ordering please
specify (1) sign or shirt, (2) single or
double woman’s symbol, and (3) size
(S, M, or L) for T-shirt. All proceeds
beyond actual cost will go into
organizational expense: printing, pos-
tage, etc.

If you are interested or know
anyone who might be, please contact
me at the address below.

Hi, Wild Sisters

How are you and Common-
womon?

It seems women keep find-
ing me in Commonwomon. Could
you send the issues published after
August?

Here is a new article. Hope
you like it. If you don’t want to
publish it, can you return it? Sorry I have no typewriter. If you want to
edit it, that’s fine as long as the
content doesn’t change.

For the time being, I live in
a rural village on Lake Chapala,
an hour from Guadalajara. It has the
best climate in the world: sunny all
year round, temperature range, at the
moment, 60-74 degrees F. The
abundance of colorful flowers is
beautiful. I rented a one-bedroom
house with a beautiful garden with
lemon, papaya, mango, avocado,
peach, orange and banana trees and
camping space. Traveling lesbians,
especially low-income and lesbians of
color are welcome. Write ahead
of time to make sure I’m in. January
is a big fiesta in Jocotopec. If you get
cold to the bone, do drop in for a
bit of sunshine and easy life. I'd love
to see you here.

After initial culture shock
caused by going from living in a
tent on women’s land with dykes to
having a home of my own in the
middle of a small Mexican family-
oriented village, I'm beginning to
pick up Spanish and enjoy life.

For the first time in a decade,
I'm not involved with feminists and
dykes. My days have just been
floating and I feel like a Victorian
lady of leisure. Luckily letters from
friends start arriving and my pen
begins flowing again and the enclosed
article is the result. I sent it to
you because I love Burlington/

Vermont women and I love Com-

monwomon.

I feel in exile from my lesbian
tribe. People are friendly here and
very connected. There are lots of
children who are very playful — only
men and boys ride donkeys, cows
and horses. The women do wash
daily by hand yet there is lots of
laughter, talk, music and fiestas. Life
has a very special quality here. The
people have a natural dignity.

Yesterday, I went to an educa-
tion lecture. The teacher talked
about the importance of believing in
the possibilities, the intelligence of
each child, about collaboration in
creating a new world, believing in our
various capabilities — inner self-image
as well as work. Her Spanish was
clear and I was so proud I could
understand some essentials. I’d like
to talk more to her about her new
ways of education. In Guadalajara,
prisons focus on rehabilitation and
the New Social Readaptation and
Crime Prevention Center treats the
internees individually and respects
basic human rights. It offers skills
training and friends and family can
visit twice a week in visiting areas
where internees can spend a night a
week with their spouses or lovers.
Mexico seems a real people's
country although I miss feminist
consciousness. The men are the boss.
Yet the women look dignified and
have such warm smiles. People seem
happy without the luxuries that
clutter our “civilized countries.” I
don’t know yet I’m beginning to love
this village at the foot of the hills on
the beautiful lake. Well, hope to hear
from you soon,

Love,

Myra Lilliane
