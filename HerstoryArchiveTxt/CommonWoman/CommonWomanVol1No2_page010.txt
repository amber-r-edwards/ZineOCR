reminist
therapy

us to get to a point where we are
all human beings together —
male and female — whatever that
will mean, and I'm not sure what
it will mean. It might mean
bisexuality for instance,
although I’m not actively
bisexual myself.

In a very broad way, being a
feminist means to me to
understand that we're all human
and have the same rights, the
same needs. I have a
“masculine” side to me that
needs to be expressed, and my
husband has a “feminine” side
that needs to be expressed.
We're both being deprived. I do
think that the deprivation falls
mainly on the female, but there
is a male deprivation, too. I
don't want to overemphasize
that, because I get irritated
thinking that we might end up
talking about the poor man and
what's happening to him when I
really think that we need to talk
more about what's happening to
the woman. And eventually get
to the point where we can talk
about both of them.

So that’s where I am, and I
don’t know if that makes it
easier for you to talk some more
about what feminist therapy
means to you.

PEG: The problem for me is
thinking of it in terms of a label.
I know that, as a therapist, I
have a certain attitude about the
direction in which women need
to go. I don’t know if that fits
the label “feminist therapist.”
DIAN: Do you think that there
are in fact therapists who think
of themselves with the label
“feminist therapist,” whereas
there are others like you who
don't label yourself and end up
doing humanist therapy?

PEG: Probably.

DIAN: I think that
psychotherapy has changed a lot
in the last 10 years. It probably
changed before that, too, but in
the last 10 years there’s been a
lot of change because of the
women’s movement. What does
that mean to you?

PEG: I think it’s had a great
effect on the kinds of problems
people come in with. We used to
have women coming in
dissatisfied with their marriage
and what they came in for was
to find ways to be satisfied —
not to change the relationship,
but to change themselves so that
they could cope with it.

And then there was a phase
where people would be coming
in and there'd be power struggles
over the housework — who was
going to do the housework and
dividing up the roles in that way.

What happens more now is

that women come in much
clearer in what their needs are —
that they need to have their
feelings accepted, that they need
to be treated with respect, to be
seen as equal, to have more
freedom. But always in the
background is the option to
leave — I think that’s new. Along
with the women’s movement, or
perhaps because of it, women
are more in the workforce now,
and it’s done wonders.
DIAN: And what has happened
to men in this time period?
You've said there were three
stages: dissatisfaction with
marriage, arguments over
housework, and women asking
for their needs to be met. What
has this meant to men?

PEG: Okay. If I were to parallel
the stages for the male half of a
couple coming in, the early stage
would have been the man
coming in acquiescently, being
bewildered by the fact that the
woman was not satisfied,
because the man would see
nothing wrong with the
relationship. Then there was a
token acknowledgment that
there were things that needed to
be changed and there was
emotional resistance to it. Now
there are a great many more men
coming in with the same issues
as the women do — that their
relationships are not meeting
their needs and they want to
change them so that they will.

But I'm sure that there’s still a
whole segment of the population
that won't come to therapy
because that’s still not totally
acceptable in some circles. The
people who it’s acceptable to are
the people who are into the
change.

China

... everyone bicycles.

... everyone has electricity —
no one has refrigeration.

... elderly people are highly
respected.

... people are overwhelmingly
healthy — no one profits off of
sickness.

... the people are
overwhelmingly honest. Bosha
experienced complete honesty in
dealing with the Chinese people
around money and goods.

The People’s Republic of
China is a reality I have only
begun, after briefly talking to
Bosha, to understand. Yes,
everyone dresses the same —
clothing is classless and sexless
(uncomparative); no, everyone
does not think the same —
people express differences of
opinion — people speak without
rhetoric. My images are
changing. I feel in awe, and yet
skeptical of the equality among
sexes and among peoples.

Clearly, I have not in this
paper talked about political
workings — about what
structures economic and social
exist in China. My impressions
are barely surface, they need
much exploration. Hopefully as
more and more people visit
China our information and
therefore ability to analyze this
country’s seemingly dramatic
differences will increase.
