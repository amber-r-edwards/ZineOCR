Rose

Continued from Page 7

I left after a few days. I was now
living with Rose and Phil in
Florida without the loving,
needed support of my womyn
friends. Rose and I talked about
this. We also talked about
being support for each other. We
kept accurate complete journals
for the next weeks of all bodily
changes and every bit of food
intake, and feelings. I decided to
follow a raw fruit and vegetable
diet with her. All food we ate
was alive, giving us life energy to
use to heal ourselves and each
other. The sun-filled fruit and

vegetables of Florida were rich
with healing energy. We searched
for organic food in nearby towns
and met many health-searching
people. Lynn and Phillip planted

a large beautiful garden in
mid-December.

My memories of my mother
were reinforced on this visit. She
is feisty, strong and angry. She
has a keen sense of personal
politics. My long-held images of
her strength and her support of
my life choices and her willing-
ness to learn from me (not only
the reverse) gave me some of the
needed trust and strength to go
to Florida. Also, my own healing
process of the last year helped
me trust myself to be able to
help her.

For the next weeks, we
talked about many self-healing
ideas and about the alternatives
open to someone with cancer.
Phillip and Rose and I talked
about Phillip’s distrust of non-
medical-establishment therapies.
Would he be supportive, i.e.
would he support her through a
healing crisis? Would he not
insist on her return to the
hospital if she appeared very sick
while healing herself? He agreed
to be supportive. We talked
often about the power dynamics
between the sick person and her
supposed “healer”... SHE the
passive participant, the doctor
the empowered party. We agreed
that this would have to be a
different process. Phillip and
Rose and I fought the Tampa
General Hospital staff and ad-
ministration for Rose’s medical
records. She was the first person
in the hospital’s 60 plus years
history to want her records to
take them herself to an alterna-
tive discipline of her choice.

In a health food store near
Rose’s house, we met a woman
who has cancer and is incredibly
knowledgeable of alternative
healing therapies and the politics
of the popular health movement
of the 60s and 70s. We often
invited her in the next weeks.
She told us of a holistic healing
center in St. Petersburg, Fla.,
that was doing a widely known
cancer therapy involving the use
of megavitamins, raw food diet,
wobe-mogus enzymes and laetrile. We visited the clinic and
talked with the osteopathic
physician and patients there. We
read all we could on this ther-
apy. We had actually read the
theory behind this therapy in
most of the readings of the
previous couple of weeks. Holis-
tic health therapy REQUIRES a
belief system that knows that a
body will heal itself from a
dis-ease if given healthy food,
air, sunshine, emotional ease and
an understanding of why the
disease state happened. Natural
hygienists have a somewhat
differing, not basically agreeing
idea about cancer. It involves an
understanding of the way cancer
grows, how the cancer cells
protect themselves, that the
cancer grows in an unhealthy
body and that the whole organ-
ism needs to be treated and then
the cancer can be and will be
dissolved and sloughed out. This
is a very oversimplified attempt
to describe a very intricate study
of cancer by the alternative
health movement worldwide.
There is incredibly good
reading material available at
most health food stores about
healing chronic and acute dis-
eased conditions. Rose, Phillip,
some of Rose’s and my friends
and I read and exchanged most
of that material in the last few
months. Much of this reading
describes the harassment of this
grassroots health movement by
the FDA (Food and Drug
Administration) and the AMA
(American Medical Association).
A political understanding of the
male-dominated, profit-making
health empire is necessary and
stimulating to anyone who needs
to make informed, responsible
choices about their own, a
friend’s or a child’s health care.
There is legislation in Congress
now about the unconstitutionality
of nonpayment by insurance
and governmental payment plans
to alternative healing disciplines.
This is an issue of individuals
having the freedom to choose an
alternative healing system. This
legislation has existed in differ-
ent forms for many years.
A very interesting political
struggle is revolving now around
the American Cancer Society,
which is Rockefeller Foundation
funded. The ACS has tested
approximately 55,000 cancer
“cures” that are petroleum
based substances. 30,000 have
proved to cause or trigger cancer
growth in and of themselves.
None are a cure. But the Rocke-
feller conglomerate will only
financially back substances that
are petroleum products. This multibillion dollar corporation has very exten-
sive petroleum industry invest-
ments.
Rose

and I learned the

politics of health along with the
search for health. We heard
personal stories of cancer
patients denied laetrile by FDA
mail seizures of the vitamin.
Many of these people got worse
during the months of the ban.
Previously they had stopped the
growths or their cancers were
regressing.

Rose and I ate an almost
totally raw food diet for one-
and-a-half months. We touched
more openly and freely than
ever before in our lives. We
worked through difficult pro-
cesses of decisions about treat-
ments. We examined our mood
and body processes looking for
clues to our health state.

In the two months that I
lived with my mother I saw
phenomenal changes in her
health and outlook. Her hair
texture and color changed, her
eyes were not swollen and red
for the first time in years. Her
skin peeled an amazing amount
and was replaced by new softer,
less pale skin. Her body elimina-
tions were intense. She passed a
small black tumor from her
rectum one night. We watched
wide-eyed, respectful of her
body's insistence on becoming
health-full again. Throughout
this process Rose and Phil and I
read journals of cancer patients.
We visited natural hygiene re-
sorts. Rose became clearer and
clearer that she was her own
healer. She is her own lead in
this healing process. While doing
massage together she would lay
her hands over her liver and
lungs and say, “Don’t be scared,
liver, you will heal yourself.”
She decided recently to stop
taking the hospital prescribed
dilantin that would suppress the
seizures. The dilantin has a
strong effect on the production
of pancreatic enzymes that are
directly involved in the cancer-
healing process. She has not had
another seizure. She is making
very knowledgeable decisions
about her healing process. She is
also working with the holistic
clinic to be better informed
about her internal body chemis-
try and its changes. Her three-
month blood tests show that her
body has returned to a “normal,”
not dysfunctional state and her
bodily environment is now cap-
able of healing itself.

My process with Rose was
not always joyous and easy. By
the time I left Florida I had
immense anger and confusion
about Rose. It was an incredibly
difficult process for me to be
very vulnerable and open to my
mother. We had not lived
together for 12 years. I had not
been close friends with a man or
a heterosexual couple for four
plus years. Rose is my biological
mother. No other person has so
much power or has had so much
power in my life. I feel so
vulnerable to her images of me
and her rejections. I am needy of
her support and understanding. I
also want her to make self-loving
changes in her life. My politics,
my beliefs urge me to push her,
i.e. support her, to change,
politicize herself. We had many
arguments, discussions.

I decided in three days to go
to live in Florida with my
mother and Phillip. I interrupted
all other living processes here.
That choice disrupted my fam-
ily, friends and myself finan-
cially and emotionally. Still, it
was a very good choice in my
life. I am so loving of all the
womyn who gave me support
through that process. My sup-
port to Rose was crucial in her
healing process. I am now
hopeful that there is an alterna-
tive to what I feared was inevi-
table death from cancer. I am
amazingly knowledgeable and
trusting of my ability to heal
myself of “incurable diseases.”
That information and help is
available to anyone who needs it
through a network of grassroots
support.

Educate yourselves — pre-
pare your minds/bodies with the
knowledge you will need for a
healing crisis. Understand the
political issues of healing. Under-
stand that until you know your
body and how to maintain
health, you are powerless to the
technological medical machine
that purports to heal sickness
and yet is interdependent with
the system that exposes our
delicate organisms to radiation
and surgery and harsh chemicals.
This all is done with an assump-
tion of trust given from the sick
to the powerful.

Take back control of your
body.

The above process is only a
small part of the medical,
physical, emotional process I
experienced for the last few
months. I am open to talking
more with groups or individuals
about my experience.

“If we women are ever to pull
ourselves out of the morass of
self-pity, self-destruction and
impotence which has been our
heritage... then it is perhaps even
more important that we be
supportive of each other's
achievements and successes and
strengths than it is for us to be
compassionate and understand-
ing of each other's failures and
weaknesses.”
