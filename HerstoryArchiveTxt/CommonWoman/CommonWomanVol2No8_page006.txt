Rita Mae Brown: A Vital Feminist

By Dian Kendrick Mueller  
Rita Mae Brown is alive and  
exciting, although some women  
in the community think she is  
passe. They say she said every-  
thing she had to say years ago,  
and is now just repeating herself.  
I don’t agree. I think she pre-  
sents to us the living example of  
a female and feminist writer  
who is surviving and who is still  
taking the time to talk to  
women across the country about  
the nature of art and the realities  
of artistic success.  
Rita Mae spoke to a Burling-  
ton audience of about 250  
women and men on October 26  
at the Ira Allen Chapel at the  
University of Vermont, as a  
benefit for the Creamery Educa-  
tion Foundation. Although her  
talk was less than sparkling, she  
presented throughout the even-  
ing — which included an auction  
of her books and a question and  
answer session following her  
speech — an image of an invol-  
ved and vital feminist who is  
interested in reaching women  
who are artists and/or feminists.  
Many women in the com-  
munity did not bother to attend  
because of the $4 admittance  
fee, because they're not very  
interested in Rita Mae, and

because they don’t want to  
support the Creamery. I think  
this was a mistake. I believe the  
Creamery, which has sponsored  
two women’s conferences in  
Vermont in the last two years, is  
doing work feminists should  
support, and I believe Rita Mae  
is worth listening to. She certain-  
ly has been putting her life on  
the line for a long time, and is  
still reaching out actively toward  
women who come to hear her.  

In a talk billed as “Art: The  
Morning Star of the Revolu-  
tion,” Rita Mae said very little  
about revolution, but did define  
her view of art and how to  
succeed as an artist.  

“The purpose of art is that  
we reveal ourselves to our-  
selves,” she said. “The purpose  
and the function is revelatory.  
You must see yourself and the  
culture you live in in a way you  
perhaps haven't before. Art is  
always seductive; it’s always  
going to hit you where you least  
expect it; that’s its power.”  

After noting that art and  
artists are not encouraged in  
America, Rita Mae said:  

“Art attacks ignorance. If  
you have to see yourself the way  
you are, you're going to have to  
take responsibility for correcting

yourself and/or your culture. So  
it might be that what we are in  
America is deeply irresponsible.  
We don’t want to know, we  
prefer to watch the Monday  
night football game. If that’s all  
we’re content to do, it would  
seem to me that this has become  
the most escapist and childish  
culture on the face of the earth  
— if we don’t like something, we  
simply switch the channel.  

“Maybe we have good rea-  
son to hate artists and to push  
them aside. These people disturb  
you, these people upset your  
equilibrium, these people sting  
you — and I'm glad they're  
doing it. I hope you will allow  
yourself to be stung a little bit  
more as time goes by.”  

Rita Mae told her audience  
that the worst place for artists to  
be is in the usual upper middle-  
class pursuits.  

“At 22, after college, we  
have to make a decision about  
what we're going to do. Most of  
us lie to ourselves — I’ll get my  
Ph.D. and be a college professor  
and write in my spare time.  
Trust me — the worst place you  
can be if you're an artist is in a  
college atmosphere. I’m not  
running down college; college  
has a fine place in our society.  

but if you're an artist, college is  
antithetical to everything you're  
trying to do. If you go to  
graduate school, they'll take  
everything you've got and turn  
you into a critic or some other  
pompous asshole, and you won't  
become an artist.  

“If you go into a corporate  
job, the demands are incredible.  
So there goes the time it takes to  
master the skills so you can  
simply do a job at a certain level  
of craftsmanship. We're not  
talking about genius. We're talk-  
ing about a level of craftsman-  
ship where you feel proud of  
what you've turned out.  

“I would encourage you,  
from my experience, to become  
an electrician or a carpenter,  
something you do with your  
hands, something where you're  
out in the world with other  
people who are doing the same  
kind of work, because, number  
one, working class people are  
very exciting — their stories are  
raw and close to emotion — and,  
number two, you'll always be  
able to make a living. Shy away  
from the upper middle-class  
professions and work with your  

hands, because working with  
your hands leaves your mind  
free.”  

Rita Mae spoke from exper-  
ience. Growing up in poverty,  
she managed to go to college,  
and then:  

“One of the things that  
enabled me to do what I did” —  
and this has included writing  
volumes of poetry and such  
novels as Rubyfruit Jungle and  
Six of One — “is that I very  
quickly realized that if I stayed  
in the university I'd never  
become a writer. I’d wind up  
being a marvelous critic or a  
good professor, but I'd never  
produce what I could produce.  

“What I did is I had a little  
red wagon and I lived in New  
York City and I would go to  
abandoned buildings and I'd  
strip brass hinges off the doors  
and take telephones — whatever  
I knew that there was that had  
some antique value — and I'd  
take them down to the antique  
dealers on Hudson Street. I  
stayed alive for years doing that.  

Anti-Nuke  

make nuclear energy look benign  
in comparison. The intentional  
buildup to the 100% overkill  
which the two superpower  
governments are now capable of  
was repeatedly termed “insane”  
and “suicidal.” We can presently  
destroy every key Soviet city 75  
times over, and they us. Forty-  
six percent of the federal budget  
goes to “defense.” Every day is  
crucial in determining whether  
or not the planet and the race  
have a future.  

The October 29 Wall Street  
Action was the first anti-nuclear  
event which confronted the  
financial base of the industry.  
New York police and stock  
exchange employees were well  
prepared for the half day  

attempted shutdown. Business  

I didn't make any money and I  
lived in a cold water flat, and I  
had two little burners, didn’t  
even have a stove, but I had the  
time in which to write.”  

Rita Mae, who has managed  
to make a living with her art,  
warned the audience that this is  
very unusual.  

“Your chances of being  
monetarily successful with your  
art are about the same as your  
chances of being hit by a  
meteorite. Only one percent of  
writers in America make their  
living by writing. So don’t ever  
expect to make a living off what  
you do — but you'll have a full  
life, which is worth a lot more.  
Don’t have any delusions about  
what you're getting into. It’s  
rough and it's rugged — it’s still  
exciting, though. Possibly one of  
the most exciting things you'll  
ever do.”  

Speaking to women writers,  
Rita Mae said:  

“As long as men are at the  
center of your work — either  
negatively as in The Women’s  
Room or positively in some other  
way — you'll get published. And  
if men aren't at the center of  
your work, it will take years to  
get published.  

“The only reason I got  
published was because you  
demanded it, I came out first in  
the small presses and the  
demand was so big the small  
press couldn’t meet it, and when  
Bantam offered to buy them  
out, they took it — with my  
blessing. You can judge nothing  
about the publishing industry by  
my life. I’m one of the few  
people who has a true audience —  
you keep me alive. This is  
extraordinarily rare.”  

Rita Mae Brown is indeed  
rare — an original writer, an  
outspoken lesbian who carries  
the lesbian message to the larger  
world, and a woman whose  
concern for other women does  
not seem to have lessened in the  
years she has spent on the  
lecture circuit. She does what I  
would like to do if I had the  
talent, the courage, and the  
stamina — and I admire her for  
it.  

was not halted and “trading was  
up;” a few employees opted to  
take the day off and perhaps the  
consciousness of some brokers  
and bankers was raised, or at  
least dented. About 250 police  
were present, very professional  
and disciplined in their use of  
sporadic force against protestors.  

One cop on a horse half  
lifted a man seated on the  
sidewalk off the ground by his  
hair, and the cops used their  
horses and sticks to move  
people around. A fork lift was  
brought in, but once there  
proved ineffective; too much  
press around to steamroller the  
passive resisters. One group  
seated in front of an exchange  
door were allowed to sit unhar-  
assed, and none were arrested —  
why bother when other doors
