PORN

(continued from page 1)

calls much of our knowledge of
sexuality into question, that is,
heterosexuality, for surely we
would do well to examine the
question in the light of what we
have learned and can learn from
both gay men and lesbians.

While the question was
being raised, a massive “system”
or what has been called an
“institution” of violence against
women was being uncovered. It
has been suggested that this
violence is the very force which
controls the position of women
in society. There are no armies,
no uniforms, no systematic
distribution of weapons. The
threat, nevertheless, is implicit in
our daily lives. Robin Morgan
wrote in Going Too Far, “Porno-
graphy is the theory; rape the
practice.” If, then, we believe
that rape concerns aggression, it
is likewise true of pornography.
We could also call pornography a
how-to manual of aggression. To
understand the context then in
which we must deal with porno-
graphy, we would do well to
review the many aspects of
violence against women before
going on to trace women's
actions of the late seventies
which move toward a definition
of pornography.

Beginning with Rape

In the early years of this
decade, women began to publish
studies and to organize rape
crisis centers, to deal with the
growing problem. With the new
focus on rape, other issues of
violence against women began to
emerge. In 1974, Erin Pizzey
published in England, Scream
Quietly or The Neighbors Will
Hear, a study of wife-beating,
with startling evidence of the
extensiveness and severity of the
problem. She writes of child-
beating and incest and tells of
one shelter that treated 5000
women and children over a
period of three years. In 1975,
Susan Brownmiller posited the
theory that rape is not a crime
of passion, but one of aggression
in Against Our Will: Men,
Women and Rape.

Early in 1976, 2000 women
from all over the world gathered
in Brussels to express their
universal concern about all issues
of violence against women and
to study methods of dealing
with them. The issues examined
included forced motherhood;
forced sterilization; crimes per-
petuated by the medical profes-
sion; compulsory heterosexual-
ity; economic crimes against
women (including the problem
of a woman’s dependency on a
man who may be brutalizing
her); forced incarceration in
mental hospitals; the double
oppression of Third World wom-
en, of poor women, of immi-
grant women; women in prison;
genital mutilation; woman-
beating; and the sexual objectifi-
cation of women in prostitution
and pornography. From the
pornography workshop came the
conclusion, “The way men
experience their sexual identity
is oppressive to women because
their sexuality exists only in that
it satisfies men’s need."

Del Martin brought the
problem of wife-beating to the
attention of Americans with the
publication of Battered Wives.

Women Against Pornography

In 1977, women first
marched to take back the night
in England. The phenomenon
quickly spread to North Ameri-
ca; Calgary, Alberta, Washing-
ton, D.C., Denver, Toronto...
Women Against Violence
Against Women organizations

appeared to replace or supple-
ment the early rape crisis cen-
ters. Late in 1976, at a confer-
ence on violence against women
in San Francisco, a proposal was
passed to hold a conference to
study pornography. The Berke-
ley organization Women Against

Violence in Pornography and
Media was formed and the
conference grew to the first

nation-wide conference of its
kind in the United States.
Meanwhile, women in Canada
were working on a definition of
pornography through the Coun-
cil on the Status of Women.

The Feminist Perspectives
on Pornography conference took
place in San Francisco last
November and during the week-
end of the conference a march
to take back the night took
3000 women through the red-
light district to proclaim the
right of women to walk the
streets safely. From a workshop
on “What Is Pornography?” at
the conference came a definition
which combines the work of the
Canadian women and Helen
Longino, animator of the work-
shop, and which emphasizes the
necessity of distinguishing
pornography from erotica:

Pornography is sexual mate-
rial depicting or supporting
violent or coercive or noncon-
sensual acts where an imbalance
of power is implicit or explicit in
such a way as to endorse and/or
recommend the behavior
described or represented.

Erotica is the representation
of sexual pleasure between per-
sons which recognizes respect or
the depiction of one person with
no loss of self-respect involved.

Susan Griffin is writing a
book which she will call Porn-
ography and Silence. She says,
“Silence in this title means the
silence of women. And all the
old ways of silencing we have
met over the centuries: fear,
intimidation, humiliation, ridi-
cule. The making of a woman or
all women invisible.” Not only
have we been silent. We have
closed our eyes. We have not
looked. We have looked away.

On October 20, Women
Against Pornography in New
York, a sister group to the
Berkeley WAVPM, sponsored a
march through Times Square. In
preparation for the march, the
women opened a shop in the
neighborhood and gave guided
tours. WAVPM’s Newspage says,
“Maintaining that pornography
contributes to a ‘climate of
violence’ in which crimes such as
rape, wife battering and child
molestation are on the rise, these
women are urging other women
to tour the bookstores, peep-
shows, and live sex shows...”

In Part Two of this article I
shall describe some pornography, 
its sado-masochistic ori-
gins, and discuss the censorship
of pornography and the First
Amendment. There is a relation
between the two. Exposure to
pornography weakens the de-
fense based on the First Amend-
ment. Our looking is absolutely
necessary to the elimination of
pornography.

Alix

(continued from page 1)

Alix recently returned from
a European tour where she spent
a good deal of time in Germany.
She spoke at length of her
feelings as a Jew there — never
before having considered going
to that country until her work
presented her the opportunity.

I personally was glad she
took the time at the concert to

explain some of her experiences
in Germany and the varied
reactions she had from German
women’s audiences about their
country’s genocide and current
repressiveness. “We didn’t do
it,” “Why talk about the past,”
etc. were typical comments —
the charged emotions and impli-
cations all compounded by the
need to rely on interpreters.

Alix went on a guided tour
in Germany where women point-
ed out streets that used to bear
women’s names now changed, a
hospital that at one time had
been all-women staffed and run,
a former women’s bank, an
entire village that used to be
working-women-only-inhabited.
Statistics she learned about the
Nazi concentration camps show
that 3/4 of the people killed
were female! Not surprising —
no — not in a nation where more
women were burned as witches
than any other. Another miso-
gynist fact to bear the reality of
and hopefully enragingly move
us to make sure women do not
continue to be destroyed by
men.

I heard feedback from wom-
en that they were bored by
Alix’s raps. I think this is an
understandable “excuse”/re-
action to the heaviness of what
she is saying. One woman went
so far as to admit she stayed
away from the concert because
she didn’t want to be barraged
with this “type” of information.
This kind of attempt at avoid-
ance or ignorance seems irre-
sponsible, wishy-washy and does-
n’t help any of us out of our
common dilemmas. We can do
difficult, serious political work
and enjoy life too. I believe each
of us must figure out her own
way to accomplish this. Alix
Dobkin seems to have achieved a
balance through her music —
which belongs to everyone.

Along with her supra-
affirmative self-stand on her
choice to be a lesbian, she
acknowledges the struggle it can
mean. She talks about her
marriage having been a “web of
lies” and how she finally headed
for ‘Amazonia’ — fa-la-la-latla
freeeeeee. While she wouldn’t
have her life be any other way,
there are those ‘Separations’ —
from children, from families,
from first woman lovers, friends,
monogamy/shbedogamy. All so
difficult and painful for us
dykes; but we've committed
ourselves to struggle to make
changes in the world. With all
seriousness — Alix imparts a
sense of humor. I thank her.

MIDDLE CLASS SMILES

On my last visit home

I spoke to my mother

about ‘how are things’.

She did ask, I’m sure of it.

I said the words

woman oppression lesbian,
abortion childcare rape
violence matriarch struggle.
Words that she might only

have read, never verbalized,

much less thought about them

in relation to herself.

I expressed emotions of

anger love fear hatred

silence frustration.

All emotions that exist

but feelings that she denies

herself behind her middle

class smile. I spoke

uninterrupted until my

mother sensed that I was

through. Sadly and softly

she spoke; Please come home

where you will be safe.

FOR BUT Page 7
Brother, who are you, man?
We stare at each other —
Taking in the real image that washes away
Childhood and adolescent memory.

Who are you blood-like-mine thick hairy men?
I am woman of my mother — am I the same as you?
Yet I am woman of my father — sister of this man,
My brother.
Yes, it’s true — the brow and nose and mouth
Are too like mine to be ignored,

I look for gentleness in you, man
But it is hidden, feared by you
Why do you not celebrate it?
Look, do you see our mother walk differently for you?
Why do you ignore it?

— it is there

Watch out! I will not avoid truth
I will not play childhood games
Of mothering and protection
I will not be dishonest.

We are equals — I cannot say all so
Much, to our mother
However to you, child friend, I will say
Anything.
—Vicki Smith
