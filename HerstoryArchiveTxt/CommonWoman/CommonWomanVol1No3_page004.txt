Halloween:
What’s at Stake

By Linda Wittenberg

October 31 is the Sabbat
Samhain, Witch’s New Year, a
time of reverence for ancestors,
a time of respect for the dead.
Respect for the dead. In
Europe and the United States
between the 15th and the 17th
centuries, hundreds of
thousands, perhaps millions of
women were killed as witches.
This slaughter has been called a
mass hysteria — a craze initiated

from a church and state anxious to

maintain greater control over its
domain — a ridding of heretics,
non-believers, devil worshippers
from the land. It has never
clearly been labelled as a
genocide — as a deliberate and
frightful elimination of women
justified by and armed with the
misogyny and fear of women
that an increasingly powerful
patriarchal Christianity was
spreading. This genocide, or
gynocide as Andrea Dworkin has
called it (gyne being the Greek

root for woman), was as
tortuous, as horrifyingly
inhuman as other more

notorious genocides. Why we
have been denied an accurate
historical representation seems
evidence of the not very well
suppressed misogyny in our
culture.

The word witch comes from
the word wicce which means
wise. Wicked comes from this
word also, as does willow (water
witching — dowsing with a
willow rod). Witches were wise
women. They were women with
an accumulated knowledge
passed down for centuries of
herbs, of healing arts, of
midwifery. They were women
still, maintaining pagan beliefs,
that is, women celebrating the
rites of pre-Christian cultures
and religions. They were
common women, poor women,
old, unmarried, strong women.

They were persecuted and
destroyed because they
contradicted the images of

women, of medicine, of religion,
that those in power (men,
doctors, the church) wanted to
promulgate.

Witch's religion was a
continuance, a survivor of
matriarchal culture. It celebrated
the moon and the moon
calendar, and women, the
mother, the earth, not God the

father, as creators. It was based
on the love of self rather than
the love and fear of God. It was
a self-loving rather than a
sacrificial religion. Their
gatherings were called covens.
Witches came to these evening
celebrations lighting their way
with candles atop broomsticks.
(Broomsticks were a traditional
symbol of the home.) Their
black robes were worn most
likely to make them less visible
in the night woods. Covens, and
Sabbats which were sacred days,
holy days, have often been
depicted as fantastic, sexual,
sensual orgies. This is an image
bred and fostered in fear and
hatred, an image it became
necessary to elaborate on and
engorge as a justification for
mass persecution and murder.

It was with the emergence of

‘professional’ medicine that
women healers began to be
discredited, labelled and

persecuted as witches. Doctors, a
male upper class elite, claimed
themselves as authorities on
healing, claimed witches’ potions
were sorcery (which was a sin),
claimed sicknesses that they
could not cure were caused by
spells. They sought successfully
with the church to eliminate
midwifery which had become a
last holdout of women healers.
Doctors claimed that only those
utilizing forceps should deliver

babies. These were issues of
power and control, not
legitimacy or skill. Midwives

didn’t use forceps. Furthermore,
the church claimed that to lessen
the pain of a woman in
childbirth (that pain given as a
punishment from God to
women) was heresy. Midwives
had developed much knowledge
and skill in facilitating the
birthing process as well as in
performing abortions. The
church’s original objection to
abortion was because
child-bearing, and the pain
associated with it was women’s
God-given lot!

Women’s medicine and
religion began to take on the
image that it has today — of evil

brews, large cauldrons of
poisonous potions, women
flying over the moon. on

The history of Witches is
essentially the history of
misogyny. For although the
term ‘witch’ can be generically
applied to a male or female
being, the stereotype of the
witch is that of a woman... a
woman bound to the Devil by a
pact or contract, as his servant
and assistant.

Most of us carry around a set
of vague notions regarding
witches and witchcraft: at the
very least we can conjure up the
storybook image of an hysterical
hag whose lifeworld consists of
cauldrons, bats, broomsticks,
black cats and the entrails of
animals. These vestigial
characteristics are the accepted
givens of the witch-myth that
has been transmitted in and by
us in our collective unconscious.
Less superficially, the idea of a
being who is other than
ordinary, who is invested with
special powers and who indulges
in heinous acts, is obviously an
attractive and necessary
prototype for our fantasizing
psyche. The history of
civilization is replete with
ascriptions of extraordinary
traits and inhumane actions to
special beings. Sometimes the
assigning of good and evil forces
was explicit, as in the corpus of
written mythology passed down
to us from antiquity. When,
however, what existed as an idea
gets transformed from the realm
of literature into the flesh and
blood of the everyday — one can
ask,
“where did this transformation begin?”

“The stereotype of the witch
as it existed in some parts of
Europe in the fourteenth,
fifteenth and sixteenth centuries
was an amalgam of four notions.
A witch was imagined as (1) an
individual who was bound to the
Devil as his servant; (2) an
individual who practiced
‘maleficium,’ i.e. who did harm
by occult means; (3) an uncanny
being who flew through the air
at night for evil purposes, such
as devouring babies, and who
was associated with wild and
desolate places; (4) a member of
a society or sect which held
periodical meetings or sabbats,
where the Christian religion was
systematically parodied and
where the Devil was worshipped

and also had sexual intercourse
with his human servants.”
(Cohn, N. R., Europe's Inner
Demons)

There is an interesting body
of historical fact that can be
used to explain how these
notions arose. Succinctly, the
witch was catapulted into flesh
and blood through the doors of
the Catholic Church. “In the
second century after Christ the
Christian Communities in the
Roman Empire — still small and
scattered groups — were the
object of strange suspicions and
accusations.” (Cohn) Christians
were strong, willful, and
constituted a real threat to their

political counterparts and
adversaries. The most logical
way of weakening such a

powerful group was to attribute
their influence or success to
untoward and/or mysterious
sources. Many stories abounded
in antiquity regarding ritual
murder and cannibalism —
feeding the stereotype of the
conspiratorial organization or
secret society engaged in a
ruthless drive for power. These
tales of incest and cannibalism
came to be attributed to heretics
and most of the early heretical
groups consisted of learned and
pious Church-affiliated men,
with a few nuns thrown in here
and there for local color.

This is, perhaps, the most
interesting and the most
disturbing fact of all: A heretic’s
choice away from strict Church
doctrine was at once a
submission to the Devil’s will.
Yet, most of the members of the
important ‘heretical’ sects were
men, not women, so those who
originally formed pacts with the
Devil were men. What we need
to ask is how the conceptual
shift from men as heretics (i.e.
witches) into women as witches,
occurred.

It occurred between men and
women of different classes and
with different things at stake,
but it always revolved around
the issue of political power. As
the chronicles of history reveal,
it occurred most viciously from
the late Middle Ages through the
seventeenth century. It would be
naive, by the way, to think of
the witch hunt as a finished
phenomenon. As any strong and

intelligent woman knows, it is an
indeterminate legacy that we all
share today.

Much is written of the peasant
women who were exterminated
for exercising intangible powers
in their healing activities. It is
important to realize that all
classes of women were subject to
unconscionable acts of torture
and extinction based on the
whims of men who feared them.
One of the first ‘historical’
reports of a woman being
burned at the stake was of a
young noblewoman whose
confessor imputed to her
witch-like behaviors. She had
committed no crime and yet his
word was sufficient to end her
life.

The transcultural sex-role
stereotyping of centuries made
the conceptual shift to women
as (the only real) witches, an
easy one. Women as the
biological bearers of the race
(loved for it; hated and feared
for it), women as nurturant,
passive, submissive, emotional
beings; women as the receptive
vessel; women as feebleminded;

women as hysterical (Plato,
Charcot, Freud); — whatever
devaluing notion that one can
imagine: these ideas were

regularly ascribed to the weaker
political group, the latter usually
being the females of a given
societal unit.

Also women as bearers of all
that which was unmeasurable
and therefore unknowable were
a symbolic reflection of all those
aspects of the psyche that were
long devalued in the annals of
psychiatry and psychotherapy.

And, so, my dear Sisters, you
may have not mounted your
broomsticks as of late or
hovered over the summit of Mt.
Mansfield in the arms of an
incubus, but for all of you who
(1) have a mind and use it, and
(2) have a body and enjoy it and
for all those of you who are not
plugged into Madison Avenue
madness (Often they were
frightening to look at — ugly,
with red eyes or a squint, or
pockmarked skin; or somehow
deformed; or simply bent and
bowed with age”), I offer you

this warning: Misogynist
inquisitors are ever at your
elbow.
