Review. For Her Own Good, by  
Barbara Ehrenreich and Deirdre  
English.  

By Carol Wertheimer  

I feel compelled to write  
about For Her Own Good: 150  
Years of the Experts' Advice to  
Women, by Barbara Ehrenreich  
and Deirdre English, because I  
feel that it’s an important book  
for feminists and I want to  
spread the word. Initially I  
wasn't excited about what I  
thought this book would be: a  
catalog of what they had told us.  
I didn't want to put any more  
attention on them. But I had  
read the two pamphlets written  
by these two women and found  
them fascinating, so I wanted to  
give the book a try. (The pamph-  

lets are ‘Witches, Midwives and  
Nurses: A History of Women  
Healers’ and ‘Complaints and  

Disorders: The Sexual Politics of  
Sickness,’ both published by  
The Feminist Press, Old West-  
bury, N.Y.)  

Well, these women’s ideas  
and information continue to  
fascinate me and hold my  
attention, even through 300 plus  
pages of small type. They  
present an economic analysis  
from a feminist perspective of  
the changing roles for women in  
this country over the last 150  
years. The analysis and the  
information are new to me, and  
I want to share my excitement  
with other feminists.  

In the first 29 pages of the  
book, Ehrenreich and English  
present their analysis. Then in  
the 300 pages that follow they  
tell us the herstory of the last  
150 years through that analysis.  
They see the industrial revolu-  
tion as a major herstorical  
change in the course of patriar-  
chy. They don’t concern them-  
selves with whether there ever  
existed a matriarchy (in fact, I  
felt them having some disdain  
for those who do), but they do  
consider “historic (recorded)  
time” to be male dominated.  
Therefore, they go back to  
original sources, the diaries and  
published writings of women, to  
tell women’s story of the last  
150 years. Their extensive use of  

original sources gave me a feeling  
for women’s lives and struggles  
in those times.  

They refer to recorded  
history before the industrial  
revolution as the Old Order, and  
describe it as an essentially  
stable period of thousands of  
years which was organized  
around the family as an econo-  
mic and social unit. They speak  
of this family as heterosexual  
and nuclear and white, and  
ignore the possibilities of lesbian  
and homosexual families, com-  
munally organized, and other  
non-nuclear families, and fami-  
lies within the cultures of other  
races. Nonetheless, it is a wom-  
en’s view of women’s lives, and  
therefore validates much of my  
experience as a woman.  

In the heterosexual, white,  
nuclear family in this country  
before the industrial revolution,  
the women could bear and raise  
children, tend the sick, weave  
cloth and sew clothes, make  
soap and candles, tend animals  
and grow, preserve and cook  
food. The family produced what  
it needed; there was very little  
surplus or trade. The woman in  
the family had many skills, a  
physically tiring life, and no free  
time to consider other options.  
Daughters grew to lead lives very  
similar to their mothers.  

Then came the industrial  
revolution, and the economic  
unit moved from the home to  
the factory, and ultimately to  
the centralized, corporate mar-  
ket economy. “To go from a  
society organized around home  
production to one organized  
around large-scale factory pro-  
duction, from a society ruled by  
seasons and climate to one ruled  
by the Market, is to reach into  
the heart of human social life  
and uproot the deepest assump-  
tions.” (Page 12)  

“The changes were, by their  
nature, contradictory. Industrial  
capitalism freed women from  
the endless round of household  
productive labor, and in one and  
the same gesture tore away the  
skills which had been the source  
of women’s unique dignity.”  
(Page 14)  

The cloth, candles, soap and  
food formerly produced by  
women were now made in  
factories. The factory replaced  
the home as the new economic  
unit, but what was to happen  
with the home as the social unit?  
The home was what kept women  
and children “in their place.”  
And what was to be the new  
economic role for women? What  
would the Market need from  
them? “Biologically and psycho-  
logically, she seems to contradict  
the basic principles of the  
Market.” (Page 18) How men  
could integrate women into the  
Market became “the woman  
question.”  

For Her Own Good describes  
society’s attempts to solve the  
woman question, to create  
socially-approved economic roles  
for women. These roles are  
dictated by the needs of the  
Market (in other words, for  
men’s profit), and by the social  
need to bring order and meaning  
to industrial life. Factory life is  
harsh. Life in the market world  
is portrayed as cold and calculat-  
ing. Thus the home would have  
to maintain the “quality of life,”  
the love, warmth and sense of  
morality. The woman's role  
would be as the nourisher in the  
home, the one who “keeps the  
family together,” and thereby  
maintains the social order. The  
specifics of the role would  
change over time: sometimes as  
the “patriotic worker in the  
wartime factory, sometimes as a  
devoted mother, sometimes as a  
consumer. But always the  
acceptable roles for women are  
defined by men, have inferior  
status to men’s roles, and require  
men for fulfillment.  

So women are still trapped,  
but the forms of the traps keep  
changing. (You might have  
“come a long way baby,” but  
you're still buying those cigar-  
“Experts” have evolved  
to expound to women on the  
way things should be. The  
psychologist, home economist,  
gynecologist, childrearing  
expert, marriage counselor, etc.  
are all self-proclaimed — and  
mutually-endorsed answer men.  

But still the family is falling  
apart, the divorce rate soaring,  
and juvenile crime and drug use  
major social issues. The old  
social order, the family, is not  
surviving in the new economic  
order, the Market.  

For Her Own Good is a  
herstorical analysis of the  
attempts to preserve the family,  

Talent  

By Linda Wittenberg  

If you live in a world where  
music disguised as the disco  
thump invades your space morn-  
ing, noon, and night,  

where the only good humor  
is an ice cream bar,  

where fashion is the tie that  
binds (i.e. fashion = porn =  
sado-masochism),  

where the only place any-  
one talks about personal rela-  
tionships is on the soap operas.  

If you've gone to the  
Burlington Square Mall tee shirt  
store and couldn’t get a shirt  
that said, “Housecleaner Witch,”  
or “Well you've finally met a  
lesbian,”  

If the latest exhibit at the  
Fleming didn’t have any cunt  
art,  

THEN the Burlington Wom-  
en’s Community Talent Show  
was where you should have been  
December 9 — a free Friday  
night with a room full of enter-  
tained and entertaining women.  

I was in the largest group of  
participants, the audience — an  
agonizing, but finally clear  
choice which put me through a  
lot of process about talent, art,  
“stars.” I am amazed to think of  
how many talents we share —  
our talking, stroking, cooking,  
joking, surviving, and how many  
talents we deny because we are  
afraid we will be compared,  
judged; because we don’t have  
the time or money to pursue  
them; because as women we  
haven't been taken seriously;  
because as women our creative  
lives are validated as and focused  
on reproductive creativity.  

If there is a philosophy at Main Street Dance Theatre, it is to  
enjoy oneself through movement. The atmosphere is informal,  
non-competitive and designed to encourage each person to pro-  
gress at his/her own level.

Main Street Dance Theatre — where everyone is moving!  

based on heterosexuality and a  
romantic image of woman, in  
the cold, competitive male world  
of the Market. The authors  
weave together some seemingly  
contradictory threads of recent  
history into a dynamic and  
coherent herstory. It’s a well-  
researched, well-organized and  
well-written tool for feminists.  

The word talent comes from  
a Latin word which means “a  
sum of money.” The women’s  
talent show redefines, recreates  
this word, as our/my talents are  
indeed to create and recreate a  
culture which describes our  
experience, which echoes some  
of our pain and happiness.  
We are so rarely heard. And I  
have so recently learned to listen  
to myself — to hear my friends,  
to see that these women (and I)  
who are my community are  
creating my culture. Their/our  
talent is my future imagined, our  
present exposed, our separate  
pasts regurgitated.  

I am awed at how bare and  
vulnerable these friends make  
themselves to us. (Even to the  
“bathing-suit contest”: enter all  
the women nude — a statement  
however humorous of how we  
have had to reinterpret every bit  
of our reality.) I feel enriched,  
thrilled, overflowing with this  
evening of sharing, that mirrors  
the depth and power of the  
women identified women we
