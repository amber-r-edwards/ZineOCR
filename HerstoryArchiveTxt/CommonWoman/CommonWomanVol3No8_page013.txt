The Gross

National  
Product  

By Peggy Luhrs  

Working on a speech to be  
given at an abortion rights rally,  
I came across an item in the  
local paper about the lower birth  
rate of the past few years. The  
article said experts were con-  
cerned that this lower birthrate  
was bad for the national eco-  
nomy and the National Virility.  
The NATIONAL VIRILITY ???  
Does it correlate with the Gross  
National Product? Taking the  
phrase literally, in my mind it  
certainly does. I envisioned  
governmental agency charts  
graphing this vital resource with  
rising and falling penises; not a  
pleasant picture. My initial  
amusement soon gave way to  
fury at the vicious reality behind  
the phrase. Because men's egos  
were threatened, a campaign  
would be waged against abor-  
tion. Because men’s self-images  
reside in their cocks, women  
would suffer as they always have  
and for that reason.  

Men attempt to legislate the  
fate of women’s bodies and  
therefore their lives, ostensibly  
in the national interest. In this  
light, at least National Virility is  
an unusually honest term. The  
concern these men have for the  
lives they want produced ends  
with the reflection of their

virility. I was once involved in a  
heated discussion with a Ver-  
mont legislator and member of  
“Right to Life.” Exasperated  
and pulling what he thought was  
his trump card, he demanded,  
“if you allow women to have  
abortions when they want, how  
do we know we'll have enough  
men for the next war?” So much  
for the right to life. Women are  
seen as vessels to produce the  
necessary cannon fodder. The  
fetus is sacred because men  
identify with it as the product of  
their cocks. Life is not sacred, it  
is for defending their ideology.  
The male thinking ends and  
begins with the penis as symbol  
of dominance.  

If there were ever any doubt  
about cocks and guns as inter-  
changeable in the male mind, the  
Marine Corps has a chant that  
ties them forever for the new  
recruit. Used in basic training,  
the verse goes: “this is my rifle,  
this is my gun, one is for busi-  
ness, the other’s for fun.” The  
male's fun as witnessed by  
pornography, usually means rape  
and degradation for women.  

Recently, a National  
Enquirer headline caught my eye  
in the supermarket. It read,

CLAIMING AN IDENTITY They Taught Me to Despise by Michelle

Boston and New York spoke  
gravely of the rising number of  
male patients suffering ego  
damage inflicted by the switch  
to smaller cars precipitated by  
economics. A switch that should  
have been made decades ago  
when the oil shortage was first  
foreseen. But the car is a sacred  
vehicle, being a phallic symbol  
and in such ways do men make  
policy.  

Early in my involvement in  
the women’s movement, I clip-  
ped an article relating the rise of  
women’s liberation to the fall of  
the penis or the rise of impo-  
tence. I was cheered by this  
news though I knew it was  
meant to and would inspire guilt  
in many women since it is their  
proscribed duty to pay homage  
to the male and his phallus. He  
can then retain his sense of  
dominance and use it against  
them. I was pleased because I  
knew the penis is a weapon and  

wielder of power for men. If the  
women’s movement was hitting  
them there, then I felt we were  
right on target and we were  
doing it merely by asserting our  
rights as free beings.  

As a lesbian, I rarely spend  
much time thinking about cocks.  
They are not a pretty subject  
and, like their owners, one  
dimensional. But I am surround-  
ed by their presence in the form  
of weapons, talk of war, violence  
against women, pornography,  
authoritarian architecture, cars  
and guns. When I think of the  
problems of women and les-  
bians, it is not so much a ques-  

*tion of what we need to do, as  
of what men must be kept  
from doing and what they keep  
us from doing. Women, lesbians,

have always  
remaking the world as much as  
possible in the midst of the  
destruction and unmaking of  
men. The problems of lesbians  
are not lack of creativity,  
intelligence, imagination or abil-  
ity to work on their part but the  
penile system imposed by men.  
The phallus manifests itself as  
a hierarchy of dominance and  
authoritarianism backed up with  
the technological penis extend-  
ers of weaponry and machinery.  

The good news for women  
is that if the world as it now  
exists is a product of the male  
mind, then by seeing and naming  
it thus, we can begin to erase the  
myth that it is the natural order.  
We can realize that a world  
created and uglified by the male  
imagination can be replaced  
by a different imaging of it. The  
bad news is the extensive resis-  
tance offered by men who see  
their beings inextricably linked  
to the image of penis/weapon  
and who would rather die than  
change that. These are the men  
who are killing us and the  
planet. They must be disarmed.

Musical Midwives had included $200 for salaries as part of  
their expenses. However, the reality is that we didn’t meet our  

expenses, even though a hat pass and additional donations were  
given. A few months ago, Musical Midwives was given a dona-  
tion of $591 by the Burlington Womyn's community. We are in  
the process of deciding how to  
use that money, and if we want  
to use any of it to pay ourselves  
for the hundreds of hours that  
this production has taken. We  
are also in the process of decid-  
ing Musical Midwives’ future —  
i.e., if we'll all continue work-  
ing together, defining the  
group’s philosophy and goals,  
etc. We are open to any and all  
input and can be reached by  
writing Musical Midwives, c/o

St., Burlington, Vt. 05401.  

As this paper went to print,  
we made the decision not to  
work together as a production  
group, although some of us are  
still interested in continuing this  
work. Musical Midwives has  
some front money and other  
resources available for woman-  
oriented cultural productions.  
We can be contacted at the
