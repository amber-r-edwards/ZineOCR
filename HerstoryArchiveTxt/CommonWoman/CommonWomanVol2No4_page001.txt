_._ Sixteen-year-old Paula was
“babysitting her eight-year-old
“nephew one Saturday night four
“years ago when an acquaintance
of her aunt's came over to
borrow some records. Before he
left, Richard Smith had raped
the young woman and killed the
boy.
Some people may rejoice at
‘Richard Smith’s recent convic-
tion for rape and murder.
However, the defense argument
— an insanity plea — highlights
one of the problems in attaining
rape convictions, and demon-
strates the sexist process of the
Vermont judicial system.

I swear it to you

and will risk it

On April 20, 1975, in
Windsor, Vt., the night of the
rape/murder, Richard Smith was
on probation from a previous
kidnapping conviction. He had
also been arrested before on rape
charges, but was not convicted.
His initial insanity defense for
the rape/murder was rejected
and on January 2, 1976, Smith
was convicted. He was sentenced
to life imprisonment by Judge
Hilton Dier of the Chittenden
County Superior Court on April
4, 1976.

However, Smith's attorneys
appealed the conviction to the
Vermont Supreme Court on the
basis that relevant information
was omitted — information
related to the insanity defense.
So, in November of 1978,
Smith’s conviction was over-
turned by Chief Albert W.
Barney.

Smith’s second trial ended
in a conviction on May 29,
1979.

We often forget in reviewing
a so-called success in a rape case,
that the whole process is ridden
with anti-woman sentiment.
Even though the defense lawyers
did not succeed with all their
schemes, the fact that they were
allowed to introduce them at all

‘NUCLEAR REALITIES

presents a challenge to the
legal system as a ground for con-
trolling and dealing with rapists.

Lawyers are supposed to try
every possible means to lessen
the punishment of their client.
Even though their client may be
undeniably guilty of a horrendous
crime — one in which the
prosecution process through the
rusted wheels of ‘justice’ causes
extreme anguish to the victim —
punishment cannot be meted
out until all such means are
tried. In a case where the defen-
dant is obviously guilty, lessen-
ing the punishment usually takes
one of two forms - reducing the
charge, or an insanity plea.

Defense lawyers William
Sessions and Donald Graham
tried the first, but failed. The
woman wasn’t really raped, they
claimed, because penetration
wasn't achieved.

When the court closed off
that avenue, the insanity plea
was entered. Smith wasn’t really
guilty because he was insane,
and he didn’t understand the
criminality of his act. In other
words, he knew he was doing
violence against two other
human beings, but he didn’t

shows how barren the legal
system is as a ground for con-
trolling and dealing with rapists.

This week I’m showing the
class films — one on a 1955
atomic bomb exploded and
filmed in Nevada as one part in
the long and continuing history
of military nuclear testing. It
depicts the devastation left by
just one atomic bomb, a bomb
minuscule by comparison to
present day thermonuclear devi-
ces. Houses built on the flat
open desert land were made of a
variety of materials — wood,
brick, reinforced concrete, etc.
Mannequins were positioned all
over the “set,” the scene of what
was soon to be a totally wrecked
real life-sized “toy” town. The
bomb is detonated, the blinding
flash of heat thousands of
degrees in all directions is
followed instantaneously by the
tremendous blast of the explo-
sion which obliterates homes
over a mile away.

We are reminded that this is
a small atomic bomb, and in the
wreckage we are shown among
other debris that the pattern on
the dress of one of the manne-
quins has curiously tattooed itself
onto the underclothes. The men
congratulate themselves over and
over, the music rises, the U.S.
emblem appears on the screen
and the film ends triumphantly.
One male student, a visitor from
another class, tells me that
seeing the film has changed his
whole attitude about nuclear
power and he could no longer be
in favor of it. I am wondering if
he will view the films I show
tomorrow.

Tomorrow I am showing
two films on the effects of
human life and property after
the August 6 bombing on
Hiroshima and the double bomb-
ing of the civilian populations of
Nagasaki three days later on
August 9, 1945. They are
gruesome films. I am not requir-
ing that any student sit through
more of the graphic realism than
they feel they can stomach. I am
not showing the films to be
gruesome; I am showing the
films because I feel that they need to
be shown. I feel that it is impor-
tant that each of us knows what
men with atomic and other
nuclear weapons have done to
other living human beings and what our
present day nuclear weapons are
capable of doing many times
over at any moment of any day.

In the beginning we are
shown the landscapes of Hiroshi-
ma and Nagasaki, areas that bear
a strong resemblance to our own
local geography. [in California]:
Then in an instant, not one
timber remains. In Nagasaki, a
totally gratuitous carnage in the
first place, we are told that
the bombs “missed” their intended
military installation target.
