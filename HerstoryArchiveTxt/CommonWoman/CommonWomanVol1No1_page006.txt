The Vermont Women’s Health

Center

— An Update

September 1st, 1978 will
mark the sixth anniversary of
the opening of the Vermont
Women’s Health Center, making
it the oldest and most visible

feminist institution in the
greater Burlington area.
Commonwoman has taken a

look at the current status of the
center, as the first in a series of
articles about organizations that
are by, for and about Vermont
women.

In the Spring of 1972, the
Vermont Supreme Court, in a
case called “Jacqueline R. vs.
State of Vermont,” dismissed
the archaic law that had made
abortion illegal. The state
legislature did not have time in
that session to pass a new law
concerning abortion, so a legal
vacuum was created. Various
groups around the Burlington
area realized the implications of
this lack of legislation, and
immediately began attempts to
make abortion available.

In June of 1972, a meeting
for all concerned citizens was
held and a board of directors
was elected and working
committees were established.
The long process of creating the
Vermont Women’s Health
Center had begun, utilizing the
tireless volunteer effort that
continued to mark its six year
existence. Women who were
involved from the outset recall
the spectacular effort made to
provide the most basic needs of
money, facilities, equipment,
doctors, staff and medical
policies. A local bank loan was
obtained and co-signed by seven
prominent community women.

Then there was the work
directed toward resolving
political differences among

members of the organization
who chose to become a working
collective. This structure has
continued to the present day
and is a process that has been
called especially rewarding,
although occasionally painful
and laborious. The center's
collective contains about twenty
local women at any given time
and provides employment as
well as participation in
non-traditional areas such as
business management.

When the Vermont Women’s

Health Center opened in
Colchester in September of
1972, it was one of the only
places in New England
performing abortions, without
complex legal tangles. This
placed a high demand on

pregnancy termination services
and so the establishment of
broad gynecological services had
to be initially delayed. However,
it was the original intent and it is
still the policy to provide
supportive, high quality,
inexpensive and general health
care to the women of Vermont.

The Colchester Clinic had
been in operation for two years,
when it was decided that more
space was needed due to
increased patient demand. A
downtown Burlington location
was preferable for easy access to
all community women and in
the Fall of 1974 the second

floor Bank Street location was
leased. The Vermont Women’s
Health Center blossomed there
and operated successfully from
October of 1974 until May of
1977, when the entire building
burned to the ground. Planned
Parenthood Administrative
offices, a restaurant and movie
theater were also destroyed.

re-open at their present location
of 336 North Avenue. The
circumstances surrounding this
choice of address are
complicated, but basically
revolve around finding a building
to purchase rather than lease. It
needed to be easily accessible to
the general community and
within a realistic price range as

The circumstances
surrounding the fire
were unresolved, but
the consequences for the health
center were immediate and
apparent. Not only had a
considerable psychological blow
been dealt to the Burlington
women’s community, but the
reality of the financial
devastation soon became clear.
It was estimated that $100,000
in equipment and facilities had
been lost, but that the insurance
would cover only $12,000. It
became apparent that planning
for such an eventuality had not

been thorough or complete
enough and so the painful
process of self-examination

began within the collective. In
addition, the business records,
patient records, and a compiled
herstory of clippings and
correspondence concerning the
center had been destroyed.

After the initial shock had
subsided, the women of the
collective as well as the

Burlington women’s community
began to plan for the re-opening
of the Vermont Women’s Health
Center. It was a long grueling
summer for those involved, and
although the financial burden
was great, only three of the
twenty staff members left the
collective during the month
before a new location could be
found. Throughout the summer
and fall, clinics were held twice a
week at the already
over-crowded offices of Planned
Parenthood. But no abortion
facilities were available and
referrals had to be made to
either the Southern Vermont
Women's Health Center in
Rutland or a private physician in
Morrisville.

It was a total of seven months
from May of 1977 to December
of 1977 before the Vermont
Women’s Health Center could

remain open again. All the financial
decisions, physical renovations,
and additions had to be
completed, and for the third
time the Burlington women’s
community rose to give
hundreds of free hours of labor

as well as financial and moral
support to the collective’s
efforts.

At present the clinic is
breaking even financially and is
building up the number of
patients it served before the May
1977 fire forced relocation.

Since 1976 when the sliding fee
scale went into effect, the health
center has subsidized $58,800
worth of free medicine.

A sample of the services
provided include gynecological

exams, pregnancy tests and
terminations, self-help
information, support, referrals
and counseling, alternative
healing information, female
sexuality information, VD
screening and treatment,
vaginitis treatment, nutrition
information, birth control

information, breast exams and
pap smears, sterilization
information, services for teenage
women and menopause
information. Patients are
encouraged to participate in the
health care process on all levels.

Eighty percent of the patients
seen at the Vermont Women’s
Health Center are from
Vermont. Their ages range from
eighteen to fifty years with
seventy-seven percent being
between eighteen and thirty.
Sixty-one percent are single,
twenty-five percent are married,
and the remainder separated,
widowed or divorced.
Approximately 4,000 patients
are seen each year.

In the pre-dawn hours of May
16th of this year, a Molotov
cocktail was thrown at the
patient entrance door of the

North Avenue clinic. The
explosion and resulting fire was
reported almost immediately by
a passerby, so the damage was
not as extensive as it might have
been.

When the first patient of the
morning arrived, clean-up and
investigative operations were
underway. Although the smell

of smoke and a feeling of
violence and paranoia still
permeated the building, the

woman chose to stay as did the
staff. Members of the collective
had gathered at the center earlier
in the morning and after the
initial shock and grief over the
damage and its intent had
passed, decided it was important
to stay open with “business as
usual.” Throughout the day and
following week, calls, telegrams
and letters of support poured
into the center from individuals,
feminist groups, and health
centers across the country.

As of this writing, the arson
investigation is all but officially
closed, with no suspects on file.
There is a $1,600 reward to go
to the individual who provides
information leading to an arrest
and conviction. $600 of the
reward has come from pledges to
the health center from
concerned individuals in the
community. An extensive new
security system has recently
been completed at considerable
expense to the center.

Although it is not known
what motivated the arsonist,
many individuals feel that it was
linked with a national
anti-choice group, who publicly
have planned to disrupt facilities
providing abortions. It had been
specified that the week before
and following Mother’s Day was
the target time. The Burlington
incident occurred the Tuesday
following Mother's Day. In the
past year, an increasing number
of women’s health care facilities
from Alaska to Virginia have
been firebombed, vandalized
and invaded.

In looking toward the future,
members of the collective
express optimism and
enthusiasm for the continued
growth of the Vermont Women’s
Health Center. Recently all staff
received a modest pay raise and
it is hoped that cost of living
increases can be maintained.
Many courses in women’s health
and related subjects are being
planned, along with extensive
outreach education. Legislative
issues concerning women and
women’s health care continue to
be focused on. A newsletter,
speakers’ bureau, and fund
raising event are in the planning
stages.

Pre-natal care, birthing and
post-natal care are directions in
which the collective would like
to move. At present, the health
center finds that regulations and
licensure surrounding such care

present an insurmountable legal

and financial barrier, but is
continuing to investigate a
variety of possibilities. As has

been the custom throughout its
existence, the Vermont Women’s
Health Center is continuing its

weekly in-service training to
keep staff members up to date
with advances in medicine and
counseling, as well as to
continue the clinic’s involvement
in the Women’s Movement.
Many members of the collective
are currently in training as
physicians’ assistants.

With an eye toward the
continued expansion of, and
support for, the Center, a
spokeswoman for the group
stated, “The guiding philosophy
at the Vermont Women’s Health
Center is that every woman has
the right and the responsibility
to make decisions regarding her
health. The staff provides
education and support. Each
woman is encouraged to share
her questions and concerns and
to have an active role in her
experience at the Center.”
