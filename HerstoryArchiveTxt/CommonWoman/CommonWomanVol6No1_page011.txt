FOR MEN WHO WANT TO KNOW

Somehow, somewhere

You got my priorities

Ass backwards.

You're all the time

Wanting to know

Why I hate men.

Hating men is not the point;

Loving women is

The full circle

Of my life.

So, if you want to know,

Please go ask straight men

Why they hate men

And won't sleep with them,
—Michiyo Cornell

ANCIENT SECRETS

I'll tell you what I want.

I want to remember the goddess, the goodness in me.

I insist.
We are rising in love... we two. Yes,
we are two.
By the goddess in each of us, I won't
forget that your gifts are yours to
give and only become mine once they
are freely given.
Each time you open your long, strong
arms to me, I am charged and changed.
“Time after tender time you've opened
your silky thighs to me, saying: ‘Swim
here, drink here if you wish,
if you dare.”
I dare... swimming timelessly as your
lively wetness slakes my thirst.

MARCIA’S POEM

Want,

To want,

To be in want.
Poor,

To be poor,
Poverty.

Lack of money

Means so many things.
First of all,

It meant no privacy,

No space of my own,

But a room

I shared with two sisters
And no corner of my soul
To myself.

It meant not being in style:

Clothes that didn’t fit quite right.

I wore a bright wool skirt
To school one day,

A boy laughed and asked me
If it came from a rag bag.
What could I say?

He wasn’t far from wrong.

What did you do on Jan. 15th

I took the day off from work

To celebrate and commemorate this man
I observed the day of his birth

It meant

(After six years of school)
Being invited

To Lucille’s house

Only to find

That she wanted

To give me clothes:

An object of charity
Instead of a friend.

In high school,
It meant no
Extracurricular activities

Except housework and homework.

I saved my lunch money

For college

At one dollar fifty per week

And somehow saved fifty dollars,
Only to have Dad “borrow” it
And I never saw the money again.

In college,

Being poor

Meant not going

Skiing or on vacation

Like my classmates.

Our college didn’t serve meals
On weekends;

The college said

Everybody went home on weekends.

WHAT DID YOU DO ON JAN. 15TH?

What did you do on Jan. 15th

Did you know it was a special day

A holiday for Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.
Jan. 15th was his birthday

Page 11

I wasn't everybody;

I didn’t count.

I had barely enough

To cover tuition and books,
So I went hungry

For four years

On college weekends.
Sometimes I ate leftover pizza
From the garbage,

And sometimes

Bought a candy bar

From the vending machine
Downstairs in my dorm,
But mostly I went hungry.

That's what being poor is,
Not laziness, not filth,
Not lack of character: 
It’s lack of money.
—Michiyo Cornell

What did you do on Jan. 15th

His murder caused many to mourn

So many positive things he tried to do
Nobody remembers... now that he’s gone

What did you do on Jan. 15th
You probably prayed for the warmth of Spring
Wonder if anyone will remember next year
to pray
Happy Birthday To Martin Luther King.....
—Gwen Shervington

And as you soothe me with your

magical mothering tongue...

And as you steadily rock me, sliding

your fingers over ancient secrets...
And as you show the fullness of your power, The

What did you do on Jan. 15th

Bet you didn’t know about it at all
Or either forgot or didn’t really care
Is his name one that you recall

pushing and straining in simple lust... Person:
I remember in the eye of this storm What did you do on Jan. 15th
what it is I want. Stops Did you remember this advocate for civil rights
to share our animal beauty. Loving He believed in fighting through peace and nonviolence
to share our wisest pleasures. and For this he was given the Nobel Peace Prize
to honor our separate nests. Stops
to know that whatever happens Needing What did you do on Jan. 15th
this is real and good. and Dr. King preached freedom for all people alike
—Joy Beaulieu Seeking He believed that we would all overcome someday
Love If the government did what was right
Will
Survive! What did you do on Jan. 15th

This man cried out for universal love
Wonder if he’s pleased with what he sees
As he looks down from up above
