NO FREEDOM  
FOR KRISTINA  

By Nancy Powell for the  
Kristina Berster Defense  
Committee  

Kristina Berster’s ordeal is  
far from over. Contrary to  
popular expectation, she was not  
released when her seven-month  
sentence for border violations  
was up, but was detained by the  
Immigration and Naturalization  

Service in the Metropolitan  
Correctional Center in New  
York City.  

Kristina was arrested on  

July 16, 1978, for attempting to  
illegally cross the U.S.-Canadian  
border at Alburg, Vt. Although  
they could never produce evi-  
dence beyond the fact that  
Kristina was a member of a  
university-funded alternative  
therapy group, some of whose  
members went on to more  
radical means of protest, the FBI  
persisted in calling her a terror-  
ist. The courts and INS have  
treated her accordingly, refusing  
to set bail for this “dangerous”  
woman. (Any woman who is  
not passive is seen as dangerous,  
on some level.)  

The double standard that  
operates in this country as to  
who will be granted political  
asylum is blatant. Solzhenitsyn,  
Ginsburg and other (male)  
Soviet dissidents whose pro-capital-  
ist defections make this coun-  
try look good are readily accept-  
ed, while left political activists  
are turned down.  

Hector Marroquin, a Mexi-  
can labor organizer who was also  
accused of “terrorism” (for an  
act which occurred while he was  
in a Texas hospital with a  
broken leg), was recently denied  
asylum and ordered out of the  
country, despite recognition on  
the part of INS officials of  
Mexican police brutality and  
torture. The INS condones the  
use of undocumented Chicanos  
by agribusiness, when they are  
needed to strike-break the Uni-  
ted Farm Workers. The compli-  
city of business and government  
is obvious; individual freedoms  
are laid to waste in the interest  
of our male capitalist managers.  

There is little or no chance  
that Kristina will ever be free in  
this country. She is not extra-  
dictable as the U.S.-German  
treaty now stands, but deporta-  
tion — which usually means  
being sent to a country other  
than your native one — is more  
and more likely. The Attorney  
General, Griffin Bell, who was  
instrumental in helping our  

“liberal” Ted Kennedy push the  
revised Federal Criminal Code  
through the Senate last year  
(S-6869), has the authority to  
order Kristina back to the  
Federal Republic of Germany.  
(NB: S-6869 would make  
demonstrating within 100 yards  
of a Federal courthouse and  
mailing abortion information  
through U.S. mails federal  
crimes.)  

Should Kristina be returned  
to Germany, she can be held  
indefinitely in pre-trial deten-  
tion. Other accused “terrorists”  
have spent up to three years in  
the barbarous solitary “white  
cells” — soundproofed, with  
constant fluorescent lighting,  
and no means of communication  
with the outside world. Keeping  
leftists, socialists, or anyone else  
who challenges the police state's  
power in such conditions effect-  
ively dampens people’s desire to  
seek even minimal change.  
According to German prison  
psychologists, this “sensory  
deprivation” destroys people  
mentally and physically.  

Germany and the U.S. have  
strong political and economic  
ties, connections of mutual  
benefit which involve both our  
diplomats and our multinational  
magnates. German technology is  
a main cornerstone of our own —  
see the section on gynecological  
practices in Gyn/Ecology,  
by Mary Daly. We must examine  
the deterioration of West Ger-  
man civil liberties and the  
growing police force there, and  
seek to understand the implica-  
tions for us. Kristina has been  
merely a pawn in the hands of  
the war-oriented politicians, a  
sign to all activists of what we  
can expect for our struggle.  

Kristina’s health has been  
damaged by her nine months in  
maximum security prison, and  
she is ambivalent about her  
future. The defense committee  
needs money badly. We also are  
asking people to donate stamps  
so that we can mail our informa-  

tion. Send money and 15 cent-  

postage stamps to:  
Kristina Berster Defense Committee  

Lastly, we urge women  
everywhere to educate them-  
selves about the patriarchal  
power structure, and to join  
with each other in taking power  
for themselves, so that we may  
one day (soon) control our  
bodies, lives, and destinies.  

Medusa Muzic  

Burlington area women will  
soon have the chance to listen  
and dance to an incredible,  
inspiring duo of women muzi-  
cians from Gainesville, Florida.  
Flash Silvermoon and Pandora  
Lightmoon joined their musical  
energies in New York City in  

and since then have  
toured the East Coast while  
making their home in Florida.  
Their music ranges from raunchy  
blues to more subtle jazz and  
classical pieces, all of it very  
together and moving.  

Flash composes and arran-  
ges most of Medusa’s music  
which has a strong, positive and  
clear feminist message. They  

own brand of  

women’s music  

coupled with inspiring lyrics. To  
their wide variety of  
styles, Medusa Muzic  
uses, with fabulous ability, a  
number of different instruments.  
Flash, a professional musician  
for 14 years, plays keyboards,  
guitar and drums and carries the  
lead vocals. Her piano playing  
will amaze you, I promise!  

Night  
Continued from Page 12  

Women’s faces looked happy —  
I felt happy as I felt our power.  
Familiar Holly Near songs  
resounded from the crowd as we  
progressed. At first it was some  
unorganized as we looked to  
each other with what song/chant  
to begin with. Others, further  
back could be heard singing  

“Hey, Unc Naw-Mujer,” a song,  

of political struggle in Chile and  
women who have “disappeared”  
whom it is believed the “authori-  
ties” know their whereabouts  
but aren’t telling. Another song  
of Holly's, “Fight Back,” could  
be heard in the growing momen-  
tum of the crowd — a song  
about taking back our power  
from those that would have us  
be afraid — together we can  

make a safe home is the ending  
line of this song. The braver of  
us sang out “Castrate Rapists”  
and “Curfew the Men” to some  
boys who had gathered on the  
sidewalks in front of Burling-  
ton’s well-known bar scene.  
They were heckling us and  
thrusting their frothy mugs of  
beer our way. Others joined and  
that felt good. Windows opened  
and hands popped out as we  
proceeded by. Not a common  
scene. It is a long way to march,  
especially with a child and  
chanting at the top of your lungs  
and I had doubts I would  
complete the circle from UVM  
and back again. However,  
I found my energy only increasing  
as we walked and having a  
constant wish that this could  
happen more than once a year.  
It can; I've heard like wishes  
from other women. My energy  
was also renewed from the  
common knowledge that women  

in all parts of this country where  
there is a growing awareness of  

our struggle to be free were  
marching this same evening.  

Our march came to an end  
as we climbed UVM hill to the  
campus green in front of the  
Chapel. Full circle. And one we  
made also as all of us that had  
completed the “tour” held  
hands and stretched for what  
seemed like a mile. It was a good  
way to finish.  

As people were breaking up  
and beginning to leave or come  
together with women in smaller  
circles — one woman’s voice rang  
out over all the others, saying:  

“If you ever see a woman  
looking like she is being hassled  
by one man or a group of men,  
get involved. Don’t wait, pass  
by, or pretend not to feel for  
what she is feeling. Ask yourself  
what could I do in this situa-  
tion? This is the way we can  
begin to take back the night.”

Pandora plays flute, sax,  
and a wailing harmonica as well  
as providing backup vocals and  
light percussion. She magnetizes  
many who watch her as she  
nimbly shifts from instrument to  
instrument, sometimes midsong,  
to provide the variety of sound  
that characterizes a Medusa  
Muzic performance.  

I watched and listened to  
these women play while I was in  
Florida last winter and I find my  
lack of words to describe how  
moved I was frustrating. The  
original music is totally ours;  
strong, proud, often ecstatic, or  
angry, always clearly aware of  
our culture, heritage, and  
dreams as women who are  
celebrating and creating a new  
way to be.  

Medusa Muzic has played  
for nearly a hundred women’s  
concert and dance gatherings up  
and down the East Coast and  
southwest, and they are on tour  
now. Later this summer they  
plan to play at the Michigan  
Womyns’ Music Festival. They  
have played joint concerts with  

Kristina Berster  

Berkeley Women's Music Col-  
lective and Casse Culver. And  
they invite any of the local  
Burlington area women musi-  
cians to join them when they  
play here toward the end of  
their second set (so bring your  
instrument).  

Keep the night, Sunday  
June 17, open, and plan to share  
in this musical gathering and  
community celebration. Tickets  
are $3 and are available in  
advance from Bookstacks, Vt.  
Womyns’ Health Center, and  
some local women. The concert  
(first set is sit down concert  
format, second set will also have  
dancing space) will begin at 8  
p.m. at The Mill in Winooski.  
Please buy your ticket in ad-  
vance and come on time on  
Sunday the 17th. Childcare will  
be available, bring the children  
with you to the Mill and they'll  
go to childcare from there. I  
want to encourage all women  
reading the Commonwoman to  
come and bring your friends —  
don’t let this event slide by you.
