A NEW VIEW....

Book Review — A New
View of a Woman’s Body
by the Federation of
Feminist Women's Health
Centers. (Simon & Schuster,
$8.95).

A New View seeks to empower
women by giving health information
so we can avoid unnecessary doctor
visits and can get respect and complete
care when we deal with the medical
establishment. Unfortunately, the
book falls short of this goal, and in fact
contributes to the mystification of
our bodies through the presentation
of information that is misleading,
incomplete, and confusing.

A graphic example is that the Feminist
Women's Health Centers (FWHCs) redefined
the clitoris. The authors claim
that the clitoris is not the
“little bump” we all thought it
was, but that it includes every
structure of the genito-urinary
system (except the kidneys). A

“clitoris” includes the ovaries, tubes,
uterus, bladder, anus, etc. If I
went to a health facility and said
I thought I had hemorrhoids in
my clitoris, I’m apt to lose
whatever credibility I had, rather
than to be empowered by this
redefinition. While I support the
principle of refuting traditional
medical ways of labeling and
instead opting for terms that are
more accurate and respectful, there exists a danger in that this
redefinition assumes an effect on
the medical community that the
FWHCs do not have. I doubt
that this book will inspire
universal acceptance of the
FWHCs redefinition.
What galls me the most
about this new view of the
clitoris is that it is compared in
the text and by illustration to
the penis. I am angry that
feminists would buy into the
“bigger is better” comparison
trip that is portrayed here. The
comparative description of the
erect glans and shaft of the
penis and clitoris struck me as
apologetic and unnecessarily
phallic.

Despite my argument with
this information, I rather liked
the chapter on menstrual extrac-
tion (removal of menstrual flow
by gentle suction). It took
courage to print this chapter.
The authors trace the herstory
and describe the purpose of ME,
and discuss MEs done to remove
menstrual flow vs. MEs done in
pregnancy. At a time when
the legality of abortion is
threatened, the FWHCs are
admirably upfront about dis-
cussing ME and encouraging
women to learn how to do them
in their own homes.

The outstanding feature of
the book was its photo series of
the vulva and clitoris. The
photographs cleanly and beauti-
fully show the differences and
similarities in women’s vulvas
and cervixes. Except for the
pictures of the cervix, the
captions were mostly extraneous
or uninformative, and in one
case, the caption was insulting.
This particular photo was cap-
tioned, “This Asian woman has
very little pubic hair...” I found
this offensive and racist particu-
larly since all other captions
were written from a menstrual
cycle or pregnancy herstory
perspective without reference to
race.

Visually, I found the book
pleasing. The print is easy to
read, and the photos and illus-
trations are for the most part
exquisite. Women of different
shapes, sizes, and races were
portrayed in the book, although
there didn’t seem to be much of
an age range depicted (mostly
young women). The book’s tone
is decidedly heterosexual,
although references were made
to health care for lesbians and
celibate women. The book is
expensive ($8.95) so I would
suggest looking at it closely
before purchase.

Overall, A New View irks
me. There's a dilemma in criti-
cizing a book about self-help
that seeks to empower us and
celebrate our bodies. There
is not enough information given
to really help us make informed
decisions about our own health
or to advocate for each other.
While the goal to become self
helpers is one I believe in, I
think the FWHCs have used this
book as a front to make money
and as a political tool to blow
their own horns. Their book is
not a “new view” of anything,
but in part a desperate attempt
to appear innovative and pio-
neering within the realm of the
feminist and health movements.

This Bridge Called My Back
is a collection of writings by
twenty-nine wimmin of color.
The book is edited by Cherrie
Moraga and Gloria Anzaldúa,
two Chicana feminists, who after
years of encountering racism
from white feminists, decided to
put together a book as a reaction
to that racism, and as an un-
yielding definition of feminism
by wimmin of color in the
United States. The wimmin who
contributed to Bridge are of
varied and diversified back-
grounds: some well-to-do, some
not; some lesbian, some not;
some from inner cities, others
from the sticks. Each Sister has a
different story to tell, different
pains, different personal experi-
ences. Yet whether the writer is
Chicana or Asian or Indian or
Black, the same message comes
across. A message that speaks of
the dilemmas faced by Black
wimmin.
Assimilation/Alienation is
one of these dilemmas. The
words are written together
because for a Black woman, they
exist as one. When she assimi-
lates, she becomes alienated
from her people’s culture; when
she doesn’t assimilate, she
becomes alienated from the
white world. Alienation becomes
ever present in the life of a
non-white woman, whether she
assimilates or not. We, all
non-Anglo wimmin and Anglo
wimmin alike have a need,
a basic human need, to belong...
to fit in, be normal... pass.
Nobody wants or likes to be
different. Bridge speaks on the
problems, uncertainties, and hurts
faced by wimmin of color
because of Assimilation/Alienation.

The wimmin of Bridge also
talk about what they feel to be
the major political concerns for
Black wimmin in the U.S.:

(1) how visibility/invisibility
as women of color forms our
radicalism; (2) the ways in which
Third World women derive a
feminist political theory specifi-
cally from our racial/cultural
background and experience; (3)
the destructive and demoralizing
effects of racism in the women’s
movement; (4) the cultural,
class, and sexuality differences
that divide women of color; (5)
Third World women’s writing as
a tool for self-preservation and
revolution; and (6) the ways and
means of a Third World feminist
future.

This Bridge Called My Back
is a book that should be read by
all people. The white woman
and man who have not acknow-
ledged and dealt with their
racism should read it. Any man
who has not acknowledged and
dealt with his sexism should read
it. Any woman who feels that
racism is not a problem within
the women’s movement should
read it. It should be read by
anyone and everyone with a
mind open enough to hear what
the women are saying. Not all
books are written to be under-
stood by all people; some books,
like Bridge, are written so that
people might make their own
individual effort to learn and
understand.

This book should especially
be read by women of color.
Black women have needed some-
thing to help awaken, acknow-
ledge, and identify those feelings
expressed by the women in
their writings. The experiences
of the twenty-nine women are
personally unique to each of
them, but universally unique in
the sense that all Black women
experience racism, sexism, and
alienation. If more women of
color read Bridge, perhaps our
alienation wouldn't be so great.
Perhaps we'd realize that there
are Sisters all over the U.S.
struggling to be seen/heard as
viable human beings. The women
of Bridge have put down on
paper what so many Black
women have felt for years but
had no way to express it. To
Gloria and Cherrie, whose dream
became a reality, and to the
other writers, I say Thank you.
This book was ‘long overdue.”
