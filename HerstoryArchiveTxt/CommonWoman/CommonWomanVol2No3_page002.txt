ent. Is it desirable for feminists

NEXT ISSUE,

The feminist and holistic health communities are each
becoming stronger and more visible in the Burlington area. 

Both of these movements offer
alternatives to the competitive,
impersonal, individualistic lifestyles that are associated
with “the establishment.” Yet

Commonwoman invites
your response to these questions. We will devote a section of
our next issue to this topic.
Please limit your article to 500
words and send it to us by May
29. (Commonwoman, Box 242,

Letters to the Editors

CMEN AGAINST RAPE

To the Commonwoman Editors,

So Lynn Vera is “sick of it,
totally tired and sick of it.”
Well, so am I.

I'm tired of feeling backed
into a corner and sometimes
defending myself against the
likes of Ms. Vera. I'm tired of
feeling like she is my enemy and
vice versa, as I think that we
both know who and what the
real enemy is. And I’m quite fed
up with being told what to do
and how to be in such an unfriendly manner.

Lynn Vera stated in her
letter that she “doesn't want to
hear any more of the ‘gentle,
alternative, feminist men’ until
they take some risks to educate
their ignorant sex...” I suspect
that it has been hard for her to
hear the truth from some of her
sisters that some of us are not
the devils that she has conveniently made us all out to be. I
suggest that her generalization
about my gender represents an
overreaction to a sexual/political
situation that is, in fact, so
despicable that it is hard to
overreact to.

As to the alleged incident at
the No Nukes benefit, I must
confess that I missed it. I heard
her announcement, but was not
aware of any change in the noise
level of the crowd. I heard
several people, men and women,
make comments to those around
them, but these were not snickers,
but rather positive words
about the idea of a Men Against
Rape group. Sexism, as well as
beauty, can sometimes be more
in the eyes of the beholder.

In closing, I ask that Ms.
Vera not close her eyes any
longer if she truly wants to see
men taking risks. For some of
us, living in John Wayne’s
shadow has not been easy. Not
all of us have accepted the
privilege of being the oppressor
of another gender, or for that
matter another class. The oppression of men in this society
needs to be given more than lip
service, not for the sake of
creating a Most Oppressed
Award, but to help to clarify
who's on whose side. This
recognition is especially important if one intends to castigate
or inspire us on towards greater
goals.

Most of my own “feminist”
consciousness has, not surprisingly, been nurtured by women
(I suppose those individuals
would now be suspect) who
were willing and able to see
where I was coming from and
what I’m trying to do (be). I’d
like to think that I've been able
to return the favor to some of
them, as well as to some male
friends, in the seemingly endless
quest to rid ourselves of sexism.
This has to be done in a spirit of
love and understanding, which
is, admittedly, easier said than
done. If you really care, Lynn, I
hope you'll give it a try.

Jed Lowy

Williston, VT.

In Response to Jed Lowy:
Sexism, like any oppression,
is more real and clear to the
oppressed. It may well be, as Jed
Lowy righteously preaches,
“more in the eyes of the beholder,” and that is a major part of
the problem. Until men who
consider themselves “aware” can
hear my anger, validate my
oppression, and own their own
role in perpetuating it (either
actively or passively), then it will
probably continue to be women
who are most affected by sexist
behavior and attitudes and therefore more perceptive of it.
For J.L. to deny that the
snide comments and jokes (that
I both saw and heard) happened,
rather than to first question
himself about why he was not
sensitive enough to be aware of
them, is in itself incriminating.
J.L. chooses to feel “backed into
a corner” and defensive in
reaction to my letter (and
others) — he could also have
chosen to validate my experience,
and use it to stimulate some productive scrutiny of
himself and/or his friends.

As for “who’s on whose
side” and who is the “real
enemy,” I feel strongly that as
long as “alternative men” are
not actively, and as a priority,
fighting sexism in and around
them, then they are about as
close to “the other side” as
anyone. To actively fight sexism,
one must look for it, expect it
even, and confront it. I’m not
sure, Jed Lowy, that we both do
know “who and what the real
enemy is.” While you choose to
set yourself up as the unappreciated feminist man, and respond to strong statements by
women by personally defending
yourself and/or attacking that
woman, then I consider you to
be fighting a different struggle
than I.

I never denied that there are
political, aware men whose work
I support — my criticism of
those men’s passive behavior as
regards educating their brothers
still stands; yes, there is still
more work for them to do. I
think that the men who could
read my last letter about the
benefit incident and respond
with self-scrutiny rather than
righteous anger, are the men I
will support, respect, and work
with on some issues. I am
more and more convinced that
Jed Lowy is not one of these
men — yet, Jed, I too hope
you'll give it a try.
Lynn Vera
Colchester

Dear Commonwoman,

On behalf of Burlington’s
Men Against Rape organization,
I wish to publicly thank Lynn
M. Vera (Letters, March issue)
for having made (apparently) the
first public announcement of
our group’s existence. Admittedly,
we should have done it
ourselves, but quite frankly,
we're a bit new at this activity
(fighting rape) and overly cautious.

Although we share a com-
mon abhorrence of rape, we've
discovered that we also share a
common ignorance of our own
brainwashing. So we've had to
spend our first few weeks getting
to know ourselves and learning
to trust each other. As you
women know (because you
started first) this step takes time.

We haven't yet finished that
first step, but we've decided to
come out of the closet anyway.
Our first public meeting was
held on Thursday, April 26, at
7:30 p.m., at St. Paul’s Cathedral in Burlington.

Our main purpose is educa-
tional; we hope to attack the
roots of rape by working with
men — especially young men —
and helping them to change
sexist attitudes and expectations. Some of us also want to
provide supportive counseling
for (male) partners of rape

From the Collective

Hello all of you out there
who just love annual meetings!
You know — the Rose Garden
annual meeting, the annual dow-
sers’ meeting, the veterans of
Sunday morning basketball
games on North St. annual
meeting?

Well, Commonwoman is
holding its first annual meeting
on Thursday, May 31, 7:30 p.m.
at St. Paul’s Cathedral. And you
can come and participate in
history in the making.

Commonwoman has come
full circle. Our collective has
been meeting and working together now for one year. We've put
out seven issues of this paper.
We all feel that it is time to
make a report to the greater
Burlington community and to
give us all a chance to sit and
talk.

Many issues which we as a
collective have talked about in
our letters from the collective
remain unresolved. Some of the
larger issues are centered around
the purpose of our paper in
terms of who we are reaching
and which stories we go after,
print, or choose not to print.
We have had proposals to change
our advertising policy and form
a smaller paid group to put out
our paper; to change our format
and become more of a newsletter; we have had criticisms
from readers who feel we
sometimes read like a paper for a
small in-group; our finances are
not as rosy as they were after
our first three issues; we are
reevaluating the energy it takes
to try and distribute outside
of the Burlington area.

Despite these problems,
Commonwoman feels strong
and alive to us. We are unique in
this state. The regular press
largely ignores women’s issues
(except for an occasional women’s lib joke) and certainly
provides no open forum for
women to share the visions in
their hearts and minds. In fact,
the regular press has little
understanding of the important
issues which unite and divide us
at every turn.

Women in Vermont have a
medium with which to speak to
each other. The women who
work on Commonwoman had
that vision from the start. Are
we fulfilling that need? If you
don’t think so, come to our
annual meeting and let us know
why not. If you do think so,
come and tell us so...
