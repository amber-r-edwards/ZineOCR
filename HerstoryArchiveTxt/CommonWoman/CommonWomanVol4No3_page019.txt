search for “commie terrorists”
both at home and abroad. This
scenario reads like a litany of
death to our people; and to
struggling, working people
around the world.

Perhaps the most blatant
current example is in El Salvador.
There the ruling government or
junta, bankrolled and “advised”
by the United States, is conducting
a “peasant pacification program”
modeled almost exactly on the one
that failed in Vietnam, and as part
of which napalm (a jelly-type
substance which coats the skin and
burns) is used against the peasants,
and an average of about 50 people a
day are killed by the government.
Without money from the United
States government — our money —
this horror could not continue. Already
so far, our government has given the
government of El Salvador 100
million dollars to “pacify” its
people. Meanwhile we — working
people in the U.S. — must tighten
our belts as essential programs are
cut and the U.S. military gets a huge
boost. Save whose economy? How?
Are we truly powerless?

Yvan Escobar of the El
Salvadorian Human Rights Com-
mission spoke recently in Bur-
lington. He reminds us that we,
the progressive people of the
United States, have an important

job to do to aid the struggle of
the Salvadorian people. The
people of El Salvador are resist-
ing directly, using guns and
political education against their
repressive government. That is
their job, they are doing it and
they are not going to stop until
they have won. We must resist as
they resist and we must support
their resistance by making our
government end all military aid
to the Salvadorian regime. The
struggle is one. The courage and
sure-footedness of the Salvador-
ian resistance will bring us
strength, and our resistance
will re-inspire them.

We do live in the belly of
the beast. From here, sometimes
it is hard to remember we're part
of an international people’s
struggle. From here, also, we're
in a good position to deliver
some devastating deathblows.

One of the most powerful
weapons used against us is the
isolation we experience — an
isolation that is consciously
cultivated by the ruling class and
its media. Once we see ourselves
as part of a widespread people's
struggle, once we break down
our isolation and open commu-
nication with those struggling
alongside us, around the world;
then we will know our own
strength. Look outward. We are
not alone.

From 1964 to 1972, the
wealthiest and most powerful
nation in the history of the
world made a maximum military
effort, with everything short of
atomic bombs, to defeat a
nationalist revolutionary move-
ment in a tiny, peasant country
— and failed. When the United
States fought in Vietnam, it was
organized modern technology
versus organized human beings,
and the human beings won. (A
