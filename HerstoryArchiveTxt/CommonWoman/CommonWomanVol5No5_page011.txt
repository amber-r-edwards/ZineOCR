Awake

Restless, unable to sleep  
although it is early morning  
Blood, I am bleeding  

The circle starts again  

I feel so sad  

it’s early  

and I want to sleep  

Restless  

Tired  

Vulnerable  

A woman bleeding  

How many women  

right now  

are bleeding with the moon?  
How many women are up now  
cooking baby and daddy’s breakfast  
bleeding?  

How many women are sleeping  
in their man’s arms  

bleeding?  

What does it mean?  

Why can't I sleep?  

I miss my old lover tonight  
only because he treated me like a child  
the openness of expression  

no gates  

no great defenses  

I loved him  

because I could crawl  

into his arms  

the way I would crawl  

into my mother’s lap.  
Now, I have finally stopped  
wanting  

that  

The here alone  

bleeding  

I have grown so much inside  

I don’t even feel small  

Maybe it’s not growth  

just awakening  

My mother had me in tears this morning  
I couldn’t stand to see her  
serving everyone  

yet I couldn’t bring myself  

to help her  

She is so beautiful  
someday she'll die  

and I can’t stand to think  
of how many years  
I hated her  
when she’s loved me  
even before she forced me  
out of her womb  
It’s so good to feel  
I am taking off my mask  
I am cleaning off  
layers of sticky make-up  
with cool cold cream  
I’m lying under a window  
that is pouring air onto my body  
Tears can fall  
again  
I have gotten  
off the bright stage  
My body is singing in release  
I am opening the doors  
and pulling open the bars  
letting the rain in  
and I’m bleeding  
streams of blood  
down to the sea  
of my soul.

Ode to an Asian Amazon  

I could feel your strength when I first held you  

When I first kissed you, I found the warm softness beneath  
the shield of survival  

I looked into you: dark slanted eyes and saw your pain  

The years of mockery, isolation, verbal and physical abuse  

I felt anger and rage at the people who hurt you  

But there was nothing I could do except hold you  

So I held you, listened to you, and.......  

And when you held me tight, I could feel your need to love  
and be loved for who you are.  

And I do love you  
You are my lover, my roommate, my sister, and my best friend  
We have similar backgrounds, and we share the same hurts and  
injustices as Third World women  
I support you in your struggle to educate the ignorant to the  
racism in the world  

And I do love you  

The Green Room  
for my mother Dolores  

And what color did you paint  
over drab grey?  
Periwinkle skies; earthy ambers and buff...  

When I wanted something just so  
you created finery  

plucked from my dreams  

like fantastic gourds from the vine.  
The haunted house costume  

for Halloween — a refrigerator box;  
corrugated sills under holes lit up  
yellow as pumpkin-eyes.  
Spiderwebs and window cracks  
delicately drawn with India Ink  

knowledge  

waiting for the right moment  

I sat by the bed and remembered  

all those other times and places  
friends parents lovers  

when their shuttered eyes slid away  
from any grief too plain  

hesitant words stumbled slowly  

on the cellophane plate glass. into the nightmare — slow silence  
We were happy I could never find my way  
a moon and witch impaled high among the sinking pauses  

waves of effort ran up my throat  
unable to push that day’s particular truth  
out into the room naked  

on coat hangers,  
Theatrical banners are blood red.  

I hated you for being weak  

to marry and give your life to him and us...  
Love seared my heart;  

resentment dripped acid  

in the convolutions of my brain——  

your room was lime green  

full of bright light  
the strained wheeze of each breath  
the faint hiss of oxygen  

pale hands pale face dead hair  

the poems you wrote for secret sisters spoke clearly;  
the black cats and bats say something anything  
the dummies stuffed with nylons before all words fall short  

in likenesses that had already stuffed us shiny smooth in nylons  
saw you as a mask...  

We always touched  

from behind clown-white.  

Our bladed carpet  

grows filamentous roots  

and this night  

is black  

to hide our flags.  

Skeletons in closets you always  
wore black and white  

because we don’t know how  

to see it that way.  

So Green Rooms  

are for waiting  

in costume  

to perform.  

Let’s bring the house down.

You Made Me  
I didn’t want to...  

I didn’t want to  
know your words  
so long  
meaningless  

I didn’t want to  
read the stories  
the untold truths  

I didn’t want to  
be like you  

But you made me.  

You made me know  
the words, the tales  
the ways of your kind  
You made me learn the  
things I didn’t want to  
learn  

& after all these years  
I’m made to see the  
ignorance you chose  

The choiceless paths you walk  
with death at your feet.  

I didn’t want to know  

But you continuously force me  

to see  

to feel  

to hate  

the way of your kind  

I didn’t want to learn  

to write your way  

So that you may comprehend  
the things I say  

I didn’t want to learn  
your language  
But you made me  

I didn’t want to know your way  

to see the pain  
to feel the hurt  
(the anger that I feel)  

Yes, I am angry at you  
for making me learn  
the ignorance of your way.  

—Consuelo Quinones  

We've Met “Before”  

We speak of other times and places  
Of other days and other faces  

Were we there? do we remember?  
Those heated days in late September...  

We close our eyes and return in time  
To other lives that cross our mind  
Were we lovers or were we friends  
We cannot tell, the fog descends  

As we return to days we know  

I feel, bonded to your spirit glow  
Though we'll never know the how or why  
We understand it’s never just goodbye
