THE GLO  

The women who gathered at  
Barnard College for the Global  
Feminist Disarmament Confer-  
ence the day before the dis-  
armament rally on June 12th  
were imbued with a special kind  
of light. Coming from the U.S.  
and 11 different countries (with  
more invited — but refused visas  
by the U.S. government — from  
the Soviet Union, East Germany,  
Canada, Jamaica, Denmark and  
Finland) we knew that the  
interconnections that we had  
made as feminists between the  
mutually reinforcing relationship  
of militarism and sexism in  
maintaining the arms race  
needed to be brought more  
effectively into disarmament  
work. We were looking forward  
simply to being together and  
sharing ideas.  

Sponsored by the American  
Friends Service Committee and  
the Women’s International Lea-  
gue for Peace and Freedom, the  
Conference started with Charlotte  
Bunch giving the opening  
address. The emphasis of  
Bunch’s speech was on the  
necessity of feminism’s becom-  
ing a global movement and an  
essential part of any movement  
which hopes to prevent nuclear  
destruction.  

She read a definition of the  
long-term goals of feminism as  
transformational politics, writ-  
ten by a group of feminists at a  
conference in Bangkok. It read:  

“Feminism is the achievement  
of women’s equality, dignity and  
freedom of choice through gain-  
ing women’s power to control  
our lives and our bodies both  
within and outside of the house.  
It is the removal of all forms of  
inequality and oppression  
through the creation of a more  
just social and economic order  
nationally and internationally.”  
Bunch said that we are on a  
precipice now where conquest,  

violence, fear and hatred are the  

commonly used solutions to all  
problems, “Feminism is a crucial  
part of the need to develop a  
new framework, a new perspec-  
tive on life, that we need if we  
are going to alter the patriarchal  
dyad of militarism, of  
corporate domination and the  
destruction of the earth's resour-  
ces we face today.”  

The connections between  
the everyday lives of women, the  
draining of the world’s resources  
and the complex need to be expounded  
upon by feminists, she concluded.  

These interconnections were  
emphasized in a workshop I  
took part in in the afternoon on  
feminism and the third world.  
Several women reported on a  
phenomenon I had been unaware  
of; the increase in forced prosti-  
tution — forced through the lack  
of economic alternatives — in  

Southeast Asia. Many Asian  

women are prepared for the  
job by being hired by  

multinational electronics firms for micro-  
chip work — which  

involves peering  
through a micro-  

scope &  
hours a  

day. Dumped five or ten years  
later when their eyes give out  
(there are no unions or disability  
payments in these countries),  
they find they can’t return to  
their villages, and almost the  
only option open to them is to  
sexually service the international  
business community (almost  
entirely male) and American  
servicemen who have been float-  
ing around the Indian Ocean in  
increasing numbers in recent  
years. Thus, corporate expansion  
in the third world and the  
military show of force that  
props it up have a very definite  
connection to the increasingly  
demeaned role of third world  
women.  
Another workshop reported  
on by the correspondent of Off  

Our Backs was on Lesbians in  
Discussion centered on the invisibility  
and heterosexism that les-  
bians feel in both women-only  
and mixed groups in the Peace  
movement. The women present  
expressed a general feeling of  
frustration, weariness and anger  
at giving energy to a movement  
which either ignored them or  
kicked them in the face. The  
oppressiveness of the ‘for our  
children” argument for women’s  
involvement was also discussed.  

Perhaps the most moving  
moment of the Conference came  
at the end when Argentinian and  
Irish women, with arms linked  
together, read a statement  
against the actions of their  
governments (this was during the  
height of the Falklands War).  
They concluded:  

...We mourn for all of us in  
Britain, Argentina and the world  
who suffer the effects of living  
under militaristic governments,  
governments that use war to  
distract from the violence and  

misery of unemployment, hun-  

ger, disease and death.  

We recognize that all these  
things are closely connected and  

Page 15  

we are very touched that we have  

had the opportunity of meeting  
all you lovely people who are  
suffering as we are from the crazi-  
ness of men. Us women, we  
weep together. There are no  
winners in this war or any war.  
As women we will struggle  
together to create a feminist  
society in which such problems  
cannot happen.  

After this speech there was  
scarcely a dry eye in the house.  
The mood produced by this  
statement was made especially  
poignant for me in the comment  
by an older WILPF woman as we  
left the Conference. “This sort  
of thing happened during all the  
Wars — you should have seen the  
American and German women before World  
War I and II.”  

Her comment was the final  

confirmation that although we  
may need to cry on each other's  
shoulders when we can’t make  
sense of the madness, we have  
to do far far more to stop the  
current preparations for nuclear  
war.

of Off Our Backs for the

speech.  

Continued from page 17  

They call us paranoid, schizo-  
phrenic, crazy and they put us  
in jail where they drug us and  
they torture us and they RAPE  
and kill us.  

We answer we are mad  
strong willful women, and we  
see and name this culture of  
death, greed and destruction  
threatening to overcome us for  
the evil it truly is. And we are,  
angry. And we are sad. And we  
are extricating ourselves from its  
stranglehold. And we are ex-  
pressing our righteous rage and  
overwhelming sorrow whenever  

we hear of and experience the  
cruelties of mankind. And we  
are wailing because our sister in  
El Salvador had her pregnant,  
life-giving, life-sustaining — belly  
ripped open — her child torn  
from her womb and hacked into  
pieces before her dying eyes. We  
will not let the patriarchy  
continue. We are the resistance.  
They call us pushers and put  

us in jail.  
We answer we are healers  
providing ourselves and our  

sisters with the medicine we  
need to objectively see and  

destroy the patriarchy.  

They call us addicts and  
they put us in jail.  

We answer we are women  
becoming aware of the many  
addictions and the resultant  
mindlessness imposed upon us  
by the patriarchy and we are  
deciding for ourselves what  
medicines we will use.  

They call us disorganized,  
well-meaning nuisances and put  
us in jail.  

We answer we are well-  
organized, informed, caring women  
committed to living our  

lives outside of this death  
worshipping culture called civi-  
lization. The patriarchy is our  
avowed enemy and we are going  
to destroy it with our process  
and our witchy ways. We are  
strong, life-conscious women  
struggling with our sisters,  
lovers, daughters, mothers to  
assure the continuation of life.  
Sometimes, though, we  
believe what they tell us we are  
and we forget who we really are  
and we end up supporting them  
and denying ourselves. We must  
name ourselves carefully and not  

allow them to define us. We  
know who we really are and we  
claim our identity with joy and  
pride and strength.
