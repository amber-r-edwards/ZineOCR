TY DIRECT ACTION RESISTANCE FIGHT BACK

I need to begin by saying
that this is my personal history
with nonviolence, and it is not
textbook theory, although I
don’t think that there is any
textbook theory really. We are
taking action and turning it into
theory all the time.

Nonviolence is a respect for
life. It is a system of values
which include freedom, equality,
peace, love, and humanization.
These words get thrown around
a lot so that it is necessary to
define them. They get defined
both for myself and in resistance
to the patriarchy. There was a
Doonesbury cartoon where there
was a U.N. resolution being read
that said “peace is good” and
one third world nation said
“don't you see that is just a
code word for suppressing peo-
ple’s movements and paving the
way for economic transnational
corporate exploitation.” We
can’t be bought anymore by the
patriarchy’s use of words like
peace and freedom. They use
them to manipulate us emotion-
ally so that we will silently let
them have their way.

I value freedom and feel like
we each have to really think
about what that means to us.
For me, freedom is the right to
live, which includes adequate
food, shelter, clothing, basic
survival, and the freedom of the
human spirit. Freedom means
that we live our lives in a way
that we are not oppressive or
oppressed, exploited or exploit-
ing, that our freedom is not
gained by stepping on someone
else’s back or by being stepped
on.

I am interested in revolu-
tion. I want a revolution, but I
don’t want a revolution that
replaces one rule with another. I
want a revolution of the self. I
want each individual to no
longer give up their power to a
ruling class or to become a part
of a ruling class, but to rule
themselves. By resisting rule I
am acting nonviolently. Non-
violence as a personal lifestyle is
the only lifestyle that allows me
to be treated as I would like to
be treated, with love and
respect; basically, nonviolence
allows me to be treated
humanely. Violence is dehuman-
izing, stupid, and immature,
while nonviolence gives me
unlimited options. We do not
live in a vacuum or in a homo-
genous world. We have differ-
ences. A nonviolent lifestyle
does not allow for separatism.
For me, separatism is important.
It is a balancing, an equalizing
like yin and yang, but it is not
the balance. If I am constantly
dealing with a group as the
oppressor, I am denying them
their humanity. That gives any
group that views me as the
oppressor the right to deny me
my humanity, my option to
change. Separatism refuses to
recognize the individual and
condemns the individual to a
group fate. Nonviolence is recog-
nizing in ourselves both the
oppressor and the oppressed and
working to change that. It is
freeing, and freedom is the basic
right and impetus behind every
social movement such as femi-
nism, third world liberation, and
guerilla movements.

My personal journey
through nonviolence has been
that first I said, “oh wow, of
course, at last, the way,” then I
said, “no, there are excep-
tions.” There were, and still are
people around who I think the
world would be better off
without (like Pinochet, Videla,
Somoza, Hitler, Idi Amin,
Albert, Duarte, the Shah) and I
need to justify within my
personal commitment to free-
dom and humanity, guerilla
revolutions that use guns, bombs,
and weapons. Similarly, I need
to justify women’s use of force
against their rapists and batter-
ers. I don’t think my justifica-
tion would hold water as pure
nonviolent resistance theory, but
I think it holds water in terms of
freedom and humanity being the
primary goal of revolution. I
think for a revolution to be
successful it must adopt non-
violence as an integrated person-
al stance. I think nonviolent
strategy used properly is the
most humanizing political stra-
tegy. I think that guerilla revolu-
tions (while not employing non-
violence as a political strategy)
adopt the basic tenets of non-
violence; a respect for life,
freedom, and humanity as their
personal spirit. I think this must
be so because I can’t see how
guerilla movements could work
otherwise. They depend on the
goodwill of the population for
their safety and their very lives.
They make a practice of treating
the peasants as people and not as
spoils of war to be raped, robbed,
and made into trophies. Guerilla
movements derive their strength
from treating the peasants as
people. The oppression they are
resisting is so extreme. If you are
being stepped on it is hard not
to notice. I believe nonviolence
is present if the approach is one
of love and support rather than
fear and coercion.

I think this is a place for me
to make the connection between
third world guerilla movements
and feminism. Both movements’
ultimate goals are freedom,
equality, humanity. We in the
first world have some basic
rights that don't exist in repres-
sive regimes. We don’t have
thousands of desaparacedos, but
we are threatened by the insane
military buildup and the corres-
ponding human needs that go
unmet as our resources are
diverted for war. Our lives are
not threatened by mass execu-
tions of villages, strikers, and
labor movements. Guerillas
really are fighting for their
lives first and their freedom
second. We in the U.S. are
fighting for the right to an equal
satisfying life and freedom.
Resistance to oppression is the
unifying goal for both move-
ments. For women, feminism is
the personalizing of that goal,
and for third worlders, guerilla
revolutions are the personalizing
of that goal. Both movements
are fighting oppression, fighting
violence, and militarism. My
definition of militarism is a
system that threatens us with
genocide and represses humanity
in the name of security or
protection. Violence is oppres-
sion, denying another their right
to live and to live freely. We
really don’t need to distinguish
between physical or psycholo-
gical violence; both are potent.
But freedom doesn’t mean much
if you are dead, hence guerilla
warfare and women’s self-
defense. This personalization of
resistance to oppression is what
makes our movements powerful.
We are not theorists. We have
not found a good cause and
adopted it; rather, we have felt
oppression in our lives, recog-
nized it, and through our move-
ments we are dealing with it.
That is what the personal is
political means. We are asking
for ourselves and friends the
right to self-rule, not a replace-
ment of one ruling class with
another. Nonviolence gives us an
increased awareness of being
connected intimately with every-
thing and everyone, on every
level: emotional, spiritual, phy-
sical, and psychic. It is important
as feminists that we break down
our oppressor, patriarchy, which
is father-rule, but not by replac-
ing it with matriarchy, which is
mother-rule. We must replace it
with a revolution of self, a
revolution of consciousness, self-
rule.

Nonviolence is meditation
for me, not in trying to still
myself but by becoming con-
nected and a connector, by
having a harmonious, respect-
ful spirit and moving with it.
Nonviolence has been a real
spiritual awakening in me. It
became the strongest when, as a
war tax resister and organizer, I
was threatened by the IRS. I
realized that they don’t have
power unless I give it to them. I
have always had a hard time
connecting with the spiritual in
myself; I thought that the spirit
was some ethereal thing, hard to
connect with, but through being
threatened with the govern-
ment’s standard repertoire: pri-
son, confiscation of property,
etc., I have realized that the only
thing that they could really
touch would be my body; my
spirit is untouched because
my spirit is not ethereal, but
grounded, internal. And it is
also external because through
feeling it in me, I can feel it
everywhere.

This has gotten me to the
point where I feel high most of
the time. My essence, my spirit
is grounded in non-oppression of
other beings, nonviolence, and
my experience as a woman and
as an oppressed being is ground-
ed in feminism. Feminism and
nonviolence are not just keys
to understanding my relation-
ship with the world, but are a
strong push that integrates my
experience as a woman with the
political and hierarchical sys-
tems with which I come into
contact. These choices, feminism
and nonviolence, are the only
ones that allow me complete
freedom without sacrificing
someone else’s.

Kissed Resists

to participate in bail solidarity
and refuse community service
until all of their sisters were
released on the same terms. The
following statement is one she
issued from jail.

Anna was criticized by
other women in the feminist
cluster as being “violent to men”
in her anger because of her
strong words and actions, and
women across the board did not
offer support around bail soli-
darity over this issue. Although
Anna wasn’t speaking to this
problem in this statement (the
“they” being cops and men in
general, not women who didn’t
offer support), we felt it impor-
tant to point out that the
divisive tactics used by the boys
in blue are effective only as long
as we, as women, give them that
power in situations such as
these.

They call us thieves and put
us in jail.

We answer we are women
committed to feeding, clothing,
and teaching the many truths to
ourselves and our children.

They call us whores and,
after they pay us to do what we
will not do in love, they put us
in jail and rape us.

We answer we are women,
daughters — lovers — sisters —
mothers — wives, selling for money
(to survive) what we refuse to
give in love.

They call us DYKE, pervert,
aberration, emotionally or men-
tally disturbed and put us in jail.

We answer we are DYKES,
LESBIANS, women loving,
women affirming, life affirming,
women identified women. We
know who our lovers are.
