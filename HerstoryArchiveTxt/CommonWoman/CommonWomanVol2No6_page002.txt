“Battered
Wives”

Dear Commonwoman,

I was sorry to see that you
neglected to review our show
“Battered Wives.” It aired sever-
al days before you published the
July issue, and I would think the
controversy would have prompt-
ed a critical review from you.

I wish to correct your
editor's note, and your headline
to the open letter from the
Women’s House of Transition.
First, I did use the very valuable
input I received from the inter-
view I conducted with two
women from Burlington's Wom-
en’s House of Transition, and
this was not a closed program.
Second, the Women’s House of
Transition is not the only long-
standing project on battered
wives in Vermont. Brattleboro’s
Women’s Crisis Center has been
operating quite successfully for
more than 3 years. Third, I am
not unaccountable to women,
and offered the Women’s House
of Transition another opportun-
ity to participate by inviting
them to our planning meeting.
Their critique of the video tape
segments we showed at that time
was very helpful and insightful,
and we made several changes in
our edited tape based on their
input. If you had seen the show,
you would have known that.
Fourth, this show was produced
by an all-woman crew. We
necessarily had to hire several
male technicians, but they had
no power or control over any
part of the production.

I want to see the broad-
casting industry (Radio & TV)
become more accountable to
women, both in their hiring
practices and their programming. 
I have been working hard at this
for over 5 years, and I feel very
good about the progress I have
made and the doors I have
helped open for all women in
broadcasting in Vermont.

A copy of my response to
the letter from the Women’s
House of Transition is attached.
In accordance with your policy
of not editing copy, you may
publish it in its entirety.

Sincerely,
Marcia A. Marshall

(Editor’s Note: The pro-
gram “Battered Wives” was
broadcast the Saturday of our
layout weekend, too late for us
to write a review and have it
typeset. The last of the type-
setting for each issue is done the
Friday before publication. We
lay out the paper that weekend
and deliver it to the printer on
Monday.)

FWAP

I send my gratitude, love,
support, strength and commit-
ment to the revolutionary sisters
of FURIOUS WOMEN
AGAINST PORNOGRAPHY,
who planned and took part in
the recent actions against porn
operators. I am also very grateful
to the feminist press COMMON-
WOMAN for being available to
Vermont womyn to set the story
“straight” (so to speak) on the
actions denied and overlooked
by the mass media.

Letters to the Editors:

The article by FWAP point-
ing out the connection made by
the cops and owner's assertion
that no action took place
because there was no sign of
forced entry; and men’s language
defense of rape, was superb
(there was no sign of resistance;
there was no indication of
assault, there was no sperm,
there was no...).

For me the issue of censor-
ship is far outweighed when the
result of men’s “freedom” is
bodily and psychic violence
against womyn. What about our
right to life, liberty, etc. etc?
The crimes that have been
historically condoned in the
name of freedom have been
against womyn — rape, batter-
ing, illegal and unsafe abortion,
forced pregnancy, forced hetero-
sexuality. These have all been
tools of our oppression.

I want womyn free of the
thoughts that every man is a
potential rapist, that every time
a wommin makes a move (or
DOESN'T make a move) that
she is a potential victim. This is
the censorship under which we
live. The actions of FWAP prove
that this is no longer acceptable
to us. Their actions in the name
of all womyn say we will not sit
back and be victims, that we will
not give away the power we have
to defend ourselves, nor the
right to defend ourselves, and
that we womyn will take control
over all areas of our lives and say
in words, in paint, or in what-
ever else we choose: NO MORE!
We are about to tell our own
story and it has a new ending
written by womyn!...

In love with Sisterhood.

Dear Women,

I was very interested to read
your feature on valium in your
July, ‘79 issue (p. 6).

I would really appreciate it
if you would share with us any
more information about the
findings of the Great Britain
doctors and Canadian doctors.
Or, if you could let us know of
any resources for further infor-
mation,

Thank you for your help. I
really enjoyed reading your
paper!

In sisterhood,

..Thank you and keep up
the good work. The paper is
inspiring in its tenacious insis-
tence that it will happen and it
will speak for women. I want
every issue.

Letter
From the

Collective

The issue of abortion is
crucial to women’s liberation. It
is the right to own and control
our bodies. It is a basic and
minimal demand for controlling
our lives. Men have colonized
women’s bodies since patriarchy
began; making us chattel, mak-
ing children property, raping us
and denying us abortion and safe
birth control.

In the obfuscation about
morality that a hypocritical
organization like Right to Life
(that misnomer) spouts, these
simple facts get forgotten. Man-
datory motherhood is what
Right to Life would force on us.
They do not care about women’s
right to live. Women will have
abortions whether or not the
church legislates morality. More
women died of abortion in one
year prior to legalization than
men did in Vietnam. Clearly the
issue is not life but that the
church and the extenders of its
philosophy refuse to see women
as autonomous, free-willed be-
ings.

Organized religion is not
much different in this respect
than it was in the middle ages
when it was chiefly responsible
for the death of nine million
killed as witches. This is the
holocaust that Right to Life
never mentions. Women are
again in touch with their power
and our old enemies are again
trying to destroy it.

The people who oppose
abortion also oppose the Equal
Rights Amendment and are
against gay rights. Their chief
appeal to women is grant-
ing them status in their role as
mothers. But when that role is
legislated by male laws and
theology there is no power in it
for women, only the terrible
responsibility of motherhood
without the power of choosing
that role. Those most adversely
affected by anti-abortion forces
have been those least able to
fight back, namely poor women
who are also the most likely
victims of forced sterilization.

Commonwoman, for the
reasons given above, would like
to publicly endorse the work
that the Right to Choose organi-
zation is doing to keep our rights
to our bodies. Many women
have felt that the issue was over
with the Supreme Court
decision, but the mandatory
motherhood people have been
steadily eating away at the gains
we have made. It is important
that there be an organized
counterforce. We urge women
to support their rights to self-
control by supporting organiza-
tions that are acting for that
end.
