Sisters, don't be afraid of it,  
don’t confuse it,  

don't be talked out of it,  

but find it and use it  

(you don't have to abuse it).  

It's the source of our strength  
individually and together  

It’s the key to our dreams  

and images and purposes and voices.

We can share it and expand it  

(unless we lose it to the first likely bandit—  
and there are many just lurking about,  
ready to thrive on account of our doubt.)  

Sometimes it’s hard to remember  
that we are all special  

that we each have many things  
unique and striking about us.  

We must truly begin to act on our words  
and theories about equality, respect and sisterhood.  

We can give each other support  

and encouragement to create  

to state our opinions  

to brainstorm (without fear of censure)  
to have open debate.  

Without this we'll surely stagnate  

and be drowned in our hate.  

The hostility, the negativity  

the brutal judgments and analyses  
that have hovered over our  
women’s “community”  

not just on the women with “power”,  

privileged by looks or class or racial background,  

but on us all.  
There is an air of expectancy,  
waiting,  
who is next on the list  
for public evaluating?  

Oh, goddess forbid  

don’t let it be me  

how can I avoid this close scrutiny?  
I know! I'll be elusive,  

no risks will I take  

I'll keep a low profile  

so I won't make mistakes.  

I won't do or say anything noticeable  
(I won't even let myself think  

it could be dangerous  

what if I disagree  

with those who are setting  

the “rules” for me?  

It could be dangerous).  

It is easier to see and say this  

from my current distance  

But better than not saying it at all.  
(which is what I’ve done up till now).  

It may seem like I’m bitter, resentful  

DPVOWVOOD PERSONAL POWER PWOOOOOW  

I see it more clearly each day  

as the distance increases  
geographically and psychically.  

As I catch glimpses into others' lives  
I compare and contrast  

the future with the past  

(all right NOW in the present).  

I am stronger within myself,  
responsible for my actions,  

and their effect on others.  

I pay attention to my prejudices,  
stereotypes, oppressive behaviors or attitudes,  
I invite feedback,  

wanting to pay attention,  

grow and change, all  

within the context of  

living my life as fully and truly as I can.  
Bringing dialogue, confrontation, argument  
and discussion to life  

and to meaning again.  

I share this as a step forward,  
as a reaching out to friends in Vermont,  
who I don’t forget  
who have taught me a lot these past eight years  
It is through this type of exposure  
that I get stronger and clearer.  
(What I’m saying  
is that I’m delighted and excited  
to be finding my own voice  
and I wish it also as a choice  
for all my friends, buddies and peers,  
Instead of cowering in our fears  
That we speak out loud and clear  
far, near, there, here and everywhere!)

MORGANS  

By Catherine London  

Poet, writer, and editor  
Robin Morgan discussed the  
state of the women’s movement  
in a speech given at Boston  
University on October 21. Mor-  
gan made an impassioned plea to  
all women to “spread the word,  
and fast” about “the seizure of  
our democratic process by a  
cynical, well-financed, and well-  
organized Right.”  

Morgan explained that the  
women’s movement is “in  
trouble largely because a lot of  
people had an attitude of ‘it  
can't happen here’ during the  
last Presidential election.” She  
noted further that a lot of  
“women and men were ‘too pure’  

to vote. They couldn't be  
bothered. They thought it didn’t  
matter. I think they’re seeing  
now precisely how much it does  
matter.”  

She cited the Family Protec-  
tion Act, the Constitutional  
Convention and the Moral  
Majority as the most obvious  
examples of the New Right’s  
influence upon the American  
political scene.  

The Family Protection Act,  
now “tabled” but coming up  
later for actual consideration by  
Congress, was drafted by Sena-  
tor Paul Laxalt. According to  
Morgan a better name for it is  

and blaming others for my past “shut down.”  

“the patriarch’s protection act.”  
It contains, she said, “hidden  

pockets” which could bring  
“disaster” for feminists. These  
include: control or withdrawal  
of funds for rape crisis centers  
and battered women’s shelters;  
an outright ban on homosexuals  
teaching in the schools; and the  
withdrawal of funds from any  
primary or secondary school  
which can be shown to have  
used, over a ten-year period, two  
textbooks that have shown  
women in “nontraditional  
roles.” These things combine,  
she said, to form a “feminist’s  
nightmare.”  

The greatest danger in the  
proposed Constitutional Con-  
vention is that “no one knows  
about it.” The sponsors are  
calling for a convention to  
be held for the expressed pur-  
pose of rewriting the U.S.  
Constitution, including the Bill  
of Rights. Richard Viguere, a  
powerful New Right leader (who  
considers President Reagan a  
liberal) feels that “the Bill of  
Rights is outdated” and wants to  
see it rewritten. (Viguere, inci-  
dentally, is the mastermind  
behind the Right's vast compu-  
terized direct mail solicitation  
campaign.) Morgan emphasized  
that the Right hasn’t been at all  

To an extent, fam,  
More than that, though, I am angry at myself  
for being so easily intimidated, influenced  

and passive,

secretive about this proposal,  
but that people don’t seem to be  
taking the Right’s signals serious-  
ly. She wants feminists to “get  
the word out” about this and all  
the other Right plans to control  
our lives.  

Morgan feels that the Moral  
Majority’s stand on abortion is  
best summed up by Simone de  
Beauvoir’s comment thirty years  
ago about the Catholic church:  
“The Catholic church reserves its  
uncompromising support for life  
in the fetal form. Once you pass  
out of the fetal form — forget  
it.”  

She noted that the present  
“backlash” is, from an histori-  
cal perspective, a bizarre sort of  
compliment, even evidence that  
we've been doing our work,” but  
conceded that “it is depressing  
to have to fight yet again for  
things we thought we had  
already won.” This backlash is  
also coming, in two forms, from  
“what is left of the male Left.”  
They care “more about whales”  
than about women’s issues, and  
“have been defending pornogra-  
phy,” she said.  

Morgan claimed that the  
larger society has witnessed the  
“normalization of violence  
against women and the main-  
streaming of ‘sadomasochistic  
chic’ with little or no real  
alarm. She decried the corres-

ponding lack of repentance of  
rapists for their crimes and the  
heightened incidences of adult/  
child incest, which she charac-  
terizes as “the sexual abuse of  
female children.” (Male adult/  
female child type incest occurs  
in 85% of all reported cases of  
incest, she said.) This acceptance  
of violence is a very important  
facet in its journey from the  
“fringes of society to the main-  
stream.”  

Morgan advised women to  
organize and use the Moral  
Majority’s tactics to start playing  
hardball politics. She favors the  
use of cards and letters or  
telegrams to Congress, support-  
ing candidates with time and  
money, and basically a return to  
activism. She emphasized that  
the Moral Majority is listened to

by politicians because they pro-  
duce bags full of letters to  
candidates, and that liberals have  
not been making their voices  
heard in opposition.  

Her final words of advice  
called for “a synthesis, a balance  
between intellect and emotion,  
between patience and urgency.”  
She cautioned the audience to  
think about the present political  
situation. “A look at the facts  
will startle anyone who feels  
that the revolution is over, the  
problem is solved.”
