MARCH/APRIL, 1981

Commonwoman Reaching Out

(The following is an edited
transcript of a conversation
which took place between some
Commonwoman workers at a
meeting held February 16, 1981;
Dee Dee Taylor was a guest at
that meeting. The topic was how
we could broaden our appeal
and reach out to more women.)

DIAN KENDRICK
MUELLER: I want to say
something about my commit-
ment to Commonwoman. You
know that in the time I’ve been
with the paper, which has been
since the beginning, so it’s been
almost three years, periodically
I’ve had these upheavals where
I’ve re-evaluated the whole thing
and I’ve questioned whether I
wanted to stay. I’m in the

———process now of having one of

those upheavals, seriously consid-
ering whether I want to stay,
and the conclusion I've come to
is that I’ve had a really great
experience with Commonwoman
— it’s been difficult sometimes,
but on the whole it’s been
very good, very enjoyable, very
worthwhile — but I feel as if I’ve
come to the end of that particu-
lar kind of experience. If Com-
monwoman is not going to be
what we're talking about now, if
it’s not going to be broader, if
it’s not going to definitely
try to appeal to other women
like me — moderate, straight
feminists — then it’s fine for
Commonwoman to go on, I
think there’s a place for Com-
monwoman even if it just stays
the same, there is a place for it

and there is a value to it existing,
but I’ve come to the end of
where it’s valuable for me.

I very much have always
wanted, and I know other
people have, too, to appeal to as
many women as we can in
Vermont with a feminist mess-
age. Now I’m wondering whe-
ther in fact that’s possible. Can
you combine all this in one
paper and reach all these
women? The problem that I see
is that the conservatives don’t
want to read about the radicals,
some of them don’t even want
to hear the word lesbian, and the
radicals are bored by, turned off
by the conservatives and don’t
want to hear anything they've
got to say, so is it possible to

present a true spectrum of
feminist opinion in one paper?

LINDA WITTENBERG:
Maybe that’s what we should
have an issue on, and really push
people who think that they want
to have a paper at all to write
about that. It’s a unity issue in a
way, I guess — do we want to
have unity, can we have unity in
the paper?

DEE DEE TAYLOR: I
think sometimes the paper tries
to do too many things, so it’s
lesbian radical, and it’s got
comics in it, and then it’s
got beautiful poetry and beauti-
ful artwork — it’s got so much
going on in it, and it’s because
it’s changed so much over the
years and a lot of different

things have gone on. I think to
achieve a wider appeal, you
shouldn't try to do so many
things.

CAROL COHEN: Are you
suggesting that if we get radical
lesbian contributions, that we
reject them? The thing is that
we've had to put out a news-
paper of generally 16 or 20
pages, and we usually print
everything that we get.

MAXINE MERRICK: But if
we got more articles, then we
would have to reject some
things.

DIAN: If we start getting
more than we can print, then the
editorial committee or the col-
lective is going to have to have
some guidelines to decide what

and what not to print.

JULIE ORVIS: I don’t
think we have to take a moder-
ate line. One can be very radical,
but the way that one approaches
that radicalism is I think what
makes the difference. I think
that where the policy has to be
is in approach. I think what
Commonwoman needs to do is
give information on all different
kinds of women, whether
they’re radical or conservative,
black or white, working-class or
middle-class, or whatever. And
I think that instead of rhetorical
comments on what classism is,
the only way to know what
classism is is to talk to a work-
ing-class woman, and the only
way to know what racism is is to
talk to a black woman. We know
as women that the only way to
learn what sexism is is not to
talk to a man, but to talk to a
woman. And that’s the approach
we need to take, is to listen to
ourselves and to women from

other groups, women with
different political perspectives.
For me, it’s a matter of

approach, it’s not a matter of
subject matter.

DIAN: One thing to con-
sider is that we have established
a reputation. There are, of
course, thousands upon thou-
sands of people in Vermont who
have never heard of us, but of
those who have seen us or read
us, they have an idea of what
Commonwoman is. People in
talking to me have called the

BATTERED WOMEN: 1 out of 2 Are Victims

By Susan Henry

When I became a volunteer
to help battered women last
September, I had a certain idea
of who battered women were. I
pictured a woman who, when
none of us can feel totally safe
on the streets, had no refuge in
her own home; a woman who
lived under constant fear and
tension; a woman whose fears
were often realized in the form
of violent physical beatings and
wrenching verbal abuse; a
woman whose love and forgive-
ness and hope were constantly
betrayed by the object of her
compassion.

I still have that picture. It
represents a personal part of the
complex and widespread prob-

lem of male violence against
women. Because it is vital that
we learn about and confront the
problems facing battered women
and our society, I am going to
repeat some of the information
that was exchanged at a Presen-
tation/Discussion about Battered
Women held at Church Street
Center in Burlington — which
established many startling facts
and constructive theories that
need to be publicized.

The meeting was led by
Deane Brittingham, Coordinator
of the State Project Against
Domestic Violence, and Deborah
Ennis, of Women Helping Bat-
tered Women. Deane talked
about some of the national
statistics that have been put

together by the FBI which bring
the enormity of the problem
into focus. We cannot separate
ourselves from these figures. We
are all being counted here.

One of every two women in
this country experiences batter-
ing at least once in her lifetime.
One of every four experiences
incest. One of every eight
experiences rape. Ninety-seven
percent of all violence between
men and women occurs against
women. Twenty-five percent of
the murders in this country are
against women by their hus-
bands. 12,480 women will be
battered in Vermont this year.

Battering means physical
abuse — slaps, punches, kicks. It

is usually accompanied by harsh
verbal and psychological abuse.
It may also include sexual abuse.
Women rarely initiate the vio-
lence and they rarely fight back.

Men may know what areas
of the woman’s body they will
batter, often places which are
not publicly visible, and they
may develop and repeat the
same patterns. Incidents of bat-
tering tend to increase during
pregnancy, when battering in the
stomach area occurs more often,
and when a woman begins
working outside the home,
lessening her dependence on the
male. Incidents of battering also
occur more often during the
winter months, when people are

more isolated in their homes,
during holidays, times of family
tension, and during hunting
season, a time of much male
camaraderie and frustration.
Though a batterer will promise
that he will never batter again,
his violence usually increases in
time. It does not lessen.

Deane and Deborah also
explained “The Cycle Theory of
Violence” developed by Dr.
Lenore Walker and available in
her book The Battered Woman,
an excellent resource for people
who would like to learn more.
The theory describes three stages
in a cycle of battering. In the
“Tension Stage” the woman is
