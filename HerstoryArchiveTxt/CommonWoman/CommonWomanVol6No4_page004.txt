Racism at Northgate

Myrtice Wilson, the mother
of four children, says she is the
only Black living in the North-
gate Apts. complex off North
Avenue. On the last Sunday in
May, at 10:15 p.m., a neighbor
heard a young man in a group
of about 20 men who emerged
from the woods at the complex
say “the Volkswagen.”

The group proceeded to
rock Wilson’s car from the front,
side and back, apparently trying
to roll it over. Hand prints and
a hiking boot print were ob-
vious on the hood and driver's
door. Wilson heard stones being
thrown at the car later. Her car,
in rough shape already but
running, was left with a flat tire
and a bent down front bumper.

“Apparently, I was the tar-
get,” Wilson said. “I do feel this
KKK has a lot to do with it...
I never had this problem before.
I don’t think I've crossed
anyone.”

The KKK held rallies recent-
ly in Wilmington and Brattle-
boro, Vt.

Wilson lamented that even a
small amount of damage is more
than she can afford. Unem-
ployed, unable to find work, and
with four children to support,
times are hard.

The racial overtones she sees
in the incident make the inci-
dent something more than a
youthful prank: Talking with the
neighbors, who witnessed the
determination of the men in
choosing Wilson's car, she came
to think more personally of the
incident.

The police meanwhile say
that their investigation so far has
given “no substantial indication
it was racially motivated.”

She is not sure just what
the police might do to resolve
the matter, but her frustration
is evident. “From the looks of
things, there isn’t going to be
very much done about this,”
she said.

Anti-Abortion
Bill

At present there are three
anti-abortion measures awaiting
consideration by the Senate in
Washington.

The first (S.2372) is spon-
sored by Senator Mark Hatfield
(Oregon) and states that Con-
gress has a duty to “ensure that
the federal government not kill
innocent human beings or assist
others to do so.” The bill would
prohibit insurance coverage of
abortion for federal employees
unless the woman’s life was in
danger, or an additional pre-
mium was paid. No federal funds
going to medical schools could
be allocated for training in abor-
tion techniques. In addition,
anyone could bring civil action
against a provider alleged to be
in violation of the above funding
provisions. Consequently, pro-
viders would experience
increased harassment from anti-
abortionists, under the pretense
of enforcement of the act.

Another bill (S.J. Res. 110)
sponsored by Senator Orrin
Hatch (Utah) states simply, “A
right to abortion is not secured
by this Constitution. The Con-
gress and the several states have
the concurrent power to restrict
and prohibit abortions: Pro-
vided, that a law of a state which
is more restrictive than a law of
Congress shall govern.”

Another version of the
Human Life Statute (S.2148)
sponsored by Senator Jesse
Helms (N. Carolina) grants per-
sonhood to a fetus and endows
the fetus with the Constitutional
protections granted other citi-
zens. It also makes permanent
the Hyde Amendment which
prohibits federal funding for
abortion.

Action on these bills may
occur the first week in June.
Senators Leahy and Stafford of
Vermont traditionally vote pro-
choice, but need your telegrams
and letters encouraging them to
stand firm. Their addresses are:
Senator Patrick Leahy,
1203 Dirksen Senate Office
Bldg., Washington, DC 20510.
Senator Robert Stafford,
5219 Senate Office Bldg., Wash-
ington, DC 20510.

For updates on the status of
federal abortion legislation, con-
tact the Vermont Women’s
Health Center, 863-1386.

Each Zapper costs less than
a gold chain bracelet — about
$40. So trade in your chains for
cuffs a la Wonder Woman, and
jog anywhere, any time, in
freedom. For information on
how to obtain a Zapper, call
Personal Security Devices, Inc.

Plotkin’s invention.

If you hitchhike and fear
jolting the driver threatening
you, Plotkin says buckle your
seatbelt, lean back and kick the
windshield, which is designed to
pop out from the inside. If your
seatbelt is buckled and his is not,
hit the brakes. Once the car is
stopped you can safely zap the
miscreant and make your escape
good.

SPORTS

Field Hockey

If you have played, coached
or enjoyed the game of Field
Hockey at some point in your
life, and would want to work
part-time this fall at an active,
exciting job, maybe you'd like
to be a referee for women’s
high school games in Vermont.
Whether you have officiated
games before or this is a new
idea for you, there are clinics
(from a week-long especially
designed for the beginning ref,
to weekend and a one day cli-
nic) planned for skill and con-
fidence building before the sea-
son starts. All you need is desire
and some background in the
game, the ability to work after-
noons (some) in September and
October, and transportation. It’s
fun and exciting work, healthy,
and you'll meet some very neat
women. For more information
about the clinics (all in August),
call Janice Lange at 656-4009.

The Red Cross (on Mansfield Ave. off of Pearl St, near UVM)
has a small book available for 75 cents that was written especially
for parents (or others) who want to teach their children to swim
but who themselves have no training in swim instruction or even
in swimming. The book is very easy to read, and has lots of illus-
trations, and focuses on a no pressure, guided play philosophy.
It outlines a simple progression from the first time in the water,
to tips for getting the face in, through floating and the beginner
stroke. I think it's well worth the money and is a good idea for
big people who spend any time with kids in the summer to read
it and use the ideas with your little pals.
