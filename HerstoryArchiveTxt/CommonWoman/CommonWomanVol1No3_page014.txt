gone up for a FmHA loan.  
FmHA is also very lenient about  
lending any extra money needed  
for unexpected expenses (our  
well cost was more than  
estimated).

So, with faith and hard work  
it is possible to achieve a dream.  
All you need is determination,  
patience with legalities and  
holdups, and lots of confidence  
in yourself.

We are urging all low-income  
people, especially women, who  
have so long ago dismissed a  
dream similar to ours, to act!  
NOW while the funds are still  
available. We did make our  
dream a reality and ‘Hopeful  
Farm’ though not fully  
established, will one day be a lot  
more than a childhood dream.
