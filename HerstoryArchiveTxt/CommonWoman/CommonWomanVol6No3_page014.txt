OMNOWWOS

We oppose anything which prevents
women from loving each other
freely in whatever way we
choose.

We are building a feminist
resistance movement in the
tradition of the militant suffra-
gists of the last wave of femi-
nism from which Gandhi and
Martin Luther King drew their
inspiration.

We believe in and practice
direct action. By direct action
we do not mean activity which is
necessarily legal or illegal, but
intentional activity which does
not even recognize these govern-
mental sanctions. We mean the
creation of a tradition which
demands that we act directly in
all matters which concern us,
that we do not recognize a
higher authority whom we call
upon to act for us. If we believe
a parking lot should be a garden,
we might just dig it up and plant
a garden. If we believe that there
should be vigils of women
against militarism and violence
in our communities, we go out
and vigil. If we believe that
women should be free to walk
the streets at night, we will take
back the night.

We believe that direct action
and massive nonviolent civil
disobedience are absolutely
necessary to stop the threat of
nuclear annihilation. The every-
day oppression of living in an
increasingly authoritarian, mili-
tarized society is as much a
feminist concern as reproductive
rights or lesbian oppression. The
Family Protection Act, which
could also be called the Patriar-
chy Protection Act, attempts to
force us into proper male-ruled
nuclear families and to shape our
consciousness so that we accept
their authority. Our feminism is
anti-authoritarian and anti-
hierarchical.

We are the repositories of a
sensibility which can make the
future possible. Feminists must
exemplify this sensibility in our
ideas, our relationships with
each other, our culture, politics
and actions. It is by necessity
that we are utopians. We look
backwards to women-centered
societies based on respect for life
and life-cycles. We look forward
to new possibilities of reconsti-
tuting a culture which is non-
hierarchical. Peace is more than
the absence of war, as freedom is
more than the absence of
coercion; they are both ongoing
processes. Our movement itself
is a process, much as life itself is,
without end.

Weekend

An interesting mix of thought, but
women so easily draw connec-
tions between all that affects us,
that the stretched possibility
became the obvious. Great! I
didn't have to choose.

Again, a walk to the rec-
field... the bleachers this time.
The discussion was highly theo-
retical: city as media-environ-
ment vs. country, frustration at
burn-out, fund-raising problems,
media control. We spoke of
tactics with some disagreement.
Appropriate media techniques?
Not a Madison Avenue analysis...
xerox, article and letter-writing,
phoning, wheat-pasting leaflets,
postering and spray-painting
graffiti with stencils. These
things cost very little and are
available to nearly everyone. We
also talked about skill-sharing
and demystifying the less-avail-
able, more expensive techniques
of photography, video-tape and
radio. A good workshop that left
some frustration over our seem-
ing need to dichotomize: “We
can do this or we can do that.”
Finally women insisted that we
can do both or some creative
synthetical mix of many. We
ended by writing letters to our
Congresspeople about forcing
the Wyeth Plant to comply with
world health standards. A bit
feeble for me, but I wanted to
support the idea of many-leveled
work. I was frustrated that we
never did seem to join with the
other workshop...

Back to the Community
Center for a discussion on
non-violence. Getting caught up
in the same old habits of going
around and around with defini-
tions and rhetoric. At some
point, someone finally told their
own story, specific and personal,
and we understood. We talked

about destruction of property
vs. hurting people and/or the
earth, fighting back against
rapists, the idea of “not another
victim,” pacifism vs. “passive”-
ism, physical and psychological
violence, the inadequacy of
language, and anger vs. violence.
We came away defying the
categories that others would
pigeonhole us into, and feeling
clearer about our commitment
to non-violence through direct
action. Some women were frus-
trated and wanted to continue
the discussion focusing on speci-
fic tactics. I’m not sure that
discussion ever formally occur-
red.

Up the hill for spaghetti
supper at the free-school outside
of Plainfield. I changed my
clothes at a friend of a friend’s
to go back to the dance at the
Center. The dance was great as
women's dances always are: very
high energy, lots of color and
flow, our own percussion with
tambourines added to the music.
Connecting with folks through
movement since there didn’t
seem to be enough time to talk
to everyone as much as I would
have liked. Outside it rained
warm rain, and on the way home
to sleep we pushed some women
out of the mud, getting com-
pletely covered ourselves in the
process. I walked home (to the
friend of a friend’s house; it all
felt like home), munched on
some apricot-almond bread and
slept under the tree-of-life tapes-
try.

The second day began with
more workshops and good food.

Anne and my workshop on
anarcha-feminism didn’t happen,
which felt O.K. because all these
women were already doing
everything that we could have
talked about doing, so I got to
go to Adele Dawson’s herb
workshop instead. A very wise
woman, she emphasized an oral
tradition and the reclaiming of
the herbal knowledge of women
from the past. She told tales,
gave us recipes, planting and
foraging hints, and recounted
forgotten uses of many plants.
She also showed us how to use a
pendulum to help us discern
whether a plant was personally
powerful for us or not.

After lunch, Grace Paley
read two of her short stories:
“Edie and Ruthie” and “Lavinia.” Using such simple straightforward language, I was amazed
she could muster the pathos that
she did. She spoke of experiences
that had touched us all and
rendered it politically meaning-
ful and extremely moving, all
with an absolute absence of
rhetoric.

Cora Brooks continued the
“readings” with a poetry ex-
change, and she didn’t “read” at
all. She offered poetry by heart
(I like that expression), encour-
aging every woman to share a
poem, even if it was a “found
poem,” an old jump-rope rhyme
or counting limerick. She picked
up the threads of each woman’s
choice and responded with clear,
earth-oriented imagery. She
evoked lots of sighs of pure
feeling. I couldn't even pick a
favorite poem to relate here
because this ink on this page has
so little to do with Cora’s
voice...

This sedentary stuff was
followed by some free-form
dance/movement/voice stuff,
but unfortunately I had to leave.
I wanted to say something in
closing this article like “groups
woven together sharing, raveling
apart and reweaving wherever
the social/ecological gauze
needed a patch...” or some
similar such schlock. But who
needs it? I guess my ineloquence
and inability to make this article
as alive as the weekend says in-
stead, ‘You had to be there.” —

So until next time...
