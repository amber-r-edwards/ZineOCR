Tears as Terms
of Endearment

By Linda Comito

Picture yourself when you
were twelve years old, or
maybe thirteen. The kid at
school you have a crush on has
stopped paying attention to you.
Your parents decided that you
can’t have a new bike this year.
Your best friend has fallen in
love with a fourteen-year-old
and is hardly ever around
anymore. What do you do?
Well, maybe, given your age and
everything, you just might think
to yourself: I’ll become very
sick. With a grave illness. I'll lie
in bed, getting weaker and
weaker. Then, we'll see.
EVERYONE WILL LOVE ME
THEN. This is the emotional
atmosphere of Terms of Endear-
ment.

Debra Winger (who is physi-
cally likable with her husky
voice and the way she can never
quite stand or walk “like a girl”)
marries a young college teacher
whom her mother (Shirley
MacLaine) despises. There is no
reason to question the mother’s
judgment. We are given an
outline of the couple’s life, and
pretty much are left to ourselves
to fill in the details of a stereo-
typic situation: the man, a
college teacher, distracted hus-
band and father, who sleeps with
the students, and the woman, a
devoted wife, enthusiastic

mother, who puts up with him.
Debra does have an affair which

think. Interestingly, this
young couple is presented as
“poor because they are living
on a college teacher’s salary.
However, they have a comfort-
able home and there is no
discussion of Debra’s going to
work.

Shirley lives in the kind of
manicured, wide-lawned house
we're all used to in movies. At
fifty (widowed for years), she
gets involved with ex-astronaut
Jack Nicholson (a hard-drinking,
womanizing, next-door neighbor
who is about her own age). We
find out that, after not making
love for fifteen years, sex with
Jack is great. Shirley plays the
kind of woman who always
wears hair spray and likes the
color pink. However, she has a
gritty, down-to-earth, no-
nonsense side to her. To me, she
is a wholly unconvincing charac-
ter. In the movies, though, it can
be so easy to accept a char-
acter like this — because she’s
there, in color, a real person!!!!

The mother/daughter rela-
tionship in the movie has been
given a lot of attention. But I
am confused. The mother wants
the daughter to get an abortion
and leave her husband. What is
Debra supposed to do — move
back in with her mother? Just
when Shirley has started a
passionate love affair?

“Well, at this point Debra
could have had her mother to
herself, because (predictably)
Jack does cop out on the rela-
tionship. But DON'T WORRY
because once Debra gets sick and
dies, EVERYTHING turns out
all right. That’s right, even Jack

comes back.

The most fascinating thing
that happens in the hospital
(when everyone on screen is
crying) is that the husband
decides that he doesn’t want to
raise the children and agrees to
let their grandmother, Shirley,
bring them up. Debra knew that
he didn’t want them all along
and she is overcome with affec-
tion when he admits it (they
finally agree on something) and
a tender scene ensues. There is
also a parting scene with the
children, but I won't go into it.

Debra’s death seemed utter-
ly contrived to me. I felt mani-
pulated by all those tears on the
screen. And I cried — I’m not at
all above being manipulated...
actually I’m susceptible to it,
especially when children and
death are involved. But, tears are
not necessarily valuable. In this
movie, which had a death in it
(it wasn’t “about” death — it
wasn't “about” anything), there
was no outrage over this young
woman with three children
getting cancer. There was no
questioning of a shaky marriage
or the lack of parenting feelings
on the part of the husband. The
ending scene brought the charac-
ters together in a visual conclu-
sion, but nothing had been
examined, so nothing was resol-
ved.

Now, there were some very
good scenes in this movie. I’m
not kidding. For instance, early

on, the husband and
wife are teasing each other. They
imitate the way each other
sounds making love. The scene
has a fresh, affectionate, honest
feeling. And it is even nicer
because Debra is very pregnant.

I’m wondering what makes
a movie like this so incredibly
popular. Because it has a few
refreshing scenes and a “real
life” (and death) situation?
I think that what has happened
is that anything resembling “real
life” is accepted by movie-goers.
So that any mother-daughter
warmth is instantly valued. So
that any older woman shown in
a sensually satisfying scene is
considered realistic. This does
take the pressure off content
and plot, not to mention qual-
ity.

But there is a problem with
this. The media is very powerful
— it is a force in creating and
preserving cultural myths.
Because this movie depends
so heavily on stereotypes, it is
conservative. Once again we
endure the picture of the wan-
dering husband and the helpless
wife. And by making every-
thing turn out so cosily in the
end, this movie actually trivial-
izes death.

Perhaps the most revealing
message in the movie comes
across when Debra goes to New
York City to visit her best
friend, just after she finds
out she is dying. At a table in a
restaurant, with other women
her age who live and work in the
city (some of whom are divor-
ced), it is clear that Debra feels
miserable and out-of-place and
that she must run back home.
She has nothing in common with
these women, the movie tells us.
She must go back to her unfaith-
ful husband to die. It is a real
set-up — there’s not much you
can do when you are in chronic
pain from a fatal illness. But
then, that’s not what the movie
was about.

Silent Knife: Cesarean Preven-
tion and Vaginal Birth After
Cesarean. Nancy Wainer Cohen
and Lois J. Estner, Bergin and
Garvey, 1983.

Silent Knife is a revolu-
tionary book. Its authors begin
by citing the horrifyingly high
rates of cesarean births in
America. They trace changing
trends in (ab)use of cesarean
section as a “birthing” tech-
nique. In 1956, a group of
obstetricians were placed on
probation for their 10 percent
cesarean rate. Today it is com-
monplace for 25-30 percent of
all births to end in c-section,
with rumors of 80-100 percent
c-section rates for some private
physicians.

Why all the cesarean sec-
tions? Physicians are afraid of
malpractice suits if births in
which they don’t intervene end
in tragedy. In addition, most
doctors feel they have to “man-
age” a birth (i.e. through surgery
if the birth doesn’t occur on
their schedules), and it is widely
believed that a cesarean section
“guarantees a “superior out-
come.” Finally, it is virtually
universally held that once a
woman has “delivered” by
cesarean section, she must do so
in subsequent pregnancies, the
rationale being that normal

For Nights Like This One, By
Becky Birtha. $4.95 plus $1.00
postage. Frog in the Well Press,
430 Oakdale Road, East Palo
Alto, CA 94303.
I read Becky Birtha’s For
Nights Like This One in one
sitting and felt ambivalent about
the whole thing. It was obvious
that Birtha is a serious writer
and took care to make the
stories clear and easy to under-
stand. That is part of the prob-
lem that I have with this book —
the stories are easy, far too easy;
often the characters in Birtha's
stories seem to do nothing more
than stew in their own juices to
avoid making any real decisions.
Or they stay with what’s expect-
ed of them by other people and
avoid any real struggle. The
preface to Lorraine Bethel’s
poem “What Chou Mean We,
White Girl?” in Conditions 5: “I
bought a sweater... When wear-
ing it I am struck by the smell —
it reeks of a soft privileged life
without stress, sweat or strug-
gle.” describes part of my

reaction to Birtha’s book if you
substitute “book” for “sweater”
and “reading” for “wearing.”

My four favorite stories
were “Four Sides Figure,”
“The Woman Who Loved Danc-
ing,” “Safekeeping” and “Where
the Journey Began.” “Where
the Journey Began” is a well-
written story of a woman who
left her lover then returns to
build a life with the lover. In a
“Four Sided Figure,” a lesbian
couple works out one of the
couple’s jealousy toward her
lover's ex-lover. I loved the idea
for “Safekeeping” that of a
woman and man who were
friends and discover that they
both “came out” to be a lesbian
and gay man. The only problem
is that most of “Safekeeping” is
written in the past perfect tense
and it becomes boring to wade
through all those past perfects.
Finally, I wish that someone
would tell Jessica in “The
Woman Who Loved Dancing”
that when a woman tries to
control or possess her lover, the
issue is that her lover wants to
control her and complaining
about Jessica’s folk-dancing is
only a pretext to establish
control over Jessica.

I also had problems with
Birtha’s vision of lesbianism for
many of the stories in For
Nights Like This One involve
one half of the couple giving up
something they really want to
please the other half of the
couple. For instance, “Babies”
involves Lurie, the main charac-
ter, giving up the child she wants
to have to stay with Sabra, her
lover. In “It Was Over Then,”
Christie and the main character
(a woman) get called “Fucking
Dykes” simply for sitting in the
nude next to each other. In
“Leftovers,” Gina gives up the
idea of wearing skirts and
jewelry because “what will peo-
ple think” if she dresses that
way and her lover wears jeans
and shirts? What sense of reality
are these stories transmitting?

The characters in the pre-
ceding paragraph may seem
somewhat passive and dependent
but the main characters in “A
Sense of Loss” and “Next
Saturday” seem to be downright
pathological. Jennifer, the main
character, in “Next Saturday” is
a closeted dyke who suspects
that Kasey Cosgrove, one of her
students, is coming out; Jennifer
proceeds to do nothing to help
the troubled Kasey. Kasey winds
up running away from home
which Jessica finds out by
calling Kasey’s home. “A Sense
of Loss” is touching where Liz
and Mandy share sadness over
the death of Liz's grandmother
but Liz is so ashamed of being a
Black lesbian that she doesn’t
tell her family she is a lesbian,
much less that her lover, Mandy,
is a white woman.
