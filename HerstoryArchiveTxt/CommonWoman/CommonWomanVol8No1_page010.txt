For a long time, I thought I  
was the only Asian lesbian  
writer around. I’m a queer  
animal (and I know it), but I  
didn’t want to be that unique. It  
was a relief when I found out  
that there were at least two or  
three others around. Kitty Tsui  
(surname pronounced “Choy”)  
is one of the two or three and it  
turned out to be a great treat to  
read The Words of a Woman  
Who Breathes Fire.

For one thing, there are  
very few writers who have the  
depth, range and passion that  
Kitty Tsui exhibits in one short  
book. She is equally adept with  
poetry and prose as the two  
examples below will show (from  
“Poa Poa Is Living, Breathing  
Light”):

“Last night I dreamt I was  
in a wide open space. A rolling  
countryside all white like it was  
covered with snow... As I  
walked, I saw poa poa standing  
in the snow, smiling at me. She  
was glowing. Then, I saw a  
bright white light coming out of  
her mouth with each exhale.

“My poa poa* is living. My  
poa poa is living, breathing  
light.”

(and from “My Poem”):

“my hands dream/ the ten-  
der places of/ your body./ my  
poem —/ being friends/ that  
sense of sharing./ my poem—/  
being lovers,/ that storm in our  
eyes,”

For another thing, Tsui is  
aware of how much needs to be  
overcome so all of humanity can  

Who Breathes Fire

be truly free as in the title poem  
of the book (“The Words of a  
Woman Who Breathes Fire”):

“i am a warrior who grap-  
ples with three/ many-headed  
demons: racism, sexism, homo-  
phobia;/ a twenty-four hour  
worker;/ a writer with the  
will to change/ the age-old  
inheritance of inequality.

“I am a warrior, a worker, a  
writer/ my grandmother's  
youngest daughter,/ a feminist  
who does not believe in silence./  
i am a woman who loves  
women,/ i am a woman who  
loves myself.”

Tsui does this without rhe-  
toric.

Tsui is also aware of her  
own particular heritage as a  
Chinese American as she shows  

OUT FROM UNDER:

Sober Dykes and Our Friends

By Joyce Cheney

Out From Under: Sober  
Dykes and Our Friends, ed. Jean  
Swallow, order from Spinsters,  
Inc., 803 DeHaro St., San  
Francisco, CA 94107. $8.95.  
240 pages.

Out  
From  
Under is an  
anthology of  
non-fiction writ-  

my. (In the book, and in  
this review, alcoholism is dealt  
with most. The phenomenon of  
substance abuse is similar, tho,  
regardless of the substance.  
Substitute drugs for alcohol if  
that’s what you need to read  
about.) Most of the chapters are  
autobiographical essays or inter-  
views. All the writers are womyn  
who experience being sober as  
an important issue in their lives,  
and in the lives of their lesbian  
communities. Most writers are  
sober dykes who've gotten ‘the  
monkey off their backs,’ their  
monkeys being alcohol, hard  
drugs, pot... Some writers are  
health professionals who work in  
rehab programs for womyn, for  
dykes. Some work in alternative  
medicine (ex. acupressure) and  
share their perspectives on sub-  
stance abuse and detox. They  
talk about what happens chemi-  
cally and emotionally during  
detox (which takes years, not  
weeks).

There is some information,  
then, about the process of  
detoxification. There are lots of  
personal stories of getting clean.

There are also writings by  
womyn who have different rela-  
tionships to alcohol than that of  
the sobered-up dykes them-  
selves: adult children of alco-  
holics, and co-alcoholics. There  
are personal stories that examine  
the dynamic of being a child of  
alcoholic parent(s); the patterns  
these girl-children brought with  
them to adulthood, and their  
recovery process from these  
painful places.

And, there are some excel-  
lent articles that discuss being a  

“co-alcoholic.” “Co’s” are people  
symbiotically involved with alco-  
holics. Co’s have their own  
patterns. Co’s patterns are more  
socially acceptable than alco-  
holism, though not necessarily heal-  
thy to the co herself, or to the  
alcoholics ones involved with,  

keep the universe  
smoothly.

Several womyn talk of Alco-  
holics Anonymous, and Al-anon  
(for co’s). (AA and Al-Anon are  
structured, Christian-modeled  
self-help groups that serve  
millions of substance abusers, all  
sorts of people.) Some womyn  
found AA too “mainstream” for  
them. Several womyn acknow-  
ledge great benefit they’ve got-  
ten from AA, through taking what  
they could from it, and letting  
the rest go by.

The book has much infor-  
mation in it, presented in a very  
human, accessible way. It is easy  
to read, goes like a novel. It is a  

hopeful book. Each chapter ends  
with the writer stating her vision  
of her community, clean and  
sober, “It would be more alive.”  
“It would be life-affirming.”  
“Being clean and sober would  
not rid the society of its imper-  
fections. However, it might  
result in more organized resour-  
ces within the lesbian commu-  
nity, since we would have  
additional energy and consistent  
clarity of thought to develop  
and maintain them.” “For starts,  
just think of the money our  
community spends on booze, or,  
the time we spend to earn the  
money we spend on booze. Then  
the strength and awareness  
drained. Then there’s the hon-  
esty, because alcohol is not the  
truth drug it has been reputed to  
be. And getting sober pre-  
supposes and demands increasing  
honesty. And that means in-  
creasing trust between us.”

“If my community were  
clean and sober, we would stop  
running  

trying to see the worst in each  
other, turning friends into  
enemies, blaming everyone else  
in the world for our own respon-  
sibilities. We would have less  
drama, fewer trashings, less fear  
and self-destruction. If my com-  
munity were clean and sober,  

we’d be in peace with  
our feelings and claim them as  
our own; we'd shine in the  
power and joy of women who  
are fully alive, who love them-  
selves and each other.”

Out From Under is a string  
of jeweled inspirations, story  
after success story, women who  
were on the bottom and came  
back up. Strong women who  
decided to do it and are doing it.  
The book is totally pro-sober.  
Totally clean, no beers now and  
then, no tokes now and then. It  
is not self-righteous. It is simply  
womyn who’ve come up from  
under, talking about how serious  
a problem they think alcohol  
and drugs are in their lives, and  
in our community’s life. They  
offer the solution that they  
found as the only one that  
works for them. Part way didn’t  
work for them.

This book raises questions  
about the place of substances in  
our lives as lesbians, as womyn,  
questions that it is time to ask  
here in Vt. Dykeland (where we  
hold fundraisers in bars, and  
raffle off champagne at womyn’s  
events, where it’s acceptable in  
most circles to be often drunk  
or stoned).

This book is about possibi-  
lity. It is time for this book here.

in her one-act play “Call Me  
Goong.” Ah Bank (“old man”)  
is fairly typical of the survivors  
of the “Bachelor Society” of  
San Francisco Chinatown. He  
has worked as a dishwasher for  
twenty years, has retired to a  
one-room apartment and speaks  
little English; he is an exception  
in that he is one of the very few  
older men who had a wife  
despite the immigration laws  

that made it virtually impossible  
for Chinese men to bring wives  
to this country. The portrayal of  
the growth of friendship be-  
tween the orphaned Chinese  
American girl who lives with her  
poa (grandmother) and the  
widowed Ah Bank is very  
touching. Tsui reminds us that  
our friends need not come from  

our own age group. There is  
strength in reaching across gen-  
der and generation lines, espec-  
ially if one is Third World in  
white-oriented North America.

Tsui writes gracefully, clear-  
ly with a passion for women and  
words. Read her if you can at all  
afford the book: if not, borrow  
the book. Otherwise, you will be  
missing an important lesbian  
feminist voice.

“poa poa means grand-  
mother.
