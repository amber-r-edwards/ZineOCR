missiles, rockets, bombs. Benefi-
cial human service technology
will never be a focus in Compu-
terland and NO I don’t believe
that computerization in the
workplace has freed people to
do less tedious work. In fact it
doesn't seem to me that com-
puters have trickled down to
workers very evenly. Maybe the
upper middles have been libera-
ted — more leisure time — but
don’t we still wash dishes the
hard way, become nurses’ aides,
and factory workers, and labor-
ers? In fact, for all the sophisti-
cation of their Columbias and
Tridents, missiles and weapon
systems, damned if there are
fewer backs aching among us.
Hell no, I won't go. I don't
believe in pac-man. The differ-
ence between psychic ability and
technology is magic. I opt for
magic. Cogitate, don’t compute.

and what is presented to the
world as reality. To its “audi-
ence.” The city is a media
environment. How often do you
see a picture of a woman wear-
ing make-up and something out
of a male fantasy? Who is in
Magram's windows? Why are
there neon sculptures and the
largest xerox in the world on
Church Street? Why is there a
rock in a cage in “Battery”
Park? A tank on the hillside in
Winooski? A familiar red, white
and blue flag in every classroom?

There are norms and guide-
lines for “objective” journalism
that are biased because they are
devised by a status quo. Why
does the “objective” portrayal
of the truly outrageous situation
in the Middle East always
include suffering Palestinian
women and children? How can
this objectivity come to support
and emphasize anti-Semitic sen-
timent? What is the U.S. role in
the warfare of the world and
why is it convenient to be silent
about El Salvador and other
world “arenas” right now while
ing Israel? War? Too
harsh a word... wish may!
or peaceful intervention. What
world “reality” does media
create?

When we hear that “war” is
made for “peace” or that “pain”
is sought for “pleasure” or that
“brutality” helps one “feel,” in
our minds, language ceases to
describe reality. Words lose their
direct relationship with actual-
ity. And thus language and
culture begin to exist entirely
independent of nature. It
appears to us therefore, that—
culture has successfully destroy-
ed the power of nature. This is
the real effectiveness of the lie.

ComputerLand,

Free and without electricity.
Some of my friends say we must
learn how the system functions
in order to dismantle it — but I
say, when they've got you
hooked on the convenience of it
they've also got you trained,
conditioned, and behaviorally
modified. Beware. They have
their PhDs in Computerland
Immobilization. I urge you to
act now. Act alone. Join a
movement. Fold, spindle, wib-
rate, agitate. Imagine a scene...

Place: Small town Burling-
ton Vermont, corner of College
St. and N. Winooski Ave.

Time: Any day soon,

Center stage a sign says,

walls — we won't find it any-
where else, we have to do it
ourselves. I got excited thinking
about a photo wall of Vermont
lesbian moms and friends and
kids. (What do all you photo-
graphers out there think?)

Some of the photos had
special effects that made them
mystical or even spiritual feeling.
I liked some of them and wanted
to know how to do what I saw.
Joan shared the info easily and
openly, so unlike the competi-
tive and protective silence I’ve
been met by in past years with
some (usually male) photo-
graphers. Joan’s helped me out
before — she shares her skill.

And I talk too much. One
last thing — a wall that looked
quite different, a sampling of
photos that Joan creates to
make her living. Pretty brave,
and rare — a woman supporting
herself as a free-lance photo-
grapher, and in Vermont. IBM,
UVM... Joan does a lot of fine
work for them — and in their
booklets and brochures the faces
of many intense and intent
women appear. I dare say there
wouldn't be nearly so many if

A note to end on perhaps.

Joan Knight is a good photo-
grapher, and she takes many
photos of women. They’re fun,
strong, beautiful, and especially,
they feel respectful and proud.
My hope is that the
encouraged other women to
take, and share, pictures of each
other and what we do. Thanks,
Joan, for the work in sharing
yours.

Poland. Their performance is a
strength, joy, pain from their
experiences as Holocaust sur-
vivors. To those who complain
that the music on stage is not
political enough, or that certain
words or phrases were not
discussed, I would answer that
having this one performance,
Henia and Dovida, was all the
politics I needed to take their
energy and intensity and bring it
back and apply it to our own
worlds helping us be supportive
of all our sisters regardless of
which step on the political
ladder they might be on their
way to sisterhood.

I would like to conclude
this section on Michigan with
my overall complaint from this
year. I came back from Michigan
very quiet and subdued (much
to the amazement of my close
friends). This is because being on
land three times as big as the
Hesperia, all my energy went to
getting from here to there,
whether it be food lines or
concerts or the great big wonder-
ful craft space. Many veteran
festival goers felt the close
energy and unified strength that
occurred in Hesperia was lacking
this year. However, there were
some good points, mainly
womyn doing music! I’m already
planning for next year!

Editor? Correction—
Henia Goodmana holecavs +
Survivor from Poland is the
mother of Dovida Tshateva,
an American feminist.

THE REAL WORLD coisies nse

(see: Watch Your Language in
this issue) as does fashion.
The New York Times recently
had a fashion supplement on
make-up called “The Bruised
Look” and the number one song
on A.M. radio for a long time
has been “Hurt So Good.” The
popularization of S&M contri-
butes to the maintenance of a
hierarchical sensibility in the
culture. Connections between
sexuality, violence and death
become clearer. Does reality
produce language or does lan-
guage create/reflect reality?

You are living a reality, I
left years ago; it quite nearly
killed me...

Crosby, Stills, Nash
and Young

Without a rigorous and
consistent evaluation of what
kind of a future we wish to
create, and a scrupulous exa-
mination of the expressions of
power we choose to incorporate
into all our relationships includ-
ing our most private ones, we are
not progressing, but merely
re-casting our own characters in
an old and destructive dominant/
subordinate mode of human
relating and one-sided power,
which is even now grinding our
earth and our human conscious-
ness into dust.
—Audre Lorde in
Against Sadomasochism
Susan Griffin draws connec-
tions between the pornographic
mind and a racist, anti-Semitic,
homophobic — sensibility. To
extend this concept to a militar-
istic, male, commoditized,
nuclear one is reasonable to me.
Numbness is the result of being
confronted by atrocities con-
tinually. I have twice had the
experience of imagining I saw a
mushroom cloud over the SACC
base at Plattsburgh from both
times the feeling was the same. The feeling was deadening.
The feeling was no-feeling. I felt
sick with fear, anger and despair
and as that settled into my
center somewhere, everything
died. All feeling stopped. No
sensation anywhere. This is the
complete reversal of the evoca-
tion of the erotic. And it isn’t
always so dramatic. We are
confronted with violence and
misogyny daily and become
numb to it to be able to con-
tinue to function in the “real”
world. “Reality,” in this case,
doesn't reflect the real world of
nature; it obliterates it and
replaces it with an artificial,
manmade one. The controlled
environment of shopping malls,
a consumer’s reality, makes the
idea of bomb shelters a much
more palatable and possible
reality. When heart/spirit fuses
with matter/the real world of
nature, the effect is stimulation.
Desire. Passion. Love. The re-
awakening of feeling.

realism (re-al-izm) n. 1/A
disposition to deal solely with
facts and reality and to reject

At some point, fantasy gets
acted on and visions become the
real work and play of every day.

Truth as storytelling. An
anecdote: When I got out of the
car with my friends Cathy and
her daughters at Cate Farm, one
of them said to the other, ‘Look
Juniper, there’s a rainbow
around the sun.” Juniper saw it
and said it was beautiful. I
looked up and agreed. Cathy
looked up and said, “There’s no
rainbow around the sun.” We all
looked again in disbelief because
sure enough, she was right.

So is reality in the percep-
tion? Whose perception of the
hierarchy? It movement is made up of well-intentioned puppets and victims of propaganda of the Commu-
nist KGB. This is anti-American.
It can’t happen here. Books and
records burned in S. Burlington
in the name of God. Pre-witch-
hunt stuff. Anti-Semitic graffiti
on the walls of Woolworth’s.
Pre-holocaust stuff. McCarthy-
ism accepted as fact in a maga-
zine with a huge circulation in
this and other states/countries.

—Reality is that which is.

—The English word “real”
stems from a word which meant
regal, of or pertaining to the
king.

—“Real” in Spanish means
real.

—Real property is that
which is proper to the king.

—Real estate is the estate of
the King.

—Reality is that which per-
tains to the one in power, is that
over which he has power, is his
domain, his estate, is proper to
him.

—The ideal King reigns over
everything as far as the eye can
see. His eye. What he cannot see

that

him.

—To be real is to be visible
to the King.

—The King is in his counting
house.

Metaphysical Misogyny

The king’s estate. The king’s
land. The king’s propriety. The
king’s property.

I chose from a lake’s

where I put her:

thumb and finger

From one side, an eye,

a head, a breast, a buttock.

From the other

a knob of earth, a long plum,
a plump

elbow. A river shaped her,

smoothed her with sand and
battered

her against the shore, and she

resisted, she is still here.
