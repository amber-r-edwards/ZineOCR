For Rose,  
My Mother  

By Vicki Smith  

I want to share with womyn  
a very personal process I exper-  
ienced these last few months  
with my mother. I could write a  
book, and may, about the many  
feelings and levels of mother-  
daughter communication that  
Rose’s sickness prompted in me.  
I will first share with you journal  
entries from last November, my  
first “understanding” of Rose’s  
dis-ease.  

Nov. 13. Phillip called to-  
night — Rose in the hospital —  
he is very afraid — I am over-  
whelmed with feelings — reac-  
tions — I fear asking more  
clarity from him.  

Nov. 14. My only blood  
sibling's birthday today — “But”  
is 28 today. Found a picture  
today of Rose at 30 and me (6)  
and But (4) on the Burlington  
Ferry — August, 1954. Now at  
30 I live in Burlington, it’s But’s  
birthday and Rose is very sick.  
I've been very sick this year.  
Rose is sick now.  

Later, same day. Phillip  
called — Rose is sick — lesions  
on her lungs. She’s had two  
seizures. Doctors are pushing  
surgery — biopsies - CANCER?  
Cancer...? I've been doing all this  
anti-nuke work... I screamed  
tonight, crying with Peggy hold-  
ing me... My mother has  
cancer?... is she dying?... will she  
die soon?  

I want to be old with her,  
living on land. What of my  
fantasy of Rose, an old lesbian,  
in a rural womyn’s community  
— ah — she told me on her last  
visit that option not unreal to  
her. Rose-mother, I am scared.  
I want you, I want life for you.  
I hurt for you in that hospital —  
COLD, STEEL, SURGERY,  
DOCTOR “GOD MEN,” nuclear  
medicine. CANCER? Where is  
the alternative therapy for can-  
cer? Is there anything but  
chemotherapy, surgery, sure  
death? Rose, you may die? Are  
you dying? Phillip says they may  
biopsy your liver this week.  
Many tests have already happen-  
ed. Two seizures — what are  
seizures? Biopsies are tests for  
cancer? I know so much about  

You’ve Come A Long Way Baby...  

But  

Alternative health therapy but I  
know nothing about cancer.  
What is cancer? Rose, you are  
eating yourself up — why? What  
is your life really feeling like to  
you? LUNGS — Breathing — Do  
you have room to breathe?  

Nov. 15. I am numbed,  
overloaded, overwhelmed. ROSE  
HAS CANCER. I want to be in  
Florida. I talked to her today.  
She wants to leave the hospital  
— has been there two weeks and  
has no trust of the doctors or  
the medicine. Her voice is so  
tired. She’s so scared. Told her  
to tell me everything — not to  
ever not tell me something like  
that again — my mother — only  
blood-related woman I’ve ever  
even seen. Leaving for Florida  
soon. Starting holistic health  
reading — nothing yet specific to  
cancer. So many womyn telling  
me of friends and mothers dying  
of cancer. So much newness. I'll  
be walking around through a  
typical day and suddenly there’s  
someone telling me of sadness,  
death and loss. Helen warm and  
hurting about her mother. Bo-  
sha’s mother — that beautiful  
photograph of her profile. So  
many of us victims of unseen  
chemicals and poisons. I hate  
this rape of the environment and  
our bodies. This is a big anger,  
raging I am. This furthest  
extreme — my mother’s death at  
the hands of nuclear technology  
and food processors. Nuclear  
power is a feminist issue. Is  
cancer inevitable death?  

I walked to Peru St. crying  
— feel fragile — leaving friends  
and process here — FLORIDA?  
I know nothing of Florida — I feel  
so bodily connected to Rose. My  
last image of Rose with no  
clothes... she was about 35, her  
body so very like mine. Afraid  
that if her body looks old to  
me I will feel old. Has been hard  
in the past to be affectionate  
with her, I want to massage her,  
heal her, take her sickness away,  
be a vehicle of helping her to  
eliminate her disease.  

End of journal entries.  

About one week after just  
hearing that my mother was sick  

By Linda Wittenberg.  

Recently the government  
issued a comprehensive report  
on the extensive hazards of  
cigarette smoking. The news  
coverage of this report — the  
points that were highlighted —  
focused largely on women and  
cigarettes. The report showed a  
large increase in smoking by  
women and children (linked  
together as always when the  
double standard — powerful/  
powerless — is about to be  
applied) and warned specifically  
of the danger (in the fetus) of  
pregnant women smoking. The  
government indicated that anti-  
smoking advertising would be  

aimed at these groups (women  
and children).  

On February 8 the govern-  
ment issued another report —  
this one on alcohol and the  
hazardous effects on a develop-  
ing fetus should the mother  
drink even in small quantities. A  
recommendation was made that  
beer and wine bottles be labelled  
to impart this information.  

The facts that alcohol  
and/or cigarette smoking are  
hazardous to a developing fetus  
is not in dispute. Women,  
pregnant or not, partake of

I went with Organa to Florida,  
Zephyrhills. Along the way we  
found books on alternative can-  
cer healing processes. We learned  
that there are many critical  
conditions, arthritis, cancer, dia-  
betes that have been healed or  
checked with combinations of  
diet, fasting, exercise, vitamins,  
massage, enemas, visualization  
therapy. Gana and I made long  
lists of ideas and took notes on  
the readings. I called Rose at  
home (she'd left the hospital on  
Nov. 17) all along the drive to  
tell her what I was reading. By  
the time I got to Georgia she was  
reading about alternative cancer  
therapies too.  

My first impression of Rose  
was that she felt hopeful, yet  
exhausted, angry and very scared  
about her hospital process. We  
did a long massage that night.  
Rose very open about her body  
with the openness of a vulner-  
able, very sick, needy woman.  
She showed us scars, marks,  
lumps. She talked about her  
bodily changes of the past few  
years. We ignored nothing.  
Nothing was unimportant.  

The next two months  
proved to be a beautiful,  
A-MAZING, supportive, yet  

scary and tense process. Organa

In Celebration  

of our  

By Joy Nelson  

We are all aware, at some  
level of consciousness, of how  
oppression subtly digs its way  
deep into our minds and bodies  
and souls, and keeps us from  
knowing (remembering) that we  
(women) have a right to exist;  
that we are all beautiful, and  
powerful, and creative, and  
capable. One way this oppres-  
sion is reinforced daily concerns  
our ability and desire to think,  
and the promoted/advertised  
“need” we have to drink, relax,  
have a good time, and not think.  
The message we constantly get is  
that thinking is difficult and not  
fun; what’s more, that we  
don’t do it very well anyway.  
And if thinking equals not fun,  
then fun equals not thinking;  
and the best way to shut off our  
active, creative minds is to dull  
them, slow them down — for  
example, with alcohol.  

Think (!) about these mess-  
ages for a moment. First off, I’m  
sure you have all had the experi-  
ence of enjoying your ability to  
think. We do this for fun, at  
work, at school; it’s the way we  
naturally deal with the world.  
Crossword puzzles, bridge  
games, term papers, a good dis-  
cussion with a friend, figuring  
out how to make something;  
stretching the paycheck over the  
whole week, using up that half  
of an eggplant are all enjoyable  
activities; these are ways our  
minds are always working —  

Minds  
solving problems, making con-  
nections, deciding among alter-  
natives. Let me distinguish here  
between thinking and worrying.  
The latter is not particularly  
enjoyable or helpful, but gets  
confused with thinking because  
it combines the need to think  
about something with the inabil-  
ity to do so, due to bad feelings,  
difficulty concentrating, being  
distracted, etc.  

Besides being fun, thinking  
is not any more difficult than  
cooking dinner or skiing. You  
have to put your mind to it; and  
distractions, worried feelings,  
being sure you can’t do it hinder  
the activity. However, it’s an  
activity we all have done many  
times — it is not at all alien or  
impossible.  

Lastly, having fun and  
drinking do not have a cause-  
and-effect relationship. It took  
me a while to figure that out  
because the message is so loud:  
DRINKING IS FUN!! Many  
people have fun while they are  
drinking, but it’s because they  
are with people they like, or  
they’re dancing, or talking; the  
fun is related to whatever else  
they’re doing — it's not because  
of the drinking. The seemingly  
causative factor has been so  
strongly implanted in us, that it  
appears impossible to have a  
good time without alcohol.  

Why, then, do you suppose
