‘WomenWomenWomen’ is  
back, with Betty Friedan, Sweet  
Honey in the Rock, and almost  
200 workshops on women’s  
issues.

Inaugurated last spring, the  
annual women’s event is spon-  
sored by the Creamery Educa-  
tional Foundation, a non-profit  
offshoot of the Creamery Mental  
Health Offices in Shelburne. It  
will be held Saturday and  
Sunday, May 12 and 13, at the  
Essex Junction Educational Cen-  
ter, Essex Junction. According  
to Hannah Dennison, coordina-  
tor of the event, approximately  
2000 women and men are  
expected to attend, more than  
twice the number which attend-  
ed last year.

The conference will begin  
each day at 8 a.m., with registra-  
tion in the lobby for those who  
have not pre-registered. On  
Saturday, noted feminist and  
author (The Feminine Mystique,  
It Changed My Life) Betty  
Friedan will keynote the confer-  
ence at 10 a.m., in the gymnas-  
ium with a speech titled “Stage  
Two — Equality — How to Live  
With It, Work With It, and Love  
With It.” Workshops will be  
offered on Saturday from 1 to 5  
p.m., including a workshop  
called “Black American Song  
and Style” to be given by Sweet  
Honey in the Rock at 1 p.m. in  
the choral room (Sweet Honey’s  
workshop is limited to 100  
people).

Sweet Honey in the Rock  
will present a concert on Satur-  
day night at 8 p.m. in the  
gymnasium. A group of four  
black women based in Washing-  
ton, D.C., Sweet Honey sings a  
cappella with rhythmic accom-  
paniment. According to the  
conference flyer, the group sings  
“gospels, spirituals, blues, and  
ballads that speak to women.”  
Sweet Honey has said, “We love  
performing at places in the  
community where music is  
needed to help people get  
through certain events in their  
lives.”

The workshop on Sunday  
will run from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m.  
and will include two large  
discussion groups led by Betty  
Friedan, one at 10 a.m. and the  
other at 11 a.m., both in the  
auditorium. Each of Friedan’s  

groups will be limited to 700  
people and special tickets will be  
handed out in the lobby on a  
first come, first served basis.  
(These tickets are included in  
the price of the conference; their  
purpose is to prevent congestion  
at either workshop.) The confer-  
ence will end Sunday afternoon  
with a closing ceremony in the  
gym.  
The cost of the conference  
is $10 per day for those with  
family incomes of $6000 or  
above and $5 per day for those  
with incomes below $6000.  
There is a limited number of  
half-price tickets (about 800)  
and an even more limited  
number of free tickets (140); the  
free tickets have been paid for  
by a jogathon which was held by  
the Creamery last fall.

Full-price tickets are avail-  
able at Grover’s Records, Kado  
and Bookstacks in Burlington,  
the Little Professor Book Center  
in Essex Junction, and the  
Women's Health Center in Rut-  
land. Full-price tickets can also  
be ordered through the mail by  
sending registration information  
and a check to the Creamery  

Educational Foundation, Box  
367, Shelburne, Vt. 05482.  
Half-price tickets should be  
ordered through the mail by  
sending registration information  
and a check to the Creamery.  
Those who need free tickets  
must pick up a registration form  
from any welfare office in the  
state (the forms are in the  
offices’ waiting rooms — there  
will be no standing in line to  
obtain one) and send the filled-  
out form to the Creamery with a  
check for half the full price of  
the ticket. Those who register  
first will receive the free tickets  
and their checks will be sent  
back to them; the half-price  
tickets will then be sent out on a  
first come, first served basis.  
Tickets sold in the lobby of  
the Essex Junction Educational  
Center on May 12 and 13 will all  
be full price. A ticket for either  
day will admit the holder to the  
Sweet Honey in the Rock

lesbian and that we'd better  
check it out and I agreed. I  
would probably have told her  
‘no’ if her stance was still  
anti-lesbian. I would probably  
have said that’s not unity among  
women if you’re anti anything  
around women’s issues.

“I spent a lot of time on the  
phone to New York City, talking  
to Betty's assistant, and she sent  
me an article Betty wrote for the  
New Republic in which Betty  
defends lesbian rights. I felt that  
her statement in that article and  
the sentiment I got from several  
women I talked to over a wide  
scope of persuasions was that  
Betty surely had gone through  
some changes and had come to a  
very strong stance that she was  
very much supportive of lesbian  
rights.”

In the New Republic article  
(December 10, 1977), Friedan  
writes about her experience at  
the National Women’s Confer-  
ence held in Houston, Texas, in  
1977. Her main concern was to  
get a very strong statement in  
support of the ERA from the  
conference. She writes:

“Late Sunday evening came  
the resolution on ‘sexual prefer-  
ence’ which, it was predicted,  
surely would tear the Houston  
conference apart and finally give

the right wing its chance to tar  
the Equal Rights Amendment  
with the aura of homosexuality,  
as Anita Bryant and Phyllis  
Schlafly and the John Birch  
groups have been trying to do  
this whole past year...

“A half hour before the  
issue was due on the floor... a  
lesbian woman whom I had  
fought bitterly eight years ago,  
when such issues first surfaced  
on NOW [the National Organiza-  

tion for Women, which Friedan  

helped found], asked me if I  
would speak in their support. I  
said, ‘No. My overriding concern  
is the Equal Rights Amendment,  
and you know how they are  
twisting the homosexual thing  
against us.’ She said, ‘Well, you  
know the ERA won't do a thing  
for homosexuals — that’s why  
we need our own civil rights  
protection.’ And somehow, even  
I changed at Houston. I never  
had been opposed to civil rights  
for homosexuals: the right of  
sexual preference seemed to me  
a private right, like the right of  
religious freedom — and, as such,  
certainly a women’s issue, a  
women’s right. But I had strong-  
ly objected to the confusion of  
feminism with lesbianism and to  
a focusing on lesbian rights to  
the neglect of issues of equality  
common to all women. But now  
I objected even more strongly to  
the way the right wing was  
trying to fan a hysteria of hate  
and fear against homosexuals, to  
cloak their real economic and  
political objections to the Equal  
Rights Amendment. It would  
have been immoral, wrong, to  
sacrifice the civil rights of  
lesbians to appease the right  
wing. It would not have appeased  
the right, it would not make

the issue go away. It would only  
increase the bitterness and divi-  
sion that for too long dissipated  
the energies of the women’s  
movement. But how simple: to  
separate the two issues by  
affirming the civil rights of  
lesbians. It suddenly seemed to  
me that if the black women and  
chicanas, who once saw femin-  
ism as a white racist tool, could  
move out of their defensive  
hangups, why couldn’t I?

“When I was recognized,  
I said:

“I am considered to be  
violently opposed to the lesbian  
issue in the women’s movement.  
And I have been. This issue has  

been used to divide us and  
disrupt us and has been seized  

on by our enemies to try and  
turn back the whole women’s  
movement to equality, and alien-  
ate our support. As a woman of  
middle age who grew up in  
middle America — in Peoria,  
Illinois — and who has loved  
men maybe too well, I have  
my personal hangups on this  
issue. I have made mistakes,  
we have all made mistakes in our  
focus on this issue. But now we  
must all transcend our previous  
differences to devote our full  
energies to get the Equal Rights  
Amendment ratified, or we will  
lose all we have gained. Since,  
contrary to the lies of the John  
Birchers, who know that the  
Equal Rights Amendment will  
do nothing whatsoever for  
homosexuals, we must support  
the separate civil rights of our  
lesbian sisters.” And I urged  
them, in the spirit of Houston,  
to join me in support of the  
resolution on sexual preference  
and waste no further time  
in getting on with our common  
business of Equal Rights.”
