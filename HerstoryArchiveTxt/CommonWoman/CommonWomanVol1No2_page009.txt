which culminated in a terse  
statement announcing the  
resignation.  

In parallel developments, both  
Commerce Secretary Juanita  
Kreps and Housing and Urban  
Development Secretary Patricia  
Harris have recently been  
publicly reprimanded for hints  
of criticism aimed at the  
President. Also, Martha  
“Bunny” Mitchell, the only  
Black member of Carter's senior  
staff, is being replaced by a male  
assistant to the President.  

In general, women “are not  
faring well at the hands of the  
various branches of government  
during the Carter administration.  
The ratification and extension of  
the Equal Rights Amendment  
has been stalemated and even  
used as a trade-off bill by  
Congress. Abortion rights are  
increasingly under attack from  
both federal and state  
authorities. The Supreme Court  
has ruled that affirmative action  
may cause reverse  
discrimination. The defense  
budget, recently proposed, had  
the largest spending ever  
authorized but at the same time  
sought to eliminate specifically,  
abortion funding for all military  
women and dependents of  

military personnel. The budget  
has not yet been fully adopted  
as written. An advisory  
commission to the President,  
formed during International  
Woman's Year, has stated that  
American women are still unable  
to participate fully in every  
avenue of life, and cites the lack  
of governmental support as a  
main barrier to equality.  

The experience of a woman  
like Midge Costanza who went  
from the streets, to the White  
House and back to the streets  
again in the span of 2½ years,  
has much to teach us. There is a  
special message for women who,  
as social activists, seek to enter  
legitimate party politics as an  
avenue toward attaining equality  
for all women. It provokes many  
somber questions and leaves us  
with no reassuring answers.  
Today, it appears that to walk  
the tightrope between the  
woman's movement and the  
political establishment,  
guarantees a high personal cost  
and an all but inevitable purging  
from both.  

Gloria Steinem has said that  
there are only two ways for a  
woman to enter Washington —  
she can march in, or she can  
marry in. Midge Costanza sought  
to change all that and planned  
on walking into, and working in,  
the city that has now decided  
she is unwelcome.  

As of this writing, the White  
House continues to be  
tight-lipped concerning the  
entire affair. The current lack of  
detail does not cloud the intent  
of those responsible for the  
continued harassment and  
sabotage of Midge Costanza’s  
efforts on behalf of America’s

candid. The physical condition  
of American prisons is better  
than that of German prisons, she  
felt, but the low morale amongst  
the women was disturbing to  
her. “I don't understand it,” she  
said. In German prisons the  
inmates are clearly unified  
against the guards; here, women  
beat up on other women. “Does  

that kind of violence happen on  
the outside here?”  

she wondered.  

Kristina looked worried and  
sad. She had just received a  
letter from her mother — the  
first communication she had had  
with her family for some time.  
Her father had recently been  
paralyzed by a stroke. The  
thought of not being able to  
return to Germany and see them  
again was clearly painful to her.  

She talked about her past  
reluctantly. She knows she is  
going to have to tell her story  
over and over again, but to her it  
is past herstory. She feels she has  
changed greatly since the early  
‘70s. She looks forward to the  
time when she can live for the  
future instead of being possessed  
by the past.  

Nevertheless, she described in  
fairly complete detail her life in  
Germany in the early ‘70s. The  
conditions then were similar to  
those in America in ‘68-’69: a  
time of high excitement and  
radical change. The German New  
Left was incensed over the war  
in Vietnam and official German  
acquiescence to American  
aggression. (Men and supplies  
often passed through American  
bases in Germany before heading  
for Vietnam.)  

Kristina attended the  
University of Heidelberg as a  
psychology major during this  
time. She took part in a  
university-funded project doing  
research in the field of mental  
illness. The point of view of this  
group, based on the psychology  
of Thomas Szasz, was that  
mental illness is imposed on the  
individual by society and the  
environment, and is not a  
disorder that has internal origins.  
Her studies caused her to  
question the traditional  
relationship between doctor and  
patient. What is ‘crazy?’ What is  
normal?  

Events conspired to give a  
focus to their insights. A new  
institution for the criminally  
insane was being built in  
Heidelberg: it was to contain  
isolation cells as grim as solitary  
cells in prisons: white walls, no  
windows, fluorescent lights 24  
hours a day: ideal for driving  
someone insane if they weren't  
there already. A group of people  
opposed to the construction of  
this new institution held a  
teach-in, in which she  
participated. Over 2000 people  
attended, but the event also  
drew police attention. A man  
known from earlier days at the  
University wrote a letter to the  
police listing people that he  
claimed were involved in violent  
activities. Her name was on the  
list. Kristina and others were  
charged with criminal  
association even though they  
were not involved in any violent  
activity. Feeling that they would  
not be able to get a fair trial and  
fearing extended detention or  
inhumane treatment several  
members of the group sent an  

open letter stating that they  
would not go on trial because  
they had already been  
prejudged. The impending trial  
was taking place in an  
atmosphere of increasing  
repression, while new laws were  
being passed which made any  
sympathy with opposition  
groups a crime.  

Soon it became apparent what  
happened when one responded  
to the police’s order to submit  
to questioning. The case of  
Kathrina Hammerschmidt  
provides an example. Having  
voluntarily gone to the police to  
answer questions, she was  
detained for several months. She  
began experiencing suffocating  
pains. She asked for medical  
help a number of times without  
receiving it, and was near death's  
door before a doctor visited her  
and found she had a malignant  
tumor. Two months later she  
died.  

Aware of these incidents, it  
was impossible to imagine  
turning up for trial. Kristina and  
her friends decided to hold a  
mock trial in the streets. Shortly  
thereafter, she left the city.  
Later she wondered whether she  
had made the right choice, but  
there was no turning back as she  
had given her word to others  
that she would not turn up for a  
fixed trial.  

Kristina told Roz and Doreen  
that she has never been a  
member of any group involved  
with violence, either before  
leaving Germany or afterwards.  
She said “I could never do  
violence. I was torn about saying  
that we wouldn’t show up for  
trial in ‘73. Later I saw a bulletin  
showing that the police had put  
us on the most wanted list. I  
became scared to be sentenced  
for things I hadn't done.”  

At some later date she left the  
country and found work in the  
medical field in a third world  
country.  

Thus it seems that Kristina is  
guilty by association. Cases  
based on this argument carry  
little weight in American courts,  
but in the increasingly repressive  
courts of West Germany, her  
future looks grim indeed.  
However, Germany has not yet  
produced legal charges against  
her. Perhaps they are waiting for  
the results of her trial here in  
Burlington Oct. 3.  

The Defense Committee  
believes she cannot be given a  
fair trial here because of the  
adverse publicity against her.  
They also believe that her plea  
for political asylum should be  

given as full a hearing as  
possible.
