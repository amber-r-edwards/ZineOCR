# The Bohemian  
Grovers’ Motto is  
“Weaving Spiders Come Not Here.”  
Womyn are Spinsters,  
weaving is a woman’s art  
we are re-weaving the web of life, we weave a world web to entangle  

the powers that threaten us all. Weaving is part of womyn’s street theatre, ritual, and direct action.  

Womyn have woven at the Pentagon, Vermont Yankee, Electric Boat, Livermore Labs,  
The womyn’s Peace Camp in Sicily is named  

Greenham Common, Seneca Falls, and the Bohemian Club.  

La Ragnatella —the Spider Web.  
Hopi prophesy says that when the time of purification is near, Spiderwoman will reappear.  

‘We are the Flow. We are the Ebb. We are the Weavers. We are the Web.’
