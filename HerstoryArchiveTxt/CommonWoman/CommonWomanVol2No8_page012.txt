COMMONWOMAN DEC 1979

By Jo Schneiderman

Last year the movie indus-
try’s response to the women’s
movement created Looking for
Mr. Goodbar and An Unmarried
Woman, films that were directed
and written by men, about
male-identified women. The pic-
ture of women that they por-
trayed was unflattering, super-
ficial and condescending, and
the movies sold well. This year
two of the few decent films have
been made by Woody

Allen, and The Seduction of Joe
Tynan, by Alan Alda,
both
self-revelatory,
breast-beating portrayals
of men from an

“enlightened” standpoint.

Manhattan is the story of a
middle-aged comedian/writer
caught in the turmoil of col-
lapsing marriages, neuroses, affairs
and New York City. Isaac Davis,
the autobiographical protago-
nist, is not the lovable klutz of
Allen’s former films, but a
selfish, insecure, cruel-but-
lovable bastard.

Joe Tynan is an ambitious
politician with a heart of pyrite.
The extent to which the char-
acter is autobiographical is un-
clear, but Alda wrote the script,
so presumably some of the lines
reflect his beliefs. Joe Tynan
politics through Washington
while simultaneously having a
romantic affair and ignoring his
family.

Both men are surrounded

REVIEW

by intelligent, competent, strong
women. Other male characters
are boorish, greedy and out-of-
touch. In both movies the
women are more logical than the
men about their relationships
and more consciously powerful.

Of course, there are differ-
ences between the movies: Allen
is both more insightful and more
self-deprecating than Alda. Yet
both movies represent a twist in
men’s consciousness which I fear
is a future trend.

“I love you, please don't
go,” Tynan pleads again and
again in response to his wife’s
criticism that he is making plans
that are contradictory to her
needs and the welfare of their
children. He is unable to talk
directly to anyone, and is most
comfortable politicking or jok-
ing. Yet for some reason his wife
stays, and we are told that he is
basically a nice guy.

Tynan is remarkably similar
to many men I have known. He
is self-centered, uncommunica-
tive, blind to the needs of his
family — but somehow it is all
excused because he loves them.
The message is: It’s O.K. that I
treat you poorly, don’t respect
your needs and talents, don’t
listen to you, and am unrespon-
sive to your requests, because I
have deep caring for you and
feel bad when you're in pain.

The old ‘60s slogan, ‘Love
is a four-letter word,’ came back
to me with new meaning.
“Love” is obscene, it does mean
“fuck,” and (back to the ‘60s)
“never having to say you're sorry.”

Allen is slightly more en-
lightened. He does all the same
things, but in the end it’s clear
that he knows that he’s a
schmuck.

So, what does the new
Hollywood revelation that men
are bastards have to do with the
women’s movement? Obviously
men control the media. If a
movie that says “A guy who
feels rotten while mistreating his
loved ones is really O.K. because
he feels pain” can become
successful and can be heralded as
“feminist” because it portrays
women as human, there is an
implication that this is as far as
men need to go. It says, to
paraphrase Phil Ochs, “Love me,
love me, love me — I'm a femin-
ist.”

If these movies are an
indication of the state of femin-
ism in the American male, then I
have to retract everything I said
in the last issue of Common-
woman (‘Men Can Be Femin-
ists’). I hope the movie version
is off the mark, but I'm not sure.
However, I still have faith that
some men recognize that “mea
culpa” is not good enough and
they won't be absolved by
repeating five “Hail Brown-
millers” to show that they really
respect women. I guess we
should be glad that men chastise
themselves for sins against wom-
en, but I’m not anxious to
forgive someone just because
they feel guilty.

So, Alan Alda and Woody
Allen: I'm relieved to know that
you feel bad about being
schmucks — you should — but
I'm not going to give you
support for it. When men begin
to change, then I’ll applaud.

HOT TIRAMISU HOMEMADE

SERVED WITH HOT FRENCH BREAD.

Review. The Woman Warrior, by
Maxine Hong Kingston

Random House, $2.95

By Margaret Cornell

I don’t know if I should
weep, cry or laugh over The
Woman Warrior. One hundred
and fifty years of silence,
censorship, broken dreams and
shards of pain finally speak out.

I feel so weary sometimes
just explaining why the word
Oriental is unacceptable, why we
prefer Asian American instead.
The burden feels so immense at
times. I flash on painful times
when white sisters are not
always so sisterly, when I feel
the pressure to use “non-white”
instead of Third World because
“non-white” is less threatening,
less political than Third World. I flash on the time when a former
lover (after watching a film on
cunts, and seeing only white
cunts) tells me that seeing only
white cunts is normal. And I
burn inside because I contribute
to my own oppression when I
don’t speak up.

Yeah, I know. There are
those white women who have
given up class privilege and fight
the system, but white skin
privilege is real and affects you
whether you want it to or not.
We have had autobiographies
written by Asian American
women (and I’m deliberately
leaving out Asian American men
because it would take too much
to write their side of it, too) and
most of them are good but not
that exciting. The first Chinese
American was an English-born
Eurasian named Sui Sin Fah who
published around the 1890s.
Then a long silence, background
for The Woman Warrior. Silence
brought on by a racist white
America. They didn’t want
Asian America so we were kept
out by immigration laws, lynched
and murdered by mobs while
the law conveniently looked the
other way.

Then Jade Snow Wong, who
wrote Fifth Chinese Daughter
and took such pains to be
inoffensive to whites, admitted
in a radio program that two
white women decided what
should be in her book for her.
Actually, her autobiography
wasn’t even her idea. It was her
teacher Elizabeth Lawrence — a
white woman — who suggested
that she write her autobio-
graphy. Of course, just before
and, for a while, after World War
II Japanese Americans weren’t
printed anywhere except in
concentration camps.

It was exciting to me to see
a book written by a Chinese
American woman from a wom-
an’s point of view who was
innovative in both form and
language, who wrote some
truths. But the lies go on, we are
ignored as writers, not included
in school curriculum. There are
three autobiographies by Japan-
ese American women, not top
notch but good, and they are
virtually unknown. So, I burn
inside. I grow up not seeing
anyone like myself in the school
books and know the pain of
that. It’s bad enough for me, but
for other kids like me... NO! But
it still goes on, You don’t exist;
your world doesn’t see you:
only the Oriental dream girl.

The Woman Warrior is a
breath of hope which shows that
Asian American women may be
coming of age as writers. Maxine
Hong Kingston writes power-
fully, strongly, simply of Asian
American womanhood, the fears
that tie one down. She learned
early to rebel, to be angry, not
to want to be herself. There was
a contradiction between what
she learned in American schools
and what she got at home.
Maxine is successful in American
terms. She got married, has a son
and teaches at a university. But
when she goes home:

“When I visit the family
now, I wrap my American
successes around me like a
private shawl. I am worthy of
eating the food.”

Girl children of Maxine’s
generation learned that girls are
not worthy even to eat the food.
They were worthless, raised to
be of use to another family.
They fit in or else they were
destroyed as Maxine’s aunt was
for breaking the taboo against
“bastards” and against having an
illegitimate child. Maxine’s was
an experience that neither
Asians from Asia nor white
Americans have. In school, she
learned she had to be an Ameri-
can female with a soft voice and
a straightforward American
stride unlike the traditional
Chinese woman's pigeon-toed,
shuffling stride. She shuttled
between two worlds, unable to
explain one world adequately to
the other. And always feeling
inadequate. One “fails” no mat-
ter what one does.

She had screaming fits that
no one understood when she was
a child. She dreamed about
doing something big and power-
ful with her life so her parents
would feel proud of her, not
ashamed of her as an unworthy
girl. The only way she knew as a
girl was to be a woman warrior
who kept perfect filial piety and
avenged her family’s hurts. But
in reality: “It’s not just the
stupid racists that I have to do
something about, but the tyrants
who for whatever reason can
deny my family food and work.
My job is my only land.”

In her way she struggled
against the “gook words” and
“chink words” at her back. The
words that say, “Orientals don’t
value human life,” that Asian
women are meant to be more a
servant than white women are.
An easy lay who serves men. I
have been told I lose my “Orien-
tal” charm when I argue a point
passionately. If you argue, if you
fight back, then... Hear Maxine’s
voice, you pay a price:

“I once worked in an art
supply house that sold paints to
artists. ‘Order more of that
nigger yellow, willya,’ the boss
told me. ‘Bright, isn’t it? Nigger
yellow.’

“I don't like that word,” I
had to say in my bad, small-
person’s voice that makes no
impact. The boss never deigned
to answer.”

The desire for love, for
some recognition that she was
worthy, spilled over into hatred
of her mother. Someone had to
