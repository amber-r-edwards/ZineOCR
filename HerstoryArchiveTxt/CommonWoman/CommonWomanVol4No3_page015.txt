a woman. I will not be surprised
if you see a number of women in
important positions — and
they'll be there only if they can
do the job. If it ends up that
everyone is a woman, that’s fine,
too. My guess is it’s going

if everyone’s a

to be a mix. I’m not going to
hire somebody that's incompetent
or not as good as somebody
else. That’s my view on that. I
know there are people who
disagree — but that’s my view.
CAROL: So to use a phrase
like “affirmative action,” do you
have any ideas about that?
BERNARD: I would say
that right now you'd find very
few women active in city govern-

ment. I would expect the
number of women active will
increase.

LINDA: And low-income
people?

BERNARD: Low-income

people will play a greater role in
city administration than ever
before. I look at people more on
a class basis than a sex basis.

LINDA: All of the papers
printed who they thought voted
for you — low-income people,
elderly people. No one men-
tioned women, the women’s
movement. I feel pretty sure
there was a large women’s vote
— not just socialist feminists, but
women who thought you would
make a difference — women who
haven't voted in 10 years came
out and voted. How come you
haven’t acknowledged that if
you are aware of it?

-BERNARD: I'm not aware
of that. Now I know we did very
well among the elderly, among
young people... among low-
income people. I suspect we did
well among “counter culture”
people. There was speculation
that we did enormously well at
the university. Based on what we
could see that was not true.
There was not a large student
vote.

CAROL: Speaking of stu-
dents, you endorsed the Take
Back The Night march.

BERNARD: What I wrote
was that rape to me is a heinous
crime and we will deal with that.

CAROL: I want to know
your feelings about the fact that
the papers and the officials say
there’s going to be no further
probe of the alleged rapes at
Sigma Nu.

BERNARD: What do you
think should be taking place
right now? Give me a briefing as
to where it stands.

LINDA: The case has to be
dropped technically because the
woman who was raped doesn’t
want to press charges...

BERNARD: She was
embarrassed and doesn't want to
go through this whole thing.

LINDA: Embarrassed isn’t
really the right word. She'll be
put through a gang rape trial
which is very difficult.

BERNARD: Well, I think
that raises a question. I would
suggest there’s got to be a way
that somebody could legally deal
with this without having to be
put on the stand and go through
all kinds of things.

LINDA: One of the things
people would like to see come
out of this Take Back The Night
march is that right now there’s

(Continued from Page 1)

not a sex-crime unit in the
Burlington police department
with any women involved in it.
BERNARD: I’m concerned
that there are relatively few
women in the police force. It’s
not just a question of affirmative
action when you have 78 police
officers and one of them is a
woman. That doesn’t seem right.
LINDA: About the police
force — I know some of your
support came from the police
department. This is confusing to
me because I know that the
Burlington police have harassed
young people, women, and third
world people.

BERNARD: Obviously, as
mayor I will not support police
brutality or harassment of any
people. That goes without say-
ing. If people have charges they
want to make I’m sure they can
make them and they have a right
to be heard. On the other hand,
I've gotten to know a number of
the fellows — mostly in the
union. These are basically work-
ing people earning low wages
and doing a very difficult job.
They deserve sometimes more
respect and consideration. There
are still people who go around
and think it’s fun to insult
policemen. There are some
policemen in certain depart-
ments, and we’re not going to
allow this in our department,
who are pigs, people who get
their kicks out of police bruta-
lity and macho business of
pushing people around. That’s
not tolerable in the Burlington
police department. On the other
hand cops get spit in the face by
drunk rich kids and they stand
there and take it — they're
trained to. Often I think there
are a lot of young people from
upper-income backgrounds who
think it's cool to be anti-cop.

LINDA: What about what
happened in Battery Park — that
wasn’t rich kids...

BERNARD: What happened
in Battery Park is generally
acknowledged to be a disaster.
What I’m concerned about is
that very often students are not
treated the same as low-income
kids — there's the spring fling
where police sat by and got spat
upon under very strict orders
not to react... they didn’t want a
full-fledged riot. On the other
hand low-income kids are dealt
with in a different manner.

CAROL: To bring it back to
women — what do you think
about a city-supported shelter
for battered women? There’s
been a whole lot of positive
outreach and educational work-
shops for police and social
workers on domestic violence,
and the battered women’s shel-
ter that we tried to have had to
close down.

BERNARD: Why was that?

CAROL: Funds.

LINDA: Is there a building
that you can cough up? They
did it in Rutland... an old
jailhouse they’ve gotten for six
months or so. People say they're
not going to give it up. I wonder
if there’s not some city-owned
building...

BERNARD: Let me just say
this. Money is very tight. I think
what you're talking

about sounds on the surface like a
reasonable idea and should be
explored.

CAROL: If there was a gay
rights proposal for job discri-
mination, general harassment,
would you support it?

BERNARD: Probably not.
When you're dealing with priori-
ties there are hundreds and
hundreds of young kids in the
city whose lives are being
destroyed — have no place to go.
They can't go to school —
they’re going into the army —
that’s my priority. I think the
First Amendment is very clear
on protecting people’s rights to
sexual freedom. I know in many
communities gay rights is a big
thing. To me it’s a civil liberties
matter. I believe very strongly in
civil liberties. If people tell me
they’re in a bar and they’re
being harassed because they’re
gay — tell me about it and I’ll do
something about it as I will if
someone has a religious belief.
They have a right to practice
freely. I will support that. I will
not make it a major priority.

LINDA: What’s your stand
on nuclear power?

BERNARD: These people
who think they can close down
nuclear plants tomorrow without
wreaking havoc on the
economy and raising utility rates
outrageously so that low-income
people cannot afford electricity
— I think they’re wrong. That’s
the other hand, those people who
think you can trust Yankee
Nuclear and the private owners
of utilities to tell you the truth
about the dangers of nuclear
power are also off the wall. So
somewhere in between that.
Nuclear power frightens me. I
don't trust the owners of nuclear
power. It should definitely be
under public control, as should
all utilities. But I don’t think we
can shut down nuclear power
plants tomorrow.
