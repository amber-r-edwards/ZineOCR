Wyeth Nutritionals, a sub-
sidiary of American Home Pro-
ducts, has announced plans to
build one of the three largest
infant formula plants in the
world next to the whey plant in
Georgia, Vt. The infant formula
manufactured here will be solely
for export.

Wyeth’s announcement was
not welcomed by citizens con-

cerned about the misuse of
infant formula in developing
countries. The problem, put
simply, is that companies are
aggressively promoting infant
formula in places where it

cannot be used safely.
A combination of stabilizing

birth rates and an increase in
breastfeeding in First World
countries has led the infant

formula manufacturers to look
to the Third World to expand
their market. However, condi-
tions in developing countries
make the use of infant formula
hazardous to the health of these
babies. To be used safely,
mothers need to be able to read
and follow fairly complex direc-
tions to mix the formula pro-
perly; access to clean water; fuel
to sterilize the bottle, nipples,
and water; refrigeration for
storage; and sufficient income to
afford the formula. When these
are lacking, the result is diarrhea,
gastroenteritis, and malnutrition.
Halfdan Mahler, director-general
of the World Health Organiza-
tion, says that “evidence from
the developing countries indi-
cates that infants breastfed for
less than six months, or not at
all, have a mortality rate five to
ten times higher in the second
six months of life than those
breastfed for six months or
more.” The UN estimates that

one million babies die each year
as the result of the improper use
of infant formula.

In contrast, breastfeeding is
nutritionally perfect, provides
the infant with immunity against
infection, requires no prepara-
tion, is always sterile, and is free.
Breastfeeding also increases

bonding between mother and
child and provides contraceptive
protection. Over ninety-five per-
cent of all women are capable of
breastfeeding. Even mothers

who are moderately malnourish-
ed are capable of adequately
breastfeeding their infants.

Why then the increase in
bottle-feeding in developing
countries? Aggressive promotion
by infant formula companies has
played a major role. Infant
formula has been advertised as

the modern and scientific way to
feed babies. As the CBS docu-
mentary “Into the Mouths of
Babes” noted, “What [the for-
mula companies are] selling is
the image of a Western baby —
well-fed, contented, and thriving.”

Promotional techniques
have included the extensive use
of free samples, and advertising
through the mass media and
through health care personnel
and institutions. These are prac-

tices which reach all mothers,
including those who are unable
to use the product safely.

Free samples are given to
doctors and hospitals to distri-
bute to their patients. Mothers
who receive free samples from
the hospital are also receiving an
implied medical endorsement for
the use of formula. A mother

who uses the free sample may
find that by the time the sam-
ples run out, her own breast milk
may have dried up and she is
now “hooked” on bottle feed-
ing.

In response to the wide-
spread health problems created
by these marketing techniques,
the World Health Organization
(WHO) brought together
national governments, UN agen-
cies, infant health experts, infant
formula companies, and con-
sumer groups to develop a
marketing code. The formula
companies were full participants
at every step in the process.
However, when they realized
they could not fully control the
final product, they began ex-
pressing their reservations. The
three U.S. companies, American
Home Products (Wyeth), Bris-
tol-Myers, and Abbott Labora-
tories then announced their
intention of pressuring the U.S.
government to vote against the
code. The industry opposition
shocked the other participants
who had expected industry
would agree to the code since it
had been a negotiated compro-
mise.

The WHO code is a non-
binding recommendation which
sets guidelines for the marketing
of infant formula. These guide-
lines do not make the formula
unavailable to those who need or
wish to buy it, but are only an
attempt to prevent the creation
of an inappropriate and unneces-
sary demand. The code calls for
the elimination of direct adver-
tising to the public; contact
between company sales person-
nel and pregnant women and
mothers; posters in health care
facilities; gifts to health workers;
and bonuses related to the sale of
formula. The code requires the
statement of the superiority of
breast milk on all informational
and educational material, warn-
ings about the improper use of

HOMOPHOBES

Montpelier, VT — Two
officials on the Governor’s Com-
mission on the Status of Women
who have been accused of
discriminating against a lesbian
have claimed sovereign immu-
nity in the suit being brought
against them.

According to Peter Lang-
rock, the attorney representing
the commission's executive
director Anne Sarcka and Chair-
woman Betty Jones, representa-
tives of the state cannot be sued
without the state’s permission.
"It's a very difficult legal ques-
tion,” he said.

Deane Brittingham, who
claims she was not rehired as
manager of the commission’s
Project Against Domestic Vio-
lence even though, she says,
the job was promised to her, is
suing Sarcka and Jones for
“misrepresentation” and “fraud”
in the amount of $50,000.

Brittingham, who maintains
that she has not yet been given
an explanation for her not being
rehired, said she is “shocked at
their arrogance” and disturbed
that women who call themselves
feminists would use the state,
“an arm of the patriarchy,” to
deny her what she thinks she
deserves: an explanation.

Brittingham said that batter-
ed women across the state have
suffered as a result of her not
being rehired and that, if the
court upholds the claim of
sovereign immunity, many other
homosexual state employees
who may be discriminated
against will be hurt.

Discrimination based on
sexual preference is not prohi-
bited in Vermont.
