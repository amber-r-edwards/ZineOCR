DEAR CALENDAR READERS: There will be no more  
calendar in Commonwoman  
unless a woman volunteers to do  
the job, since I, Etana, am going  
traveling and will no longer be  
doing the calendar. The job  
requires about 2-3 hours on the  
telephone making local calls, and  
1 hour typing the information  
collected, to be ready for the  
typesetter. This is 3-4 hours,  
once every 6 weeks. A more  
creative job could, of course, be  
done, by adding women in art,  
music, poetry, or expanding the  

calendar in any way. PLEASE?  

VOLUNTEER TO DO THIS  
JOB. Call Linda, 863-2977,  
or Laurie 863-3586.
