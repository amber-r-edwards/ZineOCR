World Premier  

The world premiere performances of Monique Wittig’s new  
play The Constant Journey will be presented in Goddard Col-  
lege’s Haybarn Theater on March 30 and 31 at 8 p.m.  

The Constant Journey is a feminist version of Cervantes’ Don  
Quixote. In Wittig’s play, Quixote and Panza are heroines com-  
bating ignorance and injustice. Quixote writes adventures on  
which she models her own exploits. Panza leaves her husband and  
children to follow Quixote. Quixote’s mother, aunt, and sisters —  
heard but never seen — represent different voices of a culture that  
will either advance or defeat feminist concerns. The play is  
experimental in form. The action we see on stage performed by a  
mime and a clown is both a complement and a counterpoint to  
the dialogue of the scenes recorded on the soundtrack that we  
hear simultaneously. This cinematic technique dissociates move-  
ment and word in order to give greater clarity and power to both.  

Monique Wittig, French novelist and feminist theorist, is best  
known in America for her novel Les Guerillères. Since its publica-  
tion in Paris in 1969, it has been translated and published in eight  
countries. Other publications include The Opoponax (awarded  
the Prix de Medicis in 1964) and The Lesbian Body.  

Monique Wittig, the actors, and the production company will  
be in residence at Goddard College from March 15 through March  
31. They will present workshops in clowning, mime, and other  
theatre techniques. Watch your local paper for dates and times of
