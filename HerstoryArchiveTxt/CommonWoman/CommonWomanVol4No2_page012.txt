OGpaper a “radical rag” or a
“lesbian rag.” If we want to
reach moderate feminists —
whether straight or lesbian — we
can’t do it unless we change that
image.

CAROL: Another thing is,
you could fill up a newspaper
with all sorts of things to appeal
to straight women, but if you
mention the word lesbian once,
that’s it. And I can’t see a
feminist newspaper that absol-
utely has a policy to refuse to
mention the word — lesbian
because it’s going to offend.

DEE DEE: I find that the
Vermont community is very
open-minded and there are a lot
of people out there who support
lesbians a hundred percent, and
they support the issues of
feminism beyond what we ever
even think. Maybe the wider
scope has to be one of approach
and style, and still be as radical
as hell and tear down those
walls.

JULIE: Sometimes I feel
that what's happening with
Commonwoman is that we lose
faith in what Vermont women
are really thinking. Having
worked with really straight
women for the last year, I know
what comes out of their mouths
and how sick and tired they get
of things and how radical they
really are, and how intelligent
they really are. I don’t think we
can lose sight of that; I think
that’s what we forget.

DIAN: We have a policy
that we don’t accept contribu-
tions from men, except occa-
sional letters to the editor, and
we say as little about men
as possible. I want to continue
the policy of not accepting
contributions from men, but in
reaching straight feminists I
want to be able to talk about
men, because there are men in
their lives — they’re married, or
they have male lovers, or they go
out with men. Many women
have grown sons — you don’t
have to be straight to have a son.
In the past when we’ve talked
about this, people on the editor-
ial committee have said, ‘I don’t
want to read articles that deal
with men and how to get along
with men.” But men are part of

life for some women, and there
are some things that could be
said about that.

LINDA: One of our early
policy decisions was that we
wanted to see things in Com-
monwoman that you didn’t see
in other places, and I still feel
like women have plenty of
access to see things about their
relationship with men. One
exception I can think of is
writing about single mothers or
lesbian mothers with male child-
ren and dealing with issues of
male children. I feel turned off
by the idea of articles about
men/women relationships.

MAXINE: But some straight
women get put off the way you
do by articles speaking of
women together.
LINDA: It’s not all right
with me for you to say that,
because as a lesbian woman the
access that I have in this culture
to information about lesbians is
much smaller than the access
that a straight woman has in this
culture, not only in terms of
written media, but in terms of a
million and one things, to
support from her family, from
her community, from her
church, from her synagogue,
whatever it is. So to make a
comparison saying it’s the same
thing makes me angry.

I want to see women
focusing on things that are
important to women, whether
they’re straight or not, that
don’t have to do with their
relationships with men. There's
tons of stuff. Let's write about
mastectomies, and cancer, and
uterine cancer, and cervical
cancer. I can think of a million
things we haven't touched in this
paper without having to start
saying, “Let's talk about men.”
GWYN MARILYN: In other
words, if it was a woman who
was married and she had a
mastectomy, she would be
talking about her feelings about
her body, and her feelings about
relating to her husband; men are
going to be into this.

LINDA: That feels all right
to me, that doesn’t feel the same
to me as thinking about writing
articles for women about how to
feminize men.

I'm afraid of sitting in this
room and hearing a lot of people
saying things about us being too
radical. My fear is that we’re
going to try and be really
middle-of-the-road. I'm afraid
that if we begin to reject mater-
ial that comes from lesbian
women, that what we'd be doing
in effect is rejecting material
from women who've supported
this paper for three years finan-
cially, emotionally, and with
material, in every way. I under-
stand the need to broaden and I
want it and I've always wanted
it, but I guess I don’t hear
enough of a sense of respect for
what the women who've put
into the paper have put in, when
other women have not risked to
put out.

MAXINE: Linda, I don’t
think what you said was fair,
about us not respecting those
who have supported the paper. I
know of many people who
wanted to support Common-
woman for a long time, and I've
been one of them, and my sister,
and a whole circle of people
around them. They've wanted to
support the paper, but didn't
because of the views, because of
so many radical views — they
couldn’t handle it.

LINDA: Why didn’t these
people come to a meeting?

MAXINE: I’m talking about
financial support. These are
upper-middle-class women. I
know how they feel — that they
were left out and that they
didn’t want any part of it after a
while.

LINDA: How did they get
left out?

MAXINE: Because — they
don't believe some of the things
that were written in the paper,
most of the things that have
been written in Commonwoman,
and they don’t accept them as
well as other people can. And
they have really felt left out.
And they’re lesbians.

LINDA: We've wanted them
to speak out in the paper. Let
people tell us what they think,
write a letter or an article, do
something to let us know they're
not happy. But no one did that,
none of those people — they're
invisible. And they have to take

Commonwoman Reaching Out

some responsibility. Common-
woman has tried to take some
responsibility, but people need
to take responsibility to push,
they have to take risks, and I
don’t see it coming.

DIAN: I believe that we all
have individual responsibility,
and if we don’t shoulder our
responsibility, we pay for it one
way or another. I know we have
wanted all sorts of women to
come to some of our meetings.
But I also know, through my
experience with many different
women, that most women are
not going to go to a meeting and
speak out about their real
feelings. Commonwoman meet-
ings are threatening to many
women. You know, that’s part
of being a woman — you don’t
speak up, you don’t give your
opinion, you don't get into
trouble. And these are the
women I want to reach with a
feminist message.

MAXINE: I think we just
have to start with one of the
people inside writing something
on the outside and just starting
to push the other way. And then
they'll meet halfway.

LINDA: I'm not sure that if
we reach out again that people
are going to respond. I think
that they'll criticize, but I don’t
have the faith that they'll put
the energy out, that it’s that
important to them to have a
communication paper in Ver-
mont for each other to read
what they’re thinking about.

The people who have written for
the paper are the people who
wanted to share their ideas.
CAROL: Yes. That step —
of criticizing, or feeling that you
really have something to say, the
actual writing an article and
putting your name on it and
having it printed in the news-
paper — is a huge step. I remem-
ber when I wrote a few articles
for the paper the kind of
changes I went through, because
it feels very, very exposing. I
don’t know which women
you're talking about, but per-
haps they weren't ready or
couldn't, for whatever reasons —
and I’m not condemning them —
to take that particular step.
Whereas other women had
reached some stage in their
progress where they felt that
they had nothing to lose any-
more, or whatever the case may
be.

DIAN: I want to continue
seeing radical articles, I want to
continue seeing articles by and
about lesbians. I want, in addi-
tion, to see articles by and about
moderate feminists who may or
may not be lesbians. This is
terrifically important to me.

LINDA: I’m willing to see
what happens in terms of
wherever the new energy on this
paper is coming from, to pull
whatever the hell you can into
the paper. I mean, not whatever
the hell — I mean, whatever we
can within what we might define
as feminism. I'd like to see the
paper be 24 pages or whatever
we could do. I want new infor-
mation in it a lot. I want more
news, especially international
news.

DIAN: We do this periodi-
cally — we look at ourselves —
we've done it so many times
before. We look at ourselves and
we make some changes and we
try to reach out more each time.
So we're doing it again. We're
asking women who read us to
write for us, too, to send us
their articles, their poems, their
short stories, their letters, their
graphics, their photos,

LINDA: And their adver-
tising money.

DIAN: And their advertising
money, and their pledges, and
their subscriptions. I hope we
get a response.
