Grade Z

Dear Commonwoman:
I was very pleased to see
that there were other women
who did not appreciate that
recent article on shoplifting. I
did however think that the
letters you printed which were
in favor of the shoplifting article
lacked a clear analysis for their
position. One was a rather
spacy “if it feels good do it” and
the other was based on the
author's subjective feelings
about the world rather than
objective reality, i.e.: seeing the
world as you want it to be —
rather than how it is — when
Exxon etc. change then I will.
This reasoning is inconsistent
with going out and making
change yourself instead of wait-
ing for it to happen.
I thought that the abortion
coverage was ok but more could
have been done to cover the
demonstration in Montpelier and
which organizations participated
in it and their analysis of its
successes or failures.
I read the article about the
vibrators and I was very dis-
appointed by its low caliber and
lack of political maturity or
understanding. I have read a
couple of other articles by the
same author and I feel that she
has a difficult time considering
any material which does not
revolve around sexual pleasure,
men’s or women’s. There was no
analysis concerning the need for
such decadent contraptions nor
who was drawing the benefits
from their production. Instead
what we are left with is a boring
monologue which could be
applied to the shape of a gas
pump hose. A grade Z attempt.
I am glad that your collect-
ive is reviewing its purpose
periodically. I think that the
paper should concern itself more
with political movement of
women than their sexual move-
ment. By this a great deal of
unity could be promoted con-
cerning the actual needs of the
broadest group of women. This
would be quite an achieve-
ment!!
Love,

Isolation

Dear Commonwoman,

I enjoy your newspaper and
I think you are doing a superb
job and I love you for it.

I am a woman in isolation
trying to raise two kids emotion-
ally alone... I have to begin some
kind of consciousness raising
group here in this wayward
town. This community is totally
male oriented and controlled
(where isn’t?). But the fact that
it is 98% Hispanic means so
much more. However essential
and basic is the main problem?
Urban vs. rural is also a part of
it.

Maneuverability, financial
independence and confidence is
the key towards freedom for
everybody. I am not well read,
so maybe this has all been said
before, but please do not forget
those of us who do not know
exactly where we are going.
However, I do know where I am
not going. That's a whole

different story — we have all
been there.

There has to be a better
world for the children — and the
mothers, who are women, etc.
and so on — “it’s the same old
story.”

I miss you, Burlington, and
the freedom I had with you.
Guard yourselves, my sisters.
Keep writing and thinking and
try to be balanced and unafraid.
I and others are with you and
behind and floating all around
you. We are part of each other —
all of us.

In health and strength,
Jean Sausville
Union City, N.J.

Farmer

Dear Friends,

I am wondering if you will
be able to help me solve a prob-
lem — I've been trying to locate
women’s farm communities in
the U.S. and have so far not had
any luck in obtaining addresses.
I want to get hooked up with
women farmers so that they may
help me in learning what to
expect as I start my own farm.

Working at farm and wild-
erness has been a great exper-
ience — but I need to put my
energy into women's work
projects. I’ve heard from friends
that there is a women’s farm in
Vermont, but they don’t know
where or how I could get in
touch with them. Do you know
of any? Thank you for your
help.

Feminist
Men

At the recent No-Nukes
benefit held at Nector’s, I made
an announcement about an
upcoming training session for
womyn interested in working
with Women Against Rape. I
also mentioned that for any
interested men, there is a Men
Against Rape group organizing
in Burlington. To my surprise (I
am shocked by my naive expec-
tations sometimes) I watched

Letters to the Editors —

Clearly as at least two dozen men
in the audience snickered, mum-
bled, laughed, nudged “com-
rades,”

These are the “alternative”
men, the “aware” men, the
“sensitive” men that so many of
my heterosexual sisters hastily
remind me of when my male-
anger comes out in conversation,
the men they defend, and laud. I
was not speaking that night to
any Burlington bar scene; I
was talking to a gathering of the
political alternative community.
I am angry at myself for not
responding immediately over the
microphone to such a disgusting
display of maleness. I am aware
that not all of the men in the
room responded so sickly, but
I want to know, where were those
men, why were they so quiet
while their “brothers” shone
forth such traditionally typical
male woman-hatred? Must it

always be the womyn who
patiently or angrily politicize
men?

I am sick of it, totally tired

and sick of it. I want to hear no
more of the “gentle, alternative,
feminist” men in this town until
I see those men taking some
risks to educate their ignorant
sex, until I see them nurturing
their feminist ideas for more
than the loving attention of
some one of my still heterosexual
sisters.

Vibrators
Redux

The article on vibrators is
reasonable on an intellectual
level. However, womin’s sexual-
ity, in this case, should not be
governed by an ideology. Part of
our struggle is to find the
freedom to explore and satisfy
ourselves. It is futile to pretend
that we are all “Politically
Correct” in our sexuality.

We are not all fortunate
enough to be lesbians with
perfect clitoral orgasms. Womin
who need the use of vibrators to
achieve an orgasm should not be
made to feel ashamed. We need
to express ourselves, not repress
ourselves. It is necessary to be
conscious of what we are doing.
However, it is absurd to deny
ourselves sexual gratification
over the use of a vibrator, which
we feel does not have sufficient
negative political consequences.
