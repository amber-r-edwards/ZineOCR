—Aneca Corvo  

By Jean C. Graveline  

Ruth and I were together  
two years. I can say with the  
assurance of the past that we  
were happy the first nine  
months; After that we took  
turns avoiding the issue our  
relationship had become  

Isn't it astonishing how  
much time one can put into lost  
causes, particularly lost loves?  
Most of us are taught to believe  
that ideal relationships last for-  
ever. Those that end are those  
that fail and failure is inadmissible.  
So we refuse it. We shrug  
off the inchoate discontent by  
reasoning that mature relation-  
ships can't possibly maintain  
their initial passion; it’s childish  
to think otherwise. We start  
making allowances; if there  
hasn’t been any lovemaking for  
three weeks it’s because of  
fatigue or tension or illness or  
cramps or the full moon or a  
restlessness that has nothing to  
do with anything. Such is life,  
we say.  

I said it many times, as I  
chopped tomatoes, as I got off  
the bus, as I made the bed. Ruth  

and I had entered a new and  
inevitable phase. Sometimes it  
even seemed preferable to that  
all-consuming fire at the onset,  
when I worried if I were witty  
enough, or if I smelled good,  
How exhausting it had been to  
constantly cover my bases. Now,  
if we wanted, we could be silent  
during an entire meal, and we  
could give each other reassuring  
little pats instead of long lost  
kisses before falling asleep. We  
could combine our laundry and  
not be embarrassed by occasional  
stains. We could confront one  
another's nudity without fearing  
judgment. We could admit to  
anything.  

Except our boredom,  
Ruth's increasing apathy was  
consistent with her nature: she  
abandoned all her projects after  
a predictable period of time.  
My personality, especially in  
regards to romance, is more  
passive. I tend to hang onto  
things, not out of desperation, I  
think but because I'm essentially  
complacent. I've never fallen out  
of love before I was forced to. It  
would be fine if both partners  
lost interest simultaneously.  
There'd be no need to feel guilty  
or awkward; you could almost  
laugh it off. Unfortunately,  
that’s not the pattern,  

I was losing appeal and I  
knew it. It was like being in a  
rowboat without oars. There was  
Ruth on the shore, looking at  
me, not doing anything. “Ruth,”  
I called, “Ruth,” but she just got  

implications of that phrase, what  
would be expected of me after  
uttering it. But I didn’t hold out  
for long. I was in love; it was my  
obligation as a lover to tell her.  

One image from those first  
weeks appears to me now: I used  
to open her closet just to see the  
way she arranged her shirts and  
shoes.  

It’s one thing to witness the  
gradual loss of passion. It’s quite  
another to be refused. I was  
being turned away with alarming  
consistency. It seemed that Ruth  
would watch for the glint in my  
eyes so that she could banish it.  
I'd cook an elaborate meal; we'd  
eat by candlelight; there’d be  
wine. She'd wait for me to make  
a move and then she’d complain,  
usually of an inability to relax,  
and I'd back up, my hands  
falling dumbly to my sides. A  
back rub, I'd offer, some tea.  
No, nothing.  

At first she'd temper these  
rejections with explanations,  
sometimes even apologies. But  
the more they occurred, the  
more frantic I became. I strug-  
gled for her acceptance. I  
whispered that I would wait. I  
was around every corner. I was  
hope itself, Naturally, she began  
to despise me.  

The mind will often register  
impressions without granting  
their reality. I saw every spiteful  
glance; I heard the resentment  
she stopped bothering to dis-  
guise. My faith remained intact.  
Occasionally, the idea of break-  
ing up would cross my mind; I  
even summoned it in an effort to  
feel the possible consequences.  
It held a terrible fascination for  
me, like being at the top of a  

cliff and staring down, swaying  
in the intoxicating danger. But  
a jumping off, like breaking up,  
was incomprehensible to me.  
This rift was her creation;  

I couldn't touch her, so that I could sleep.  
I felt her stiffen as my hand met  
her shoulder. “What do you  
want?” The words froze together  
in the darkness. “Nothing,” I said.  
She jerked her shoulder away.  
Minutes later, lying on my  
back with my eyes open, I  
decided to take the risk, to make  
a final plea for kindness. I  
turned onto my side and tucked  
myself around her back. I held  
my breath, Nothing happened.  
Then she kicked me — her heel  
struck my shin, hard. I knew  
that I'd remember it.  

I don't relate that episode  
to portray Ruth as an ogre.  
I gave her no choice; she had to  
humiliate. And even that didn’t  
work. I saw her behavior as a  
function of her confusion. She  
hadn't yet been pushed into the  
final corner, the one from which  
she could say, “I don’t love you  
anymore.”  

She went out one night to  
buy a present for a friend. I  
would have preferred a quiet  
interlude with her on the couch,  
a timeless interval in which we  
might find ourselves freed of  
past and present connections. I  
must have been exhausted by  
then: to live in the realm of  
hope is to be constantly vigilant.  
When the door clicked shut I  
leaned back in my chair and  
considered the cracks in the  
ceiling plaster. Was I missing  
some vital point?  

Four hours later Ruth  
returned, flushed and nervous.  
I noticed without surprise that she  
came in empty-handed. When she  
looked at me and started to cry  
I knew that she was leaving.  
I don’t remember what we said as  
she packed; I didn’t look up.  
I sat in the chair and watched my  
tears drop on the hardwood  
floor. All that had been sup-  
pressed and controlled for  
months closed around me — I  
felt small and defeated and alive,  
more alive than I'd felt in a year.  
It was happening, Ruth had  
broken the deadlock. “I'll be at  
June’s,” she said, kissing the top  
of my head, Then she left.  

The memory of that night  
makes me cringe — I've always  
considered myself more reser-  
ved. No one saw me pacing  
across the apartment, muttering  
to myself, crying till I choked.  
Four hours of that indulgence!  
Finally, I filled a juice glass with  
bourbon and took it to bed with  
an anthology of modern poetry.  
My eyes gazed out of focus, my  
thumb ruffled the pages. Ruth  
had slept here last night.  

Seeing the dawn sky meant  
that the worst was over. I drank  
coffee in bed and decided to do  
laundry. Nothing seemed so  
urgent as that full hamper in the  
bathroom. The fact that the  
laundromat was across the street  
from June’s apartment was inci-  
dental.  

All along one wall the  
dryers were tossing clothes: reds,  
stripes, whites, rolled over and  
over. On the other side, top-  
loading gold-toned washers  
churned the clothes that fed the  
dryers. Near the front of the  
room a young man sank quarters  
into the laundry aid panel; tiny  
boxes of soap descended. A  
change machine at the entrance  
made all this possible as it  
honked out shiny scoops of  
silver. Hum, chug, clink, honk —  
Bing Wong's would be here  
forever and ever: that comforted  
me.  

I separated my darks and  
whites and put my money in.  
Then I sidled up to the door and  
glanced at the front of June’s  
apartment building. There was  
Ruth’s truck parked on a side  
street. My heart kicked into my  
throat. I put my hand on my  
stomach, sat on a table near the  
door, and watched the building.  
Just before the dryer stopped,  
Ruth came out. I felt the  
blood rushing into my face as  
she walked to her truck. She's  
going to work, I thought,  
without me. She'll have to clean  
the whole place without my  
help. We had done janitorial  
work in a large office building.  
The pay was good, the hours  

short. We hadn't discussed  
who'd keep the job. Like so  
many other aspects of our  
relationship, it was resolved  
without consideration, the way  
one divines, after long associa-  
tion, who will call the repair  
shop, who will make the guacamole.  
Luckily, I had some money saved  
from a previous job; but I envied  
her this defined activity. I  
wondered what I'd do the rest of  
the day.  

Without thinking it, I ran  
out the door and onto the curb  
as Ruth pulled into the intersec-  
tion. Her mouth tightened; she  
waved and looked away.  
“Ruth,” I shouted. She dropped  
her head for a second and pulled  
over to the curb. I walked up to  
the truck, knowing I couldn't  
get in, knowing I had no rights  
to that seat anymore, no busi-  
ness even touching the door  
handle. I waited; she leaned over  
abruptly and rolled down the  
window. “Ruth,” I began and  
looked down at the curb. “I  
thought we could call this a trial  
separation. It would help me,  
kind of. You know.” She sighed.  
My fingers plucked at the lock  
“Okay.” I thought I saw her face  
soften. “That would be okay.”  

“Good," I replied and managed  
a smile. “Have a nice day" was  
all I could think to add. She  
nodded and drove off. I went  
inside to fold my clothes,  
acknowledging the futility of the  
request I'd just made, feeling,  
nonetheless, better.  

During that first week I  
took three or four baths a day.  
The hot water was an instant, if  
superficial, comfort. Usually,  
there was a drink on the side of  
the tub, a bright yellow screw-  
driver or a brassy bourbon.  
Drinking was easy. Eating  
wasn't. Operating always with  
good intentions, I'd cook some  
scrambled eggs and toast, but as  
soon as the food hit my palate  
my stomach would rise up  
threateningly and I'd have to  
spit it into a napkin. I swallowed  
vitamins instead.  

On the second morning I  
woke up with a stomach ache,  
which prevented me from doing  
the job hunting I'd intended. I  
wallowed in the sheets, tracing  
the pattern of their flowers with  
my index finger. A good friend  

stopped by.  
“You're never sick,” she  
said simply.  
“No, I’m not.”  

“Then you must realize that  
you're creating these stomach  
troubles. You don't want to  
work right now. You're afraid of  
any kind of involvement. So you  
get sick.”  

“I suppose you're right,”  
I mumbled into the pillow.  

“Try to relax. Kathy and I  
will pick you up tonight at 7:30.  
We'll go out to dinner, then  
maybe a movie. Okay?”  

“Dinner?”  

“Pizza. Listen. I have to  
go.” She paused. “We're all  
behind you, you know.  

And they were. My friends  
started coming out of the  
woodwork. At first it made me  
suspicious. I thought they might  
be pitying me, or feeling better  
about their own affairs because  
my life was so wretched. I  
couldn't imagine that anyone  
really enjoyed my company.  
Willingly, but with no will at all  
I allowed myself to be taken  
from one place to the next; the  
destination never mattered, nor  
the activity. Unmoved, I sat  
through sprawling musicals and  
bluegrass concerts and lots of  
grog at Solomon Grundy’s.  
When, on occasion, I'd start to  
laugh, it would frighten me — I  
couldn’t trust it; at least my  
tears were real. That was the  
worst thing about that time; I  
never really knew how I was  
doing.  

My days were wide-open  
and I filled them. Even the supermarket  
overwhelmed me with its rows  
and rows of selections, its  
dizzying array of odors. I'd  
stand stupidly before the tooth-  

pastes, trying to compare values,  
my eyes checking and rechecking  
all the ways to save. Looking  
at the wine cases I’d completely  
forgot which kinds I preferred.  
The feeling that my personality  
was missing struck me again and  
again as I walked around town.  
Did I like this bracelet or was it  
hideous? Did I want to go into  
the new culinary store? Weather,  
too, held no interest for me: rain  
was as good as sun.  

And my nights? I remember  
the clock’s red digits glowing  
1:55, 2:19, 3:27, like a friend,  
assuring me that time was indeed  
passing.  

No, I never called Ruth that  
week, I'd start to, then I'd hang  
up, not wanting to be a bother.  
Or I'd stop cold in the middle of  
dialing; suddenly convinced that  
she wasn’t tormented like me,  
that she wasn’t, at the moment,  
even thinking of me. Without  
being fully conscious of it, I was  
surviving. Our separation had  
thrown a spotlight on the  
relationship, forcing me to look  
and concede and carry on, even  
though our past dragged on  
the ground behind me. It was a  
matter
