Choices, by Nancy Toder, Persephone Press, $6.

“You are a strong woman,”  
my friend tells me. “You know  
that, don’t you?”

Do I? Do I see myself as  
strong, brave and true to myself,  
fighting the dragons, making  
sense of my life, a hero, of sorts?  
Without dreams, reality can turn  
quite drab. Without fantasy, our  
aspirations come to a crashing  
halt after the first hurdle.  
Without a rich cultural context  
to draw from, how can we grow?  
Without superheroes, a little  
larger than life perhaps, but  
grounded in our commonality,  
how can we expand into large-as-  
life human beings? Ever since  
Nancy Drew, that competent  
WASP whose roadster always  
worked when she hopped into it  
to follow a clue, there haven’t  
been many believable heroines  
to admire.

In Sandy Stein of Choices,  
by Nancy Toder, we have a hero  
to identify with, whose main  
heroic act is to be true to her  

COMMON WOMAN MARCH/APRIL,  

lesbian “feelings.” Sandy Stein  
“comes out” of our shared  
history: the repression which  

began to end in this last decade,  
but which continues. As we  
awaken, to reveal itself, ever  
more obviously, as “the hetero-  
sexual assumption.” Sandy Stein  
is truly fictional; she never  
falters, never denies her feelings;  
she insists, as a grown woman  
and a professional, to be “out.”  
If this doesn’t strike you as  
heroic, then make sure you take  
this book with you to work, and  
leave its cover exposed to view  
by your associates. If you for a  
moment falter, then there are  
dragons lying in wait right now,  
for you to slay.

Sandy’s counterpart is her  
clandestine college lover, Jenny,  
the one who was afraid of those  
overpowering lesbian feelings,  
who settled for security. Ten  
years later, she stands before us  
looking lost in her heterosexual  
privilege, swallowed whole by  
what she swallowed.

It is most certainly a joy  
and a relief for a change to see  
things from the perspective of  
the fulfilled dyke. For once the  
burden to prove fulfillment is on  
the shoulders of the hetero-  
sexual woman. It is her barren  
reality that is challenged. The  
novel's believability lies in the  
fact that we meet the characters  
when they are in college, at a  
turning point that every woman  
and certainly every dyke can

REVIEW INEWS  

remember. Dynamic Sandy Stein  
began as a recalcitrant misfit.  
Jenny, who was so eager to  
please, has let herself get severed  
from her center.

This piece of fiction, so  
firmly grounded in honest  
remembering, succeeds because  
of its honesty. Psychotherapy’s  
tools work well to give voice to  
the meanest thoughts as well as  
the most lusciously lesbian ones.  
Is coming out a cure for lying in  
all departments? The book takes  
me back to the romance of  
college days, when the blood  
rushed to my head every time  
my friend looked at me, and yet  
I didn’t dare call her the love of  
my life. I find myself reliving my  
earliest revelations upon coming  
out, when all the women I had  
so furtively watched, admired,  
or befriended and loved, rose  

out of the bog of forgotten  
memory to take their places of  
significance in my life.

Choices is a cathartic experi-  
ence for so many of us who have  
struggled so hard without the  
time to give ourselves credit for  
achieving the lives we now enjoy  
as strong and free lesbians! It is  
only through the luxury of  
culture, represented in this case  
by a “novel of lesbian love,”  
that we get the chance to sit  
back and beam lovingly at our  
self reflected in a hero, sane and  
lovable, who transforms her  
anger into power to express  
herself. How good to see the  
lesbian choice as positive and  
self-fulfilling, and the hetero-  
sexual choice as self-effacing, as  
so many of us have found it to  
be.

Finally, I must ask myself,  
is Sandy Stein really larger than  
life, or is she not the woman  
I have become? Her life, her way,  
is not unattainable. Why put  
limits on the potential places  
our courage can take us? Sandy  
is a woman given the chance to

come to terms with her past and  
forge her future, free of the self-  
deprecating monologue that has  
been intoning itself in our  
female heads for centuries.  
Choices reflects the bravery of  
its author; it is far from perfect  
in its artistry, but it is an honest  
attempt at the possibility of  
heroism in our lives.

Nuke Handbook

By Maxine Merrick  
Ain't Nowhere We Can Run: A  
Handbook for Women on the  
Nuclear Mentality, Susan Koen  
and Nina Swaim, Women  
Against Nuclear Development, $2.50.

With the nuclear moratorium  
issue on several town ballots  
March 3, Vermont women  
should know there is a way to  
understand the real and present  
dangers of nuclear proliferation  
in the home, family, individual  
and workplace, no matter where  
you live and work.

Susan Koen and Nina  
Swaim have written and pub-  

Ain't Nowhere We Can  
Run: A Handbook for Women  
on the Nuclear Mentality to  
focus “in particular on the  
connections between the nuclear  
proliferation of power plants,  
with women and nature.”

The Handbook began as  
women from Vermont and New  
Hampshire began to gather and  
explore the connections between  
patriarchy, feminism and nuclear  
development. It is a function of  
Women Against Nuclear Deve-  
lopment (WAND), a feminist  
collective which has been meet-  
ing since summer, 1979.

Ain't Nowhere... is  
thoroughly enlightening, not  
only for women who want to  
understand the relationship of  
feminism to nuclear power  
plants, but for any person who  
wants to know the reality of  
what is “nuclear” and how  
important it should be to all of  
us.

Koen, Swaim and collective  
members who helped compile  
information have tried to give  
readers an idea of how women  
and children especially will be  
affected by a build-up of  
“nuclearness” in America. They  
are not saying that men will not  
be affected, but the point of the  
handbook is that anything  
nuclear is male-dominated  
machinery — that society is  
characterized by the dominance  
of male-defined constructs.

The Handbook identifies  
the duality of society on the  
social, psychological, political  
and economic levels. This unfor-  
tunately means, on each of those  
levels, identifying characteristics  
of people, places and things as  
being preferable because they  
hold male qualities or as being  
undesirable because they hold  
female qualities.

Koen and Swaim believe  
that nuclear proliferation has  
male characteristics, therefore it  
is readily accepted by society  
without being thoroughly ana-  
lyzed and scrutinized by the  
public in general.

The authors explain nuclear  
terms normally unfamiliar to  
most people and give a break-  
down and diagram of how and  
where radiation affects the  
female body. The effects of  

nuclear development on women  
and children are much more  
dangerous than the effects on  
men, according to Koen and  
Swaim. They cite the Rasmussen  
Report on pregnant women and  
young children evacuated from  
Three Mile Island in March,  
1979, as an example.

The Handbook also covers  
the political and economic  
effects of nuclear development.  
It explains the relationship of  
nuclear power to the “energy  
crisis,” to unemployment  
because nuclear power is a  
“labor-saving” industry, and to  
the centralization of power in  
government because only a few  
people understand and control  
the development of nuclear  
plants and weapons.

The second half of Ain't  
Nowhere We Can Run is devoted  
to women speaking out, such as  
Karen Silkwood, Grace Paley,  
Winona La Duke and Holly  
Near, who wrote the song from  
which the title of the book was  
taken.

The Handbook also gives  
future directions for women  
fighting the nuclear mentality, a  
guide to what can and should be  
accomplished to achieve a non-  
nuclear America and a guide to  
resources and organizations  
against nuclear proliferation.

Anna Gyorgy, author of No  
Nukes: Everyone’s Guide to  
Nuclear Power, calls the Hand-  
book “An excellent and needed  
contribution for women who  
want to understand and act.”
