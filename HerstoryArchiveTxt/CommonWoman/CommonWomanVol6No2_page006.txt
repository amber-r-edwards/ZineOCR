Incest: A Daughter and

Mother Speak

By Sarah and Elizabeth

The following is an edited
transcript of a conversation
between a daughter and mother
about father/daughter incest.
The names “Sarah” and “Eliza-

beth” are pseudonyms... The
women are white and middle
class; Sarah is in her early
twenties and Elizabeth is in her
forties.

Sarah says: “The problem
with my father started when I
was 14 and had just begun my
first year in high school. Dad
and Mother were having serious
marital difficulties, which I knew
about through constant violent arguments. I had just recently begun to bud
sexually and had just begun to
do some sexual experimenting.

“At the same time, my
mother became seriously ill and
was in and out of the hospital all
during my ninth-grade year; I
think she spent about half
of that year in the hospital. It
might have been the first time
she was hospitalized that Dad
first made sexual advances to
me; my memory of that time
is somewhat jumbled.

“I think that during my first
semester in high school, Dad
tried to have intercourse with
me about three times, always
when Mother was in the hospi-
tal. He would be massaging me —
which he had always done when
my muscles were sore — and
then he'd suddenly be fondling
my breasts. Or I'd be kissing him
goodnight and he’d grab me and
start French-kissing me. I managed to get away each time and
run to my room. My brothers
were always away from home
when this happened — Dad and I
would be alone in the house, a
situation which I came to dread.

“Because of all the emo-
tional upheaval, I became heavily
involved with drugs and
casual sex. I also started skipping
school for extended periods and
ran away from home several
times; I always ended up going
back home and trying to face
what was there, because I really
had no place else to go.

“Probably the most humiliating
thing Dad did to me during
this period happened when I got
caught skipping school the
second time: He'd been very
angry the first time I was caught
and he was even angrier when it
happened again. He took me
into my bedroom and forced me
to strip naked and look at
myself in the mirror while he
went on and on about, ‘Oh, look
at this beautiful body that
you're just throwing away on
every guy you can get. Look at
how you’re destroying your
mind with every drug you can
get.’ He kept it up for almost an
hour while I was cringing with
shame and fear.

“For some reason — perhaps
because I was so obviously
repulsed by his advances — he
finally stopped trying to force
himself on me, but he continued
to harass me verbally. He
couldn’t understand why I
wouldn't have intercourse with
him when I was ‘acting like a
whore’ with other guys. When I

fault; we are not alone.

Below is a partial listing of
recent books on incest:

The Best Kept Secret: The
Sexual Abuse of Children, by
Florence Rush, 1980. Historical
perspective, mostly European-
American cultural outlook, in-
cluding religion, Freud, film,
literature.

The Silent Children: A

because it was 90 degrees
outside he thought that I was
deliberately ‘enticing’ him.

“I’m not sure why I didn’t
tell Mother about all this at the
time. Maybe I thought she
wouldn’t understand, or maybe I
was afraid Dad would punish me
— maybe even kill me — if I told.
I struggled with it alone until it
finally became too much for
me.

ELIZABETH: Toward the
end of your ninth-grade year, we
were all in counseling together
for a few weeks — you and Dad
and I — and you told the coun-
selor and me what had been
happening.

SARAH: The therapist
asked me if I was having any
problems with you or Dad, and I
said that, well, I could think of
one thing in particular that was
bothering me about Dad, and
then the therapist questioned me
further and I explained what had
happened. And Dad's first reac-
tion was, “Oh, this great weight
has been lifted off my chest!”

ELIZABETH: I don’t
remember it that way. I remem-
ber his first reaction as being,
“Oh, no, I didn’t do that.”
Anyway, after that session with
the therapist, your father never
“came on" to you again, did he?

SARAH: No. We stopped
having any kind of physical
contact, really, except that we
kept up a normal, goodnight-kiss
relationship, probably so that it
wouldn't look as though there
were anything wrong to any-
body else.

ELIZABETH: I've read
that the most common form of incest
is father/daughter; the most
uncommon kind of incest is
mother/son. But I didn’t know
much about incest before I
found out what had been
happening to you. I was very
naive, I didn't even think about
your father ever making advan-
ces to you.

SARAH: I remember the
conflict you had when you
found out. You had always said
that you thought the thing you
would do if you ever found
out that someone was abusing
your children was that you'd
become like a mother bear and
attack the person.

ELIZABETH: If someone
raped my children or tormented
them in any way, I would be
quite capable of killing the
person who did it. But I never
thought of my own husband as
being a molester. It bothers me a
lot when people say that the
mother knows what's going on,
but ignores it because she’s
financially dependent on the
husband, or because she doesn’t
want her husband to bother her
sexually, so it’s fine if he bothers
his daughter sexually. I get very
angry when I hear comments
like that, because financial
dependence or wanting to be left
alone sexually would not lead
me to want my daughter to be
molested. What bothered me most
about the whole situation was
I had always thought of
“home” as being a place where
you're safe. There’s the outside
world — school and all that.

ABOUT INCEST

By Euan Bear

Parent’s Guide to the Prevention
of Child Sexual Abuse, by Linda
Tschirhart Sanford, 1980. High-
ly recommended. Linda keeps
placing the responsibility for the
abuse where it belongs — on the
perpetrator/offender, not on the
other parent or the child.
Written to help parents deal with
their kids openly about sexual
abuse.

Conspiracy of Silence: The
Trauma of Incest, by Sandra
Butler, 1978. Discusses dyna-
mics of incestuous families and
professional response.

Kiss Daddy Goodnight: A
Speakout on Incest, by Louise
Armstrong, 1978. Recommended
with caution. Armstrong
interviewed over 150 victims for
this book, and it’s important to
hear the stories. The caution
concerns two aspects. Armstrong
apparently has an unarticulated
list of values against which she
measures the (former) victims’
success in dealing with the incest
experience, which shows in her
descriptions of them. If you're
fat or not attached to a man or
don't have children, Armstrong
seems to be saying that you're
not dealing successfully with the
experience. The second caution
involves her tone, which at times
felt flippant.

Father's Days: A True Story
of Incest, by Katherine Brady,
1979. “Brady” is a pseudonym,
but otherwise the book is a true
account of her own experience.
Sometimes painful to read for
victims because of its explicit
sexual detail. Caution: Brady
seems to want to hold her
mother responsible for her
father’s acts because Mother
took a job which made her
unavailable for sex with her
husband.
