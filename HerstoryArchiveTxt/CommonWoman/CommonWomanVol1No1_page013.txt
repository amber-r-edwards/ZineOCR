Seabrook

formation of a network of
womyn against nuclear power,
and in the composition of a
feminist statement expressing
the views of many womyn, that
nuclear power is a product of a
power hungry, male dominated
society.

WHY AN OCCUPATION?

Powerful forces, including this
government, have learned to
tolerate and dismiss
demonstrations. The point of
the Seabrook occupation/restor-
ation was to seize the site with
thousands of people and refuse
to leave. In West Germany some
20,000 people took such an
action and forced a permanent
halt to construction of a nuke
there. The site is now a town
powered by alternative forms of
sun and wind energy. There were
people occupying Seabrook who
were prepared to “live” there a
year, some longer. Apparently
the New Hampshire Public
Service Comm. and the governor
feared the success of such an
action and made the offer of a
legal, 4-day demonstration. Due
in part to pressure on local
landowners who were
sympathetic to Clamshell (the
anti-nuke alliance) and who were
contributing use of their land for
parking and camping, the New
Hampshire Clamshell group
accepted the proposal and the
Occupation dissipated into a
4-day very tolerable
demonstration. I still feel that a
permanent occupation is a
necessity to stop construction.

DYKES AGAINST NUKES

Ten Burlington area womyn
trained as an affinity group and
traveled to the Seabrook
demonstration. We are lesbian
feminists, of varied backgrounds,
lifestyles and occupations and
we went to Seabrook to fight
with other people, men as well
as womyn, against an evil that
threatens all of us, separatists
included. We went, under the
banner “DYKE POWER”,
thinking that we could/would
join forces with all of the other
anti-nuke forces and with our
numbers demonstrate our
power.

We realized soon after our
arrival at our campsite that we
felt alienated from the mostly
middle-class, hippie-leftist male
process and energy there. There
was too much of a feeling that
to them nuclear power was THE
issue, an isolated instance, or at
best, a product of capitalism. We
womyn feel that nuclear power
is only a symptom of a male
powered technology and
probably a predecessor of worse
things to come. So we marched
onto the site, occupied a space
for our circle of tents and
announced our presence with
the dyke power banner in the
trees and a notice at the central
communications tent that our
campsite was a WOMYN’S
SPACE for meeting, talking,
herbal first-aid, rape crisis, and
gynecological help. We called a
meeting for that night for
womyn interested in and
needing to connect with other
womyn at Seabrook — that first
night about 30 of us sang songs
and shared some of our
herstories. We learned of a large
gathering of womyn from all
over Massachusetts who were
meeting in a nearby town and
talking about the larger

ramifications of nuclear power
and how they too felt alienated
from the demonstration forces.
We planned to meet with these
womyn on Sunday morning
when they were expected to
arrive at the site. On that
morning I walked through the
woods to their campsite. Under
a huge banner: “WOMAN
SPACE” sat over 70 womyn, in
a circle, talking. It was a
powerful feeling for me, and for
once in those days at Seabrook,
I felt like I understood why I
was there.

Nuclear power plants, fueled
with enriched uranium, create
radioactive by-products which,
in low doses, can cause cancer,
genetic damage and premature
aging, while higher doses cause
radiation poisoning which often
results in sterility and death. In
addition, atomic reactors
produce plutonium, a substance
so deadly that one millionth of a
gram can cause fatal lung cancer.
The nuclear industry mines,
mills, and attempts to ship these
radioactive substances and store
them. In the U.S. alone, millions
of gallons of radioactive wastes
have accumulated; these wastes
must be kept out of the
environment for 250,000 years.
The rich men who build, operate

and profit from nuclear power —

plants have not yet figured out
what to do with the incredible
amount of deadly waste, so they

NUCLEAR POWER IS A
MAN’S PRODUCT

In talking for over an hour we
shared our feelings that nuclear
power is a product of a male
controlled culture which
dominates rather than co-exists.
This culture that stresses male
values of competition, power
and dominance shows contempt
for “lesser” species, a need to
conquer and control. We see the
natural resources wastefully
consumed in a rape of the earth
analogous to man’s raping of
womyn; nature and womyn both
at the claws of men’s power lust.

Nuclear power is a product of
a male dominated technological
society. In this society, the
discovery of powerful things like
nuclear energy do not raise the
questions “should we use it?” or
“do we know enough?” but
instead, in a race to “be the
most powerful” or “have the
most control,” nuclear weapons
are stockpiled, the atom bomb is
dropped, and nuclear power
plants spring up everywhere
before any real sense of how to
deal with the effects is ever
understood.

Men not only fight to control
our lives (aspirations, time,
sexuality) through personal
relationships, but they make
ultimate choices about our
safety as we, without choice,
become victims of their power
wars and technology races. We
must stop their products and we
must, through the reeducation
of our boy children, stop the
further development of this
power hungry, raping, male
mentality.

WOMYN FORM A
NETWORK

This is, ultimately, what
nuclear power is all about and
why we, the seventy or more
womyn at that morning meeting,
could not openly join with the
rest of the people there in their
demonstration against the nukes.
We formed a network of womyn
against nuclear power which in
essence is a communications
network among dozens of
autonomous groups of womyn.
We plan to put out a newsletter
in which we share with each
other the work we are all doing,
directly and indirectly fighting
nuclear power which is
essentially a product of
patriarchal power. We wrote a
statement that morning which
we were determined to read for
the thousands who were
gathered wide-eyed at Jackson
Browne and Arlo Guthrie
(Occupation??). We marched,

SOME BACKGROUND ON NUCLEAR POWER

pile up in trenches and concrete
blocks; the list of leaks and
contamination is long and
incredible. Fires within plants
pose constant threats of a
nuclear core meltdown. Such an
accident in a large plant
(Seabrook, for example) would
cause death and acute illness
within twenty miles, with latent
cancers, thyroid illnesses and
land and water contamination to
within 50 miles. (The likelihood
of immediate evacuation of
hundreds of thousands of people
is slight.) There is also the
possibility of accident during the
transport of nuclear materials on
highways and railways.
Accidents have occurred in
plants across the nation, and
radioactive air leaks and water
spills have occurred at Millstone,

singing “Move on over or we'll

move on over you,” our
numbers increasing as we walked
behind banners “Woman Space”
and “Dykes Against Nukes” to
the stage where we demanded
microphone time. Refused it due
to a “crowded schedule,” we
continued under the rope and
toward the stage in a show of
force that felt necessary and
wonderful. We were granted the
time, told Arlo he had to wait,
and five of us “occupied” the
stage and read this, our
collective statement:

Nuclear power is a feminist
and lesbian issue. The struggle
against the rape of our earth by
rich white males is the same as
our struggle against the rape of
our bodies and our lives.
Alternative energy sources
controlled by the people are
what we need. We do not see
one complex, centralized,
profit-oriented solar collector, or
the hierarchy which Clamshell is
moving toward, as much of an
improvement over nuclear
technology. We women, who are
the primary childraisers, must
teach our children not to
dominate the earth, but rather
to live cooperatively with it. We
must start at our children’s
births to look for ways to get rid
of the sex roles which encourage
boys to be overpowering and
girls to be passive. We must not
let our fear of homosexuality
keep us from this task. We reject
the overbearing male ego's love
of elitism and power.

Nuclear power is a clear and
blatant illustration of centralized
power. As we struggle against
nuclear power, we also struggle

against this centralization. We
must take back our power at its
source — within each of us and
in small autonomous groups.

We will stop nuclear power
with women’s energy by
utilizing the strengths and skills
of every individual woman and
our collective strength. This
weekend lesbians and feminists
have come to Seabrook to
connect with women and
establish the beginnings of a
network with women against
nuclear power. We would like to
meet women who want to work
with women against nuclear
power. Write: Women Against
Nuclear Power, c/o Second
Wave, P.O. 344, Cambridge,
Mass 02139.

Thousands (20) were there,
and it was silent but for the
woman reading. Some men
jeered — we ignored them. As we
left the stage, the rest of our
womyn’s group stood and sang

accidental releases of radioactive
materials from commercial
reactors in the U.S. Aside from
the human risk and damage, the
irreversible environmental
damage to land and waterways is
tremendous.

So why do nukes continue to
be built, operated and
encouraged by power companies
and big corporations? Electric
utilities make a fixed percentage
on every dollar they invest.
Nukes are attractive to private
utilities because their rates are
based on the amount of capital
invested in generating facilities.
Therefore, the more the plant
costs, the higher the rate the
consumer pays. They raise our
electric bill (rate) and we pay to
build and run these deadly
plants.

and left too. Many womyn
clapped and cheered, many were
afraid, many angry. Arlo Guthrie
took over then and entertained,
and we, feeling our input at
Seabrook was finally complete,
left.

Author's Note

In the past few years I have
done a lot of thinking about the
sexism inherent in “our” language
and I have spent time
researching word origins and
meanings. This language work
has strongly indicated that the
power imbalance between men
and womyn is supported by the
language that men have created
for us to speak, and entrap
ourselves with. Therefore, a
most obvious word, WOMEN,
which is used to identify us,
contains “MEN” as part of it. I
reject this. In this article and
elsewhere — when I write
“women” or womyn, I have
changed the spelling (learning to
take power over my language as
I try to in the rest of my life) to
reflect on a literal level my belief
that womyn exist and grow
strong and supportive without
the necessary inclusion of

“man” or “men” in our words
or lives.

“No society in which healthy
adult women are employed to
wear tiny gold shorts and shake
pompoms during a soccer game
can claim to be shedding its
patriarchal world view with
much enthusiasm.”
