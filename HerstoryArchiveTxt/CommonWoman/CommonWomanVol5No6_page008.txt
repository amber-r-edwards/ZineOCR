El Salvador

Condensed by Nancy Powell  
The major news sources in  
this country are not telling us  
the truth about El Salvador and,  
incidentally, about many other  
countries. This is because, in the  
words of Lawrence Chappelle,  
“television news directors have  
decided you aren’t interested in  
the day-to-day terror of the  
Salvadoran people.” Chappelle,  
who was there in early 1981, has  
written an account of what it is  
really like in El Salvador, and  
what it is like to be hampered  
at every turn by a supposedly  
objective, truth-seeking major  
network. Some excerpts follow:  
... We cover our first story,  
(of) the monsters who operate at  
night. The bodies of their  
victims are randomly distributed  
throughout the streets of San  
Salvador — one on the steps of  
the national cathedral, another  
in front of the U.S. Embassy,  
three more dumped into the  
hallway of a building in barrio  
Mejicanos. Bodies of poor peo-  
ple, of leftists, of church people,  
of intellectuals, and of people  
who just had the misfortune to  
be caught outside after curfew.  
This is a scene I am to witness  
virtually every day I am in El  
Salvador: thumbs torn off; ribs  
caved in and, always, half a  
face missing; women raped;  
throats cut until the head  
dangles from a few unsevered  
muscles. When the body is  
removed part of the face “falls  
away or hangs by the nose.  
Anyone can kill, but this is truly  
the work of monsters. ...We  
follow the bodies to the ceme-  
tery... divided into three sec-  
tions, for the rich, the middle  
class and one section for those  
too poor to afford a burial plot.  
In this last section, we are told,  
the graves are dug so shallow  
that at night the dogs dig the  
bodies up and eat them.  
According to the bureau  
chief, there are no stories here.  
No one cares about the war or  
dead bodies. The only reason we  
are here is because the other  
networks are here, and the only  
reason anybody is here is  
because of alleged communist  
support for the Popular Forces.  
The only stories left to be done  
here are an attack on the U.S.  
Embassy, the death of a U.S.  
military advisor, a right-wing  
coup or the arrest of the killers  
of the American nuns; we are  
told, “we’re only interested in  
bodies if they're white and  
English-speaking.”  
Chappelle, a soundman, and  
the rest of the crew go to a  
refugee camp even though their  
boss tells them, “we've done a  
hundred refugee stories, the  
American people aren't inter-  
ested in refugees.” He writes, “I  
am overwhelmed by the misery  
that we see here.” He submits  
the tamest story he can manage,  
including the information that  
doctors who provide free care to  
the refugees are murdered by the  
right wing, that the camp  
director, a nun, “prefers to dress  
in civilian clothing, believing it  
makes her less of a target for  
right-wing assassins.” The story  
doesn’t make the air. An inter-  
view with an upper-class couple  
does.  

Later. “Today the bodies of  
thirty people are found on one  
street in Suyapongo. As there is  
intense competition for the  
bodies between the various  
funeral homes, only one of the  
networks gets there early enough  
to film the bodies before they  
are removed. F. (a colleague)  
and I travel to several funeral  
homes, filming the bodies wait-  
ing to be identified. I find  
myself asking, ‘why am I really  
here?” and getting no answer. So  
I ask myself other questions like,  
what do you do when they come  
for you in the middle of the  
night? When there’s a knock on  
the door and your name is called  
out? Do you resist, taking the  
easy bullet, and forfeit the lives  
of your husband, your wife,  
children, loved ones? Of course  
not. And so you go outside with  
them alone. And when does the  
rain of blows begin? When your  
thumbs are tied behind your  
back, when a blindfold is slipped  
over your head, when a rag is  
stuffed down your throat  
drowning out even your screams.  
And when does oblivion come?”  

“In Suchitoto, the mili-  
tary headquarters for Cuscatlan  
province, we encounter that rare  
commodity, an English-speaking  
sound bite. A West Point trained  
Lieutenant wants to make a  
personal appeal to the American  
public for continued aid in the  
struggle against communist  
tyranny. We are filming the  
unloading by soldiers of army  
trucks full of food donations  
from U.S. and Canada intended  
for refugees, at the time, and ask  
him to speak off camera, think-  
ing that the bureau will never  
use an interview that isn’t  
conducted by one of their  
reporters. After he had finished  
his spiel, “we need more non-  
lethal aid such as flares so we  
won't have to kill so many  
innocent civilians when we fight  
at night,” we asked him why the  
army was stockpiling food  
intended for refugees. His ex-  
planation was that the army is  
protecting the food from being  
stolen by leftists and that  
eventually the soldiers would  
pass it on to a refugee camp  
nearby. His commanding officer  
obligingly rounded up some  
townspeople so that we could  
film the army handing out food  
to refugees... We knew that not  
only was the army not giving  
them (refugees) food but would  
periodically enter the camp,  
accuse a handful of refugees of  
being leftists, take them out and  
shoot them.”  

Chappelle et al are trying to  
get information about a mas-  
sacre of civilians by the army.  
The reporter he is with stupidly  
asks the first person he sees in a  
village about the murders. “The  
man he asks turns out to be a  
member of ORDEN (a “civilian  
rural death squad that receives  
arms, food and clothing through  
military channels”), which  
should have been obvious, since  
he has an M-1 and is wearing  
U.S.-issue jungle boots... They  
are arrested. “The only thing  
that takes the edge off my fear is  
my anger at seeing these mother-  
fuckers wearing U.S. army  
boots. Is this Reagan’s idea of  
non-lethal aid, providing boots  
for these monsters who kill  
defenseless people?” They are  
released.  

Chappelle is especially vul-  
nerable to being killed by the  
army and right-wing paramilitary  
squads because he is black and  
usually assumed to be Cuban  
and working with the Popular  
Front.  

It is impossible in a short  
space to convey the stupidity  
and triviality, savagery and indif-  
ference that the author encoun-  
ters among fellow news agents  
and politicians, both U.S. and  
Salvadoran. To say that human  
values are lacking and priorities  
wildly misplaced in the perfor-  
mance of the U.S. government  
and media in Third World  
countries like El Salvador, is to  
understate. We are being served  
palatable lies in place of truth.

The Colonel  

(Reprinted with permission from Pedquod)  

What you have heard is true. I was in his house. His wife  
carried a tray of coffee and sugar. His daughter filed her nails,  
his son went out for the night. There were daily papers, pet dogs,  
a pistol on the cushion beside him. The moon swung bare on its  
black cord over the house. On the television was a cop show. It  
was in English. Broken bottles were imbedded in the walls around  
the house to scoop the kneecaps from a man’s legs or cut his hands  
to lace. On the windows there were gratings like those in liquor  
stores. We had dinner, rack of lamb, good wine, a gold bell was on  
the table for calling the maid. The maid brought green mangoes,  
salt, a type of bread. I was asked how I enjoyed the country. There  
was a brief commercial in Spanish. His wife took everything away.  
There was some talk then of how difficult it had become to govern.  
The parrot said hello on the terrace. The colonel told it to shut up,  
and pushed himself from the table. My friend said to me with his  
eyes: say nothing. The colonel returned with a sack as is used to  
bring groceries home. He spilled many human ears on the table.  
They were like dried peach halves. There is no other way to say this.  
He took one of them in his hands, shook it in our faces, dropped it  
into a water glass. It came alive there. I am tired of fooling around,  
he said. As for the rights of anyone, tell your people they can go  
fuck themselves. He swept the ears to the floor with his arm and held  
the last of his wine in the air. Something for your poetry, no? he said.  
Some of the ears on the floor caught this scrap of his voice. Some of  
the ears on the floor were pressed to the ground.
