sections, vocal choruses, cellos  
(you name it) all are possibilities

Norma Kwestel on drums, Meri  
Furnari (Mica) on marimba,  
percussion and vocals, Organa on  
guitar, keyboards, banjo and

keyboards, guitar and vocals.

woman wishing to work with the  
band should contact one of the  
band members. Call 879-7881.
