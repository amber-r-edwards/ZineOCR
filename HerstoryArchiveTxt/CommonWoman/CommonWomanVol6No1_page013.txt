EWP  
(Continued from Page 1)  

Many women felt there was  
not enough time given to talking  
through these issues. It certainly  
would take more than the fifty  
minutes allotted to air all the  
aspects of these community  
concerns. Hopefully EWP will  
encourage another or several  
other meetings to take place on  
these subjects.  

The final topic of the  
evening was the future of EWP.  
Most talk here was of the desire  
to do more outreach and bring  
in an ever more diverse group of  
women. Also discussed were  
some of the barriers to doing  
that such as the lack of staff.  
Again the time was short and it  

was somewhat frustrating to  
only be able to broach the  
subject.  

It would seem that if EWP  
truly is concerned with commu-  
nity feedback they might allot a  
bit more space for things to be  
talked out. The place is efficient-  
ly run and this is a good quality  
but can become a misplaced  
value if the interests of effi-  
ciency override the concerns of  
the women intended to be  
served by EWP.  

All in all though EWP is  
doing a wonderful job and  
women should celebrate its  
presence. We need to understand  
too, that all of us make EWP  
happen and that it is not a fixed,  
unmovable institution but a  
growing, evolving activity center  
and reflects back what women  
are putting into it.

A whole vote has also been  
cast by the traditional Peace  
Churches — the Quakers, the  
Mennonites, Hutterites and  
others have refused to pay  
war taxes during the French-  
Indian War, the Revolutionary  
War and the Civil War.  

Paij: Is there literature avail-  
able on this network?  

Lori: Sure. You can write to  
Peacemakers, Box 627 in Gar-  
berville, California. I believe the  
zip is 95440.  

Paij: What is the Central  
Vermont War Tax Conversion  
Effort presently involved in?  

Lori: Well, on Saturday,  
January 30, from 10 to 5, we'll  
be sponsoring a TR Clinic. We  
will get into the history, philo-  
sophy of TR; and conduct  
“how to” workshops, do coun-  
selling, distribute literature, do  
outreach. The Clinic will cul-  
minate in a potluck and we'll  
have a benefit the night before  
with contra-dancing. Like Emma  
Goldman said, “if there’s no  
dancing at the revolution, I’m  
not coming.”  

There’s so much we can do  
as a support group. We have an  
“alternative fund"... an entity  
that uses withheld taxes and  
allocates them to life-saving,  
human causes. We will be giving  
loans to local groups working in  
health, education, housing; Viet-  
nam vets, women and child  
abuse programs. Oh yes, and we  
will do research into non-violent  
conflict resolution. We'll involve  
ourselves with international  
peace exchanges and peace edu-

half after the date the new  
funding was to begin. Nothing  
comes out of the Commission  
Office about battered women. It  
is not just the wasted money,  
but... battered women across the  
state, and the Coalition Against  
Domestic Violence, have been  
silenced. The Commission has  
said, “We didn’t hire an advo-  
cate."  

It is crystal clear what kind  
of energy they don’t want. They  
couldn’t control me. They hired  
someone who had no experience  
with battered women’s problems  
and no experience with the  
Coalition. She had no experience  
and they can control her because  
of that, and not offend.  

CW: Would the name  
“Governor’s Commission On the  
Status of People” be more  
appropriate?  
Deane: They show little  
consciousness... little awareness  
about the day-to-day goings on  
in the life of the battered  
woman. The Commission was  
made up solely of Republicans.  
Gretchen Morse this summer did  
suggest that at least one Demo-  
crat be appointed to the Board  
so the Board would not look so  
partisan. Yes, the name should  
definitely be changed — perhaps  
then expectations of them  
would be different.  

CW: What is the future like  
for Battered Women in the  
State?  

Deane: Well, funding is  
happening, through the efforts  
of the Coalition. The Coalition  
received a $15,000 grant from  
MS Foundation so that we're  
able to hire a part-time coordi-  
nator and a part-time fundraiser,  
and provide some needed con-  
tinuity. And other groups are  
getting funded, too. We can  
certainly use more funding. The  
Coalition has set up a ‘Deane  
Brittingham Defense Fund’ and  
proceeds (other than court ex-  
penses) will go to the Coalition  
Against Domestic Violence to  
support our ongoing work. So  
we're still building. However,  
many many women are being  
battered. Nationally, at least one  
woman is being battered every  
18 seconds. We will have more  
access to media with a coordina-  
tor. It will be easier to get  
recognition with the consis-  
tency, continuity, and follow-up  
efforts of the coordinator. A few  
people ask, “isn’t it better  
working financially independent  
of the institutions?” but I see  
that as a cop-out. Battering is a  
public issue and everyone's  
responsibility.

them only as “the enemy.” In  
times of revolt, the ones who  
begin to act are often the young  
people raised in “privileged”  
upper-middle class homes. They  
can most clearly realize that  
money and material possessions  
are not the things in life that  
give joy or satisfaction. White  
people sometimes fight back out  
of cultural impoverishment and  
boredom... Doris Davenport says  

of this phenomenon:  
“A few of us even see beyond  
the ‘so-called privilege of being  
white, and perceive white women  
as very oppressed, and  
ironically, invisible.”  

Rosario Morales adds: “Color  
and class don’t define people or  
politics.”  

This is not to deny that  
many people’s reality does take  
on a “class” flavor, or that  
racism does exist. On the con-  
trary, it’s because there are  
so many kinds of oppression  
that I emphasize the need for a  
more all-encompassing ideology,  
and warn against allowing liberal  
guilt to have the power to keep  
us separately enghettoed. It is  
also the reason that I caution  
against emulating those we cri-  
ticize and are oppressed by.  
Audre Lorde says it more  
succinctly: “The Master’s tools  
will never dismantle the Master’s  
house.”  

And what about other  
forms of compromise? Coopera-  

themselves, as businesses acquire  
all the trappings of capitalist  
society: hierarchy, a focus on  
“efficiency,” continual growth,  
power struggles, and a status quo  
forming for “continuity’s sake.”  
Working within electoral politics  
always involves co-optation and  
compromise past the point  
where integrity can be main-  
tained. Women working to get  
ahead in the corporate world are  
learning “to make better men of  
themselves”: and in turn oppress  
others. Women who “dress for  
success” prostitute themselves  
just as surely as any Madame of  
the Red Light District. Women  
working as cops, in the military,

cation work. There will also be  
money set aside to support TR’s  
in trouble with the IRS.  

Another type of fund is  
New England Tax Resistance’s  
fund where withheld war taxes  
go into an escrow account, and  
only the interest goes for life-  
supporting work.  

Paij: So, how does “Jane Q.  
Citizen” become a tax resister?  

Lori: Tax Resistance is a  
very personal thing. There are  
any number of ways to begin;  
different people have different  
approaches to TR. It may  
mean altering one’s lifestyle. For  
instance, you might become an  
independent contractor or  
become self-employed (a secre-  
tarial “service” for instance)...  
then you are responsible for  
your own withholding process.  

As an employee, you have  
to fill out that W-2 Form. One  
way not to pay is to declare  
enough dependents so that you  
don’t have anything withheld.  
Look at the 1040 Form and see  
how many dependents will bring  
you down to a non-taxable  
income. When you file your W-4,  
claim enough dependents so that  
you don’t have any taxes with-  
held. Your employer is not  
allowed to report anything to  
the IRS, unless you claim  
nine or more dependents. This  
W-2 Form is strictly between  
you and the IRS. It is important  
when you claim extra depen-  
dents that you are “up front”  
about it: write to the IRS and  
state clearly that your depen-  
dents are Vietnam veterans who  
are Agent Orange victims, bat-

or for the State are supporting  
the very types of violent, hierar-  
chical forms that have kept them  
“in their places.” To get out of  
that “place” doesn’t mean one  
should work to replace men  
in a men’s world. This type of  
mindless mimicry will never  
change the fundamentally patho-  
logical social relationships that  
afflict us all today. Destroy the  
“men's world”... It takes more  
courage, clarity, cooperation and  
imagination to create a whole  
new context in which to relate  
and live.
