COMMONWOMAN MA

By Mary Mitchell Miller

(Excerpted from a speech
given for Catholics for a Free
Choice to the Rally for the
Protection of the Right to
Choose, held in Montpelier in
January, 1979.)

As a Catholic it hurts me to
talk about the extremely serious
debt my church owes to the
women of this world and especi-
ally to the women of the United
States, where the wealthiest and
most coercive group of bishops
on earth hold control of the
National Council of Catholic
Bishops, who in turn control the
official U.S. Catholic Church,
and, I believe, control through
gifts, pressure and prestige a
good part of the official Catholic
Church in Rome.

There are Catholics who will
be shocked at these words, deny
and contradict them and point
to the enormous benefits that
humanity owes the church. But I
say, and I believe I am a member
of the majority of Catholics,
that any church, any church at
all, that insists upon dominance
by a tiny male minority over all
the women of its church and, in
matters of social equality, over

all the women of the United
States of America, owes a debt
of such magnitude to humanity
that it can never be repaid. We
all recognize that mistakes of a
beloved family member, or a
church to which we have been
born, are fated forever to leave
marks upon our hearts and souls.

But, are we to defend such
loved ones when they fail to
practice the love of Christ they
have been preaching?

No, we are rather called to
defend the oppressed and to love
both the oppressed and the
oppressor.

Whoever said the practice of
love was easy?

Now, who are the followers
of these men who hold the
majority votes in the National
Council of Catholic Bishops,
which directs all the Catholic
churches in the United States?
These are the men who originate
and direct The Right to Life,
raise money for its promulga-
tion, support and instigate court
cases against free civil rights of
poor women to federal health
funding. What are the reasons
for the frenetic and ferocious
attacks upon women of the
United States by these bishops
and their followers?

REFLECTIONS. .

By Elizabeth White
Age 11

When I want to be alone I
go walking in the Zayre’s
shopping mall. It’s a great place
to go on weekends. There is

usually very few people there

and I can think. Mostly I think
of anything. I pretend. I think
about my dreams. In my mind I
can go back in time and for-
ward in time. I can do anything.
I can go from a witch to an
Indian. I love witches and I love
Indians. Minds are like an
all-night entertainment. They’re
open all the time.
I got little parts of my body
that talk to each other. One part
wants me to be sensible and
good, another part likes to get
into trouble and another part
tells them to shut up! I have
another part that’s experimental.
That part is willing to try almost
anything. It’s sort of connected
with the part that gets into
trouble. It’s sort of like me,
Amy and Jenny (my sisters). We
fight a lot. When you mix them
all together, you come out with
me, Elizabeth White. Sometimes
I'm one of them, sometimes I'm
all of them, sometimes I’m none
of them. Sometimes I pretend
I’m a different person from a
different world or a different
country or a different place.
The other day I was sitting
in the bathroom, then I walked

into the kitchen and got some
butter and put it on my face. I
pretended I was from a different
country where it was beautiful
to have tiny feet, tiny hands,
white faces and red lips. Except
all women weren't like that.
Some didn’t worry about how
they looked. They just went in
the fields, picked up some wood
and started to plant the corn.
They wore white sheets and
sandals.

There are about four differ-
ent groups of women. One group
likes to please people. They
make good wives and mothers.
They are really nice people.
Then there are the ones with
white faces and red lips who
spend all their time getting ready
to cook supper. They are usually
the richer ones. Then there are
the ones who have married
outsiders. They don’t have much
say in what happens in the tribe.
They are the kind that plant the
field and take care of the child-
ren. Then there are the widows
and unmarried mothers, the
women who didn’t want to
marry. They also plant the fields
and take care of children by
themselves. They have to take
care of themselves, but they
have some say in what happens
in the tribe. These women are
treated like men because they

have to take care of themselves.

To tell you the truth, I have
populated the world with so

These are questions that
have troubled many Catholics
and Christians of all faiths.
Everywhere one goes and to
whomever one listens in Catholic
circles there is dismay and shock
and, yes, anger, whenever a new
statement regarding sex, contra-
ception, abortion, divorce,
remarriage of the divorced, wo-
men in the ministry, the Equal
Rights Amendment, and wo-
men’s secondary place in society
emanates from the Roman Vati-
can or Washington’s National
Council of Catholic Bishops.

The statement from Pope
Paul VI on “Human Life,”
which in two words essentially
denied sex, caused shock waves
around the world and left the
church doors open for the
people of God to flow out the
front door; out the back door
went the priests, while the nuns
stayed home from school. Thus
was formed the great Catholic
diaspora which increases daily
with members from all classes of
society. The women’s movement
has felt their muscle more and
more as dissenters join its ranks.

The “old boy” network
starts in the offices of the
NCCB, where some laws are

actually written and delivered to

many countries that need
another galaxy to put them in!

Children’s Lib
By Heather Lea

Why can’t children who
don't know each other connect
with each other like friends?
They sorta shyly inch away and
stay far apart from each other.

I would like to have all the
children of the world to be my
friend and I wish I could know
all of their problems in life,
because I think children are a
special race in themselves and I
wish I would never become an
adult.

I also wish all children’s
oppressors (adults) would stop
to think a minute to back when
they were little people and how
people treated them and then
stop oppressing us. Why do you
think all these juvenile delin-
quents are roaming around and
hookers and runaways? Because
of the oppressing culture.

Luckily, I have it pretty
easy, but I have some friends
whose parents get away with things
with them and they just take it
like they deserve it. I know some
people who smoke because their
parents didn't let them just to
get back at them: They ruined
their bodies.

a Representative Board or a
willing Representative Hyde or
some other lawmaker from a
large urban area where that
former “sure” Catholic vote
depended upon obedience to a
Chicago or New York Bishop's
Diocesan order. (Since 1978 we
know that no Catholic vote is a
“sure” thing.)

I would like to end this
dissertation with a question
which constantly keeps coming
into my mind... in church...
alone in thought... anytime...
any day... any place:

“Why did the U.S. bishops
choose the poorest and the most
oppressed amongst our women
as the vehicle for their battle
against women’s equality in the
United States?” Perhaps I should
ask, “How could they?”

Addendum:
During Pope John Paul II's
recent visit to Mexico he sent a

clear message to his bishops:
“Evangelize! Eschew secular
politics!”

If his exhortation is heeded,
persuasion will take the place of
authoritarian militancy, even
with Catholics. Our legislatures
and Congressional, judicial and
executive departments of
government will be relieved from

I hope a lot of adults who
read this decide to think more
about how you treat your
children friends, and all the
children who read this decide to
rebel against anything that
isn’t fair to you.

Memory
By Allison Hawkins, Age 15

Shaker Mountain School

I like it when it rains in
Florida. During the day it gets
really hot and you can’t walk on
the pavement without shoes.
Sometimes your shoes get really
hot.

When the rains come in it’s
like a curtain which you can see
coming at you and sometimes it
comes very hard. The hot
pavement is warm now and the
rain is warm, so I take my shoes
off and put on shorts and I run
out in the steaming rain.

My Mexican friends are
outside running around. They
are all related. When it gets
colder we all run in their house
and dry ourselves off with thick
towels.

Mrs. Lopez is cooking a hot
dinner, so we sit down in front
of the television and wait. I get
up and tell them I am going to
see if I can stay for dinner. I run
across the lawn to our small
duplex. Jack has some friends
over, so he won't really miss me.

the pressures of at least one
religion’s outrageous inter-
ference in lawmaking.

The happy result of this
withdrawal at this particular
time could well circumvent the
growing division of our country
into two bitter political camps:
CHURCH vs. STATE. But whe-
ther or not the ordained leaders
of the Catholic church will heed
or circumvent Pope John Paul's
wishes will be watched with
interest by Christians everywhere.

Roller Skates

They gave me roller skates
At age two,
So I would learn how to cope
With unusual situations
Like having wheels on my feet.
And I would learn how to fall.
Daddy said:
“Learn how to fall, and
You will be all right."
And I distinctly remember
That it was not:
“Don’t fall...”
Just learn how to.
And every time I see those skates
Hanging in the basement
Of my father's home
My knees sting
And I spit on them
For old time’s sake.
