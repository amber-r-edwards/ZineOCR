of our bodies. (Remember last

year when the Burlington Police

wanted to curfew women

because of the high incidence of

rape.)

Many women participated
in the Tafts Corner action who
were not part of the actual
trashing. This included for many
women an examination of their
own fears around the taking of
illegal action and a consideration
of the appropriateness of the
planned action. Many women
may not agree with this specific
action because of the property
destruction involved, and
because of the civil liberties issue
(freedom of the press — censor-
ship); and also out of a lack of
awareness about the extent and
true nature of pornography.
Let's remember that the destruc-
tion that happened was the
destruction of trash — magazines
and books depicting the humilia-
tion and physical violation of
our (women’s) bodies. Porno-
graphy, like rape, must be
reviewed and properly under-
stood as violence linked with
sexuality and acted out upon
women. There is no other
cultural or ethnic group in our
“libertarian” society that must
constantly suffer the display and
sale of their images so violently
degraded. Our exploited bodies
are available and legal on record
jackets, at movies, drive-ins,
bookstores and beer outlets,
because our social and judicial
system will make no distinction
between eroticism and violent
sexuality.

“I'm always being blamed
for something I didn’t do. Now
I've done something and I’m
being told I did nothing.”

—One Furious Woman

Seventeen women commit-
ted a willful act of vandalism in
an attempt to make a political
stand on pornography, in an
attempt to fight back, in an
attempt to be heard. Two days
later the Burlington Free Press
printed an uninvestigated, faulty
story; with this mocking head-
line, CALLER CLAIMS

CREDIT FOR NOTHING. The
gist of the Free Press story was
that nothing happened at the
bookstore because, as the
Police reported, there was “no
evidence of forced entry.” It's
not surprising that they would
use such standard male legal rape
criteria to determine whether
anything happened. The fact is,
that as was fully reported in the
Vanguard Press two weeks later,
something did happen, and part
of that happening was an
attempted coverup, a silencing,
by the store manager, the police,
and the press.

One of the most effective
means of oppression is the
obliteration of cultural heritage,
of roots, so that a people feel
unconnected — without a know-
ledge of their ancestry, its magic
and power, (Women give up
their names to their husbands.)
As we become active in the
making of radical change we
experience this oppression on a
very immediate level; our actions
which are herstory (or history)
making are ignored, silenced,
underplayed, deliberately denied
media coverage. The Tafts
Corner coverage is not the first
time large women’s actions have
been grossly underreported by
the press. On April 29 of this
year several hundred women and
children marched on the streets
of Burlington to “take back the
night.” This was a major action.
Political marches of that size
occur rarely if ever in this city.
Free Press coverage amounted to
a photo on a rear page and a one
line description. Human interest
and recipes usually rate more
than that in the Free Press, and
this march was not only of
human interest, it was a critical
statement about the lives and
bodies of women, children and
elderly on the night streets of
this city.

WE MUST BEGIN TO ACT
OUT, SPEAK OUT, STRIKE
OUT.

WE MUST MAKE OUR-
SELVES VISIBLE AND
HEARD THOUGH THEY
ATTEMPT TO SILENCE US.

NOTHING IS HAPPENING
IN THE SEVENTIES (except
the women’s movement).
