I started smoking marijuana
relatively late in life — at 32.
When I went to college from ‘61
to ‘65 Ray Charles was scream-
ing at us not to end the war, but
to notice the lady with the red
dress on. The closest we ever
came to mass demonstrations
was when a sizeable group of
jerks from the boys’ dorms
marched across campus to
demand that girls throw their
panties out their second story
windows. To escape that sort of
foolishness I got married. For
the next ten years I remained
too naive, isolated and con-
trolled trying to adjust to my
role as wife, then Air Force wife,
then Air Force wife and mother
to ever muck about with altering
my consciousness. When I finally
moved to Vermont so that I
could stay still long enough to
get in touch with my oppression,
I discovered dope. I knew I
never wanted to drink. I had
only gotten drunk three times in
my life and the experiences were
only mildly amusing after I
recovered from the nausea.
Alcohol was obviously too debi-
litating.

IHATE CHRIS

By Donna Gordon

If you love me, prove it this
Christmas with the biggest, most
modern, computerized, bright-
est, loudest,
up-to-date, most expensive what-
ever around.

Christmas: a holiday geared
towards making poor people,
non-Christians, non-white and
energy conscious people feel bad
and angry. As a poor, Jewish
lesbian who is conscious of
energy waste, Christmas drives
me crazy.

As a Jew I have difficulty
with the strong connection
between the government and a
clearly Christian holiday. I saw a
brightly lit cross on the fire
department building and Christ-
mas decorations all along Church
St. and North St. I saw men
from the electric department
getting paid to hang Christmas
decorations. I thought about

POT SMOKING:
Highs and Lows

But pot was different — no
vomiting, no hangover, no sense
of helplessness. As a matter of
fact I found myself reacting to
the drug in ways that felt
extremely self-affirming. Whereas
I used to berate myself for
being a compulsive talker I
found that I could give myself
full permission to remain silent,
fascinated with the new environ-
ment I created for my old
thoughts. I even discovered that
sitting still for hours thinking
was considered a lost art, accord-
ing to Gaston Bachelard, who
wrote The Poetics of Reverie.
Whereas I always saw myself as
restless and unfocused, I found
that I could now sit still self-
preserved no matter where I was
(in a cat, in the woods, at my
desk writing, with my children,
at a meeting). Instead of falling
asleep on the couch in the
evenings, I could listen to
WRUV for three hours just
enjoying the free associations
that each song triggered. My half
hour baths could last for an hour
and a half. I could smoke a joint
and dance like I never danced
before. Yoga was no longer a
discipline that I had to cram into

how much more valuable work
these men could have been paid
to get done (like fixing the
wiring on some of the fire traps
in the North End). I was being
consistently bombarded with

the cracks between my job and
family responsibilities, but with
a few tokes I could take myself
on long stretchy trips that lasted
all evening. I became aware of
every muscle in my neck, knew
just how air traveled up and out
from my lungs, felt certain I
now understood from the inside
out the whole Eastern con-
sciousness of still point, of slow-
ing down, of deep relaxation.
And the visions! For so many of
those contented hours congratula-
ting myself for sitting still for a
change, I projected myself into
the future — living alone as a
writer in my log cabin in the
woods, revelling in potentially
new relationships, changing my

style of dress, and fomenting
revolution. Pain no longer
seemed a part of being alone.

As well as discovering that I
could sit still with myself, I also
introduced myself to the world
of hanging out — a new way for
me to be with friends. Hanging
out meant I gave myself per-
mission not to be goal-oriented.
I could just set aside some time
to be with people, light up, and
then see what spontaneously

emerged from our interactions.
Previously whenever I got toge-
ther with others there would
always be a dinner planned, a
movie picked out, a project to
work on. Pot seemed to give me
the courage to face a period of

unstructured time and to trust
the process of initiating action
by following my feelings at the
moment. Since pot was helping
me stay so internally aware, I
became less haunted by linear
time, more inclined to follow
the signals my body sent me. I
learned to develop an apprecia-
tion of liberating myself from
schedules as well as switching
directions rather than sticking to
what I was doing just because I
had been conditioned to value a
finished product. I virtually
eliminated the problem of giving
power over to other people
because whenever I smoked

Christmas decorations, Christmas
carols, and Christmas advertising.
I got the message loud and clear
that this is not my city: My
oppression is blatant and infur-
iating. I get to understand that

the separation of Church and
State is not so clearly separate.
I'm frightened and angered by
all of it.

As a womyn who is poor, I
am aware that if I did “celebrate”
Christmas my lack of money would
frustrate me to tears. Money for a tree, decora-
tions, gift wrapping, cards and
presents costs a fortune. Of
course, shoplifting is at high
tide at this time of year. A
person can only reach a certain
level of frustration before some-
thing is going to break — be it
them or the law. People are
being advertised at to death.
How are your kids going to feel
when the only present you can
afford is the long underwear
they needed anyway?

As for energy waste aware-
ness... I was in Hartford, Conn.,
for the Thanksgiving weekend.
My friend there wanted to go see

the Festival of Lights. So off we
went to downtown Hartford.
There were hundreds of people.
There was a stage set up and a
sound system and a choir
leading us all in Christmas carols.
Then Santa shows up — in a
helicopter! He gets dropped off
at the top of a skyscraper. At
the top of this skyscraper is a
fake sleigh and reindeer attached
to the side of the building, and
down comes Santa in his sleigh,
waving to all the people. I was
horrified. I kept thinking about
the gas for the helicopter and
the electricity for the sleigh, the
lights and the sound system.
I also thought about the poor
and/or the older people who
freeze to death in the winter
because they can’t afford to pay
the enormous fuel bills. Again, I
was pissed off. If this was a
