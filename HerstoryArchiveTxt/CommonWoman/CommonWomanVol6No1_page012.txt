Have you seen the movie
Ragtime? It's a highly recom-
mended film based on the book
by E. L. Doctorow. Rumor has
it that the movie is nowhere near
as ecstatic as the book, but this
is usually the case when books
are converted into films. None-
theless, Michael Weller’s (screen-
writer) attempt to project the
book onto the screen has not
been in vain. The movie presents
a very subtle look at the moral-
ity of our great nation during
the early 1900s. The plot
revolves around race and power,
a topic tackled many times by
filmmakers. Unlike other films
of its kind, Ragtime does not
make any blatant, erroneous,
political and/or moral state-

ments. Instead it merely tells its
story and leaves the judgment-
making to the viewer.

Through the lives and
actions of the characters we see
the dichotomy which exists, the
double standard which exists
among the haves and have
nots. Two significant murders
occur in the film. The first is
committed by Harry Thaw,
played by Robert Joy, who
shoots a man point-blank in the
head for displaying a nude statue
of Thaw’s wife, a former chorus
girl. Harry is white. The other
murder is committed by Coal-
house Walker, Jr., played by
Howard E. Rollins. Coalhouse is
a black man whose dignity and
pride is disgraced by a group of

white volunteer firemen. When
Coalhouse seeks retribution
from authorities, his justice is
denied and his fiancée Sara,
played by Debbie Allen, is killed
seeking justice for him. Conse-
quently, he takes the law into
his own hands at the expense of
the firemen.

The outcome? Any person
reading these facts could assume
since murder is murder, since life
is life, since justice is justice,
that both of these men got equal
treatment under the law. But has
there ever been such a thing as
equality under the law between
Blacks and Whites? The outcome
in Ragtime is no different! Harry
is tried and declared insane. He’s

Handywoman Hints

This was first intended to be
a question and answer column,
but lacking any questions to
answer, this will be a how to,
useful project, a wall hanging
unit for a kitchen or any room.

Here is a list of tools you'll
need to beg, steal, borrow or
buy: electric drill; no. 8 screw-
mate or countersink; hand saw;
square edge; tape measure;
screwdriver.

You can buy the materials
you'll need at any local lumber
yard; I would suggest Wood-
bury’s on King St., because they
have a pretty helpful attitude.
Here’s a list: one 1x8x8; one
1x3x12; a small bottle of
Elmer's Wood Glue; 28 No. 8 x
1½" screws; one piece no. 120
sandpaper; a small can of plastic
wood (optional). The total price
of materials should come to
about $12 or $13.

Lumber like you'll be using,
called no. 2 or common pine, is
planed from a rough cut board
that starts out a full one inch
thick and in this case a full eight
inches wide. In the process of
planing, it loses ¼ inch in the
thickness and about ¼ inch
width. So when you ask for a
1x8x8, what you're really get-
ting is a smooth board ¾ inch
thick, 7¼ inches wide and 8 feet
long. The 1x3x12 is really ¾ by
2¼, etc. Ask to have the 1x3 cut
to two lengths about 9 and 3
feet long unless you can fit the
whole twelve feet in or on your
car.

For the shelves, the 1x8 will
have to be cut into three lengths
exactly 30 inches long each. You
can ask to have it cut on a power
saw at the lumber yard, which
will ensure a good square cut, or
if you want more to do yourself
you can cut it at home by hand
or with a hand power saw (skill
saw). If you plan to cut it
yourself, be sure both cuts,
across the width and down the
edge, are quite square. (See Fig.
A). If you don’t have a square
edge to make a mark for the cut,
try using a record album, hold-
ing it across the board both ways
to make the lines. The side
pieces that hold the shelves
together (Fig. B,1), should be
cut 24½ inches long. Cut all four
of them from the 9-foot piece of
1x3. The end cuts on these
pieces are less critical because
they don’t join with anything
else.

O.K., now you have three

30” shelves and four 24½” sides
and you're ready to lay out for
assembly. Mark both sides of
each of the four side supports as
shown in Fig. C. The lines for
the shelves (¾” wide) are set in
from each end 1 inch with one
more in the middle. The open
space between each shelf should
be a full 10 inches. On one side
of each piece make two dots
that mark where you will drill
the screw holes, 5/8 inch from
each outside edge. Do this for
each shelf, (see Fig. D). Now
you're ready to invite a friend,
because you'll need an extra pair
of hands to hold (the wood,
not yours) while you drill and
screw the shelves together.

Set the shelves on the floor
on edge with 10 inches between
them. Butt them up against a
wall to keep them from sliding
back. To get a perspective on
how this should all look, see
Figure F. Place a thin bead of
glue in the spaces where the
shelves go, on the inside of the
side piece (one piece at a time,
the glue dries fast). One of you
can hold the side support up
against the shelf ends, flush with
the edge of the shelf; hold tight,
while one of you drills holes for
the screws, where you have
marked on the outside of the
shelf supports. [A note about
drilling. You'll have to do the
best you can by eye to drill a
straight hole. The countersink
bit that you will use will drill the
hole and leave a wide hole at the
very end for the screw to set
into. This makes a hole for the
screw to be hidden in and
covered with the plastic wood.
Set the length of the bit, from
the stop that hits the wood, to
the tip of the bit at the same
length as the screw.]

Back to the assembly. Glue,
drill and screw both pieces, top
and bottom, then flip it all over
and do the same thing on the
other end. Whew! What a sea of
words.

Now, how to mount them
on the wall. You still have a

piece of 1x3, right? Cut it to 30
inches, so it will fit inside the
two back side supports and
under the top shelf. This is
called a cleat. See Fig. E. Attach
it to the shelf by drilling down
into it through the top shelf.
The holes will be sunk into the
top shelf, and can be filled with
wood putty like the ones on the
side. Screw it in at four points,
about 2 inches from each end
and two evenly spaced in the
middle. Sand the putty after it
dries hard, and lightly sand the
edges of all the wood to soften it
a bit. Now comes the hardest
part, finding the studs in the
wall, ugh. One hint is, there is
usually a stud just to one side of
an electrical outlet, or 15½
inches in from a corner. If you
can't find one this way, try the
hammer trick; you'll need a
good ear. Tap the wall lightly
with a hammer or your knuckle
and listen for the sound to
change from hollow to solid. If
you hear a solid spot, try ham-
mering in a small nail to see if
you've found it. Once you find a
stud, the others should be 16
inches apart from center to
center, or maybe 24 inches apart
in an old house. You’ll have to
hold the shelf up to the height
you want it and set it so it
covers two studs somewhere on
the wall. I hope your friend is
still there, so one of you can
hold it and one of you can nail
through the cleat, on through
the plaster or sheetrock and
solid into the studs. Good luck.
Use one 3-inch nail at each stud,
and give it a test for strength
before you put too much weight
on it.

Another note on drilling: if
you don’t want to bother with
countersinking and filling the
holes, just use a drill bit slightly
smaller than the screws to
pre-drill, and set the screws
flush. If you do want to counter-
sink, and haven't used one
before, ask whoever you borrow
or buy it from to show you how
to set it up.

Write to Commonwoman,
P.O. Box 242, Winooski, Vt. for
questions you'd like answered in
future issues.

released when they feel he is
sane again. Of course his family
had money. Coalhouse Walker
Jr., on the other hand, is never
tried in court. He is shot by
order of the Police Commis-
sioner, played by James Cagney,
with no provocation whatsoever
other than the fact that this
man, this black man, had the
nerve to scorn and challenge
white America.

Ragtime is well done, well
acted, subsequently its message
is well received. It exposes us to
the strength of money and the
vastness of racial inequality. It
additionally shows us the
changes and lessons one middle-
class white family encounters
when they take interest in
matters outside of their New
Rochelle home. They act on
their liberalism by showing con-
cern for Sara and her baby
fathered by Coalhouse, and later
for Coalhouse himself. We also
see an example of beauty and
youth being manipulated for
greed; fortunately the beauty in
this case, Evelyn Nesbit Shaw,
played by Elizabeth McGovern,
reaps some of the profits too. At
least she’s naive enough to think
so. Ragtime saddens the heart
and entertains the mind at the
same time. It’s the kind of movie
that can be seen several times—
and still be found enjoyable... if
one doesn’t think too hard
about the message. Go see it!
