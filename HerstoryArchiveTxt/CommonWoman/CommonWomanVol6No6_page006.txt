What is PMS?  

Premenstrual syndrome  
(PMS) is a range of physical signs  
and/or emotional changes that  
occur before each period. Some  
of the signs of PMS include  
tension, depression, crying for  
no apparent reason, fatigue,  
weight gain, pelvic discomfort,  
water retention causing bloating  
and breast tenderness, headaches  
and backaches. These signs are  
relieved at the onset of the  
menstrual period, followed by a  
phase of physical and emotional  
well-being.  

Who Has PMS?  
PMS affects millions of  
women. It has been estimated  

that between 40-70 percent of  
all women cope with PMS at  
some time in their lives. For  
about 10 percent of these  

women, PMS is serious enough  
to dramatically disrupt their  
careers and personal lives. Many  
women begin noticing PMS after  
a major hormonal change, for  
example, after childbirth or  
birth control pill use. Some  
researchers theorize that PMS is  
hereditary.  

Do I Have PMS?  

There is no medical test to  
diagnose PMS; however, keeping  
a monthly journal of emotional  
and bodily changes each cycle  
will help identify PMS. The  
timing of the changes/signs is  
crucial to the identification of  
PMS, as well as the resolution  
and absence of these signs after  
each period.  

The exact cause of PMS is  

not known. Some researchers  

believe that PMS is the result of  
a hormone pro-  

progesterone  

duced by the ovaries deficiency.  
Others believe that hormonal  
changes before menses deplete  
vitamins and affect mineral  
balance, which in turn brings  
about the signs of PMS.  
Traditional View of PMS  
Historically, women with  
PMS have been viewed as hyster-  
ical or crazy. Those affected by  
PMS have been institutionalized  
as psychotic or had unnecessary  
hysterectomies and other medi-  
cal treatments to “cure” PMS.  

Ignorance of the condition  
meant that limited PMS research  
was done; consequently, ineffect-  

ive therapies or regimes were  
offered.  

Recently, however, the  
medical establishment has recog-  
nized PMS as a legitimate  
women’s health concern. Unfor-  
tunately, as PMS becomes popu-  
larized in the media, women are  
again becoming victimized by  
the attitude that women are at  
the mercy of “raging hormones”  
and are therefore incapable,  
unreliable, and high-strung. We  
hope that women-controlled  
research on PMS will help  
empower us, as well as enable us  
to educate the medical estab-  
lishment and the public about  
our medical and political con-  
cerns.  

Coping with PMS  

Diet. It is recommended  
that caffeine, alcohol, and sugar  
consumption be decreased, and  
that small meals be eaten  
frequently during the day. This  
helps prevent shakiness, head-  
aches, and irritability which can  

result from low blood sugar.  
Limiting salt intake from ovula-  
tion until menses can minimize  
fluid retention. Foods such as  
parsley, eggplant, asparagus,  
cucumber, and strawberries help  
the body pass excess fluid.  
Herbal teas such as skullcap,  
comfrey, and valerian may have a  
relaxing effect for the time when  

tension is a problem.  
Supplements. Many women  

get relief from depression and  
irritability by taking vitamin  
supplements. Pyridoxine (Vita-  
min B6) can be taken in  
amounts of up to 200 mg/day.  
Vitamin B6 that is not used will  
be excreted by the body. In  
general, the positive effects of  
B6 will not be felt until a couple  
of months after starting the  
regimen. It is advisable to take  
Vitamin B6 as part of the B  
complex, and not separately. B  
complex should be purchased at  
a health food store where the  
inventory is fresher, and where  
vitamins without starch and  
sugar coating are available.  

Calcium blood levels drop  
about 10 days before a period  
occurs. Calcium, which contri-  
butes to normal heart function  
and muscle tone, may be taken  
in doses up to 1000 mg/day, and  
should be taken with an equal  
dose of magnesium.  

Exercise. Exercise is related  
to general well-being. Premen-  
strual tension and aches from  
fluid retention can be eased  
through exercise and massage. In  
general, slow stretching is most  
beneficial. A list of exercises  

specifically for PMS can be  

found in How to Relieve  
Cramps. (see below).  
Progesterone Therapy. For  
some women, progesterone sup-  
positories or injections have  
brought relief from PMS, in  
conjunction with diet changes.  
The closest PMS clinic offering  
progesterone treatment is  
located in the Lynnfield Office  
Park, Lynnfield, MA 01940,  
617-245-9585. It should be  
noted that the effectiveness of  
progesterone has not been  
proven through large-scale con-  
trolled research. There is some  
evidence that the effect of  
progesterone in some women is  
no more beneficial than place-  

bos. Long-term effects of  
progesterone therapy are  
unknown.

Women in Chairs  

graphic by Connie Panzarino  

1) Do not automatically  
hold onto a person’s wheelchair.  
It is part of the person’s body  
space. Hanging or leaning on the  
chair is similar to hanging  
or leaning on a person sitting in  
a chair. It is often fine if you are  
friends, but inappropriate if you  
are strangers.  

2) Offer assistance if you  
wish, but do not insist. If a  
person needs help, s/he will  
accept your offer and tell you  
exactly what will be helpful. If  
you force assistance it can  
sometimes be unsafe as when  
you grab the chair and the  
person using it loses her/his  
balance.  

3) Talk directly to the  
person using the wheelchair, not  
to a third party. The person is  
not helpless or unable to talk.  

4) Don’t be sensitive about  
using words like “walking” or  
“running.” People using wheel-  
chairs use the same words.  

5) Be alert to the existence  
of architectural barriers when  
selecting a restaurant, home,  
theater, or other facility you  
want to visit with a wheel-  
chair user.  

6) If conversation proceeds  
more than a few minutes and it  

is possible to do so, consider  

sitting down in order to share  
eye level. It is uncomfortable for  
a seated person to look straight  
up for a long period.
