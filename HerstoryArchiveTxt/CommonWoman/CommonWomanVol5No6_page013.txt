« SOLDIER GIRLS Y

The Gay Divorcees and Gal  
By Baba Rose  

It was a cold and soggy  
afternoon much warmed by talk  
of dreams, stuck places and  
coffee with a friend. In the  
midst of it she asked if  
I was going to see the  
Gay Divorcees and Gal  

that evening. Yes,  
Wonderful! Would I do  
a review for  
Commonwoman?  
Although no sophisticate  
about theatre, music  
and reviews, my friend  
knows me to be a ‘closeted’  
writer struggling to ‘come out’  
(as it were). I agreed to do my  
best.  

At the time I failed to  
appreciate my capacity for  
sabotaging those best intentions,  
including arriving late to the  
theatre that night and almost  
not getting this review written  
(that is another story). However,  
once I found the right entrance,  
made my way down the stairs  
and past the antiquities of the  
Fleming Museum, I was greeted  
by Gal's now familiar sounds.  

Gal's performance had al-  
ready begun as I stepped into  
the darkened auditorium and  
saw her standing in the spotlight;  
her body movements as much a  
‘signature’ as her unique music.  
Clad only in tank top, shorts, (I  
missed her red dress) bobby sox  
and red shoes, she swung her hip  
and slapped her rump in a  
high-moving, rhythmical accom-  
paniment to her a cappella  
“spunky rock.”  

Not quite certain how to go  
about ‘reviewing’ something,  
I made a few notes — now unread-  
able — and decided to relax and  
allow the evening’s performances  
to wash over me and trust that  
my impressions would be suffi-  
cient.  

This night I enjoyed Gal!  
That is not to say that I didn’t  
enjoy her performance at the  
Everywoman’s Place Benefit  
Dinner. That evening she was  
sandwiched in between other per-  
formers, her mc’ing duties,  
and an overcrowded and smoke-  
filled room. But this night, with  
time and space and our undivi-  
ded attention, she seemed to  
find her own rhythms. Songs  
were introduced and explained.  
Words were understandable. It  
was a well-paced, spunky, per-  
formance without the frenetic  
quality of her last performance.  

As enjoyable as her music  
was, the banter between songs  
was equally so. It was the kind  
of banter that brings tears to  
your eyes and piddle to your  
pants when you laugh. Through-  
out, Gal drew us into her  
unique world of songs and  

rhythms, stories and laughter.  

Intermission.  

Sophie and Tita, recently of  
Three Clowns fame, were with  
us again from Boston. This time,  
as the Gay Divorcees presenting  

“A Show of Bad Taste,” we  
were to share in their theatre of  
commentary on the “effects of  
violence on our psyche.”

The UVM media service has  
in its possession for local use the  
film Soldier Girls. It's a feature-  
length documentary on women  
in the army. It is an excellent  
film and anyone interested in  
this issue ought to take a look at  
it. The film follows a platoon of  
female PFCs from basic training  
to graduation. We see the  
women training, their barracks  
life, and some of the trials that  
come up. It gives a real and  
disturbing picture of how  
women are made into soldiers.  

The training is violent and  
dehumanizing, not surprisingly  
since that is the purpose of  
the army. It is disheartening to  
see women going around yelling  
kill, kill, though for those who  
want equality with men, I  
suppose that’s where it’s at.  
What I experienced, how-  
ever, was a series of vignettes,  
well crafted and enjoyable, but  
which did not seem to hang  
together very well along this  
central theme. For example, we  
were first greeted by two very  
straight and proper ladies  
obviously uncomfortable with the  
makeup of the audience and what  
was to transpire that evening. It was a  
funny piece, but we never see  
them again and I’m not at all  
clear how this piece relates to  
the theme of violence to our  
psyche... etc.  

Once again, there were  
many fine scenes depicting the  
character’s nightmares of sui-  
cide, alcoholism, violence and  
death, as well as the intimacy,  
comfort and peculiarities shared  
between women during their  
waking hours. But then one of  
the characters climbs out of bed  
to rummage through some  
boxes, leaving them strewn  
across the floor. Later she  
returns to stack them like  
building blocks. Upon succeed-  

ing, she knocks them down. It was a wonderful  
mime, but I was left wondering  
once again what this piece had  
to do with the overall theme.  

Perhaps it was just me who  
didn’t understand, I thought as  
I left the Fleming auditorium that  
evening. Talking with friends in  
the next several days, I learned  
that I had not been the only one  
confused and not quite certain  
what we had seen presented by  
the Gay Divorcees.  

I wish now that I had had a  
programme, some written sharing  
of thoughts from Tita and  
Sophie to help me understand.  
Perhaps had Tita and Sophie  
lingered after the performance  
to talk with the audience — a  
dialogue — it might have helped.  
I will save my questions for the  
next time they are in town, and  
will look forward with anticipa-  
tion to the new creations they'll  
share with us.  

Writing my ‘review’ wasn’t  
as bad as I thought it was going  
to be, except for the problems  
I've created for others by my  
procrastination over doing it.  
I'm still working on a reasonable  
imitation of Gal’s spunky-hip-  
swing. It’s bound to become the  
latest rage on the dance floor  
here in town.  

These women are there though  
mostly because they see no  
other openings for education  
because they are poor and the  
army presents itself as an Oppor-  
tunity. Some of the women  
quickly learn it is not what they  
want and we realize many did  
not get a real picture from the  
recruiter who is trying to meet  
his quota.  

At one point a sergeant  
demonstrates how to kill a  
chicken by biting its head off.  
The women are clearly disgusted  
and to make it worse he throws  
the still moving chicken body  
into their midst. We also see an  
absurd training session in how to  
survive a nuclear attack. You  
just brush the stuff off you and  
try to take a shower is what the  
officer tells them. The lack of  
showers in such conditions and

A review/interview of  

Evolution of Wombmoon  

For the past few weeks,  
Everywoman’s Place has housed,  
in one of its rooms, an environ-  
ment created by Indigo Snake,  
called the Evolution of Womb-  
moon. The title comes from a  
sorority pageant, Evolution of  
Woman, at which Indigo, for-  
merly Linda, was picked queen.  
The title has been transformed  
by Indigo to mean her own  
lesbian coming-out process. In  
addition to the art show Indigo  
also held a reading of her poetry.  
In both the visual art and her  

writing the themes are her  
process from male-defined  
wife/mother/nurturer to self-  
definition and woman-identified  
woman, her celebration of newfound  
freedom with women and  
her belief that the future is  
indeed female. The room con-  
sisted of images of her life from  
childhood to the present, the  
past fittingly represented mainly  
by photographs taken by an  
observer, the future her own  
drawings, words, pictures from  

the real lethalness of radioacti-  
vity are hidden from them. I am  
reminded of the men who  
watched the first atomic bombs,  
told by the army it was safe,  
who have died or are dying  
of cancer now.  

We see too, how the army  
system of harassment works to  
indoctrinate people. One woman  
who is shown in a supportive  
role to her barracks mates early  
in the movie, later becomes a  
squad leader and takes a disci-  
plinary role with them later in  
the training. This is the only  
reward for the hardships one  
suffers in the army. One can  
become the discipliner instead of  
the disciplined. But the whole  
thing is a sado-masochistic hier-  
archy, typical of patriarchy, so  
the film makes one wonder what  
are women doing here.  

Two women in the platoon  
resist fiercely, each in her own  
way. Johnson, a black woman  
from Mississippi, just won't learn  
to be a fighting machine or to  
suppress all her feelings. She is  
simply who she is and in this  
context that is really a heroic  
act. No matter how much  

within. How to review all this?  
Indigo suggested an interview so  
that’s what follows.  

P.L.: Why did you call this  
your coming out show?  

I.S.: Coming out has to do  
with validation of yourself. I  
wanted to put my images in an  
understandable and appreciable  
form. The whole process allowed  
me to get clearer on many  
things. It was also a coming out  
into the culture for me, from  
living in the woods alone.  

P.L.: What about politics in  
this show?  

I.S.: My life is my politics.  
What I do every day is a political  
stand. I want to reverse the tapes  
the culture has put in, to turn  
those images around for myself  
and of course the next step is to  

put those images out.  
The message is for women. It is  
beyond what the culture has  
created to find real inspiration  
for living. As women we know  
something very different or as a  
woman I know something very  
different. It’s time women saved  
the planet. We need to get in  
touch with our power, what we  
really know. Men should get in  
touch with themselves too, but I  
don’t want to be responsible for  
that.  

P.L.: Some women would  
say well that’s nice we all want  
to save the planet, but how does  
creating art do that?  

I.S.: Just because men have  
defined politics as this, this, and  
this doesn’t mean we have to.  
Women have to do it in our own  
ways. It will probably be entire-  
ly subversive. I have every sense  
they don’t know what we're  
doing. Politics is being respon-  
sible, looking at what's happen-  
ing. I know about bombs and  
missiles, men’s shit, that’s a  
given. But if we don’t get in  
touch with our messages then
