To Whom It May Concern

By Mimo (Karen) Davis  
Consuelo Quinones  

Many women of this com-  
munity have asked us — Why is  
there negativity among Third  
World Women against the “Burl-  
ington lesbian community?”  
Among other questions such as  
— are we still friends? etc. etc...  

After a long period of  
discussion and thinking among  
ourselves, it came to whether or  
not to even respond to such  
ridiculous questions. We decided  
to address the issue to avoid any  
further out of reality conversa-  
tions.  

Over the years, several of us  
have tried to work along with  
our white sisters in the struggle  
of creating a place where “isms”  
need not exist.  

Instead, creations of so  
called racism groups formed,  
excluding Third World Women.  
Yes, we know this is an old  
topic, and yes, we realize Wilda  
White received apology letters,  
but this offense was not to Wilda  
alone. This was an offense to all  
Third World Women of this  
Community.  

This incident created anger  
among Third World Women and  
guilt among white women.  
Which is still festering within us  
all, and it will continue to fester,  
until people have taken positive  
action to correct past behavior.  

As the year continued, we  
saw more neglect towards our  
needs. Six women were arrested,  
four were Third World women.

A Story of Xmas  

By Consuelo Quinones  

“Twas the night before  
Christmas and all through the  
house, not a creature was  
stirring, not even a mouse; The  
stockings were hung by the  
chimney with care, In hopes  
that Saint Nicholas soon would  
be there...”  

Good old Santa, so many of  
us can still remember those tiny  
little rat-tat-tats of reindeer on  
the roof. (I don’t)  

I lived in a city, with tall  
buildings in an apt. where if  
Santa wanted to come drop  
some stuff off at my house he  
would have had to come down  
the fire escape or the front door.  

Not very ingenious,  

In my neighborhood, he  
probably would have been  
picked up for burglary or more  
like it burglarized.  

But Santa Claus, as we all  
know, is one of those myths  
children believe along with dra-  
gons, witches that fly on  
brooms, elves and fairies, and  
lesbians are all weirdos anyway.  

As the time passes and  
children grow older and wiser,  
Santa Claus disperses like a  

cloud of smoke. Finding that  
what’s left in the sky is the  
sun. GOD. A white man’s son,  

who was born to suffer and die  
on the cross for us. Pretty heavy  
trip, wouldn’t you say. Being a  
martyr. That someone would  
sacrifice oneself for another.  

Must have been a pretty  
unselfish guy...? or a case of  
mistaken identity. Actually, I  
was always under the impres-  
sion that man was a white  
Jewish leader.  

As the days go on, and  
Christmas nears, we are faced  
with the ding-a-lings, organiza-  
tions trying to raise money for  
the poor, crowds jamming in  
card shops to buy Hanukkah and  
Christmas cards. And somehow  
people become more generous in  
their ways — giving, giving,  
giving — till the pockets go dry  
and the bells you hear aren't in  
the streets anymore but cash  
registers screaming — GIVE ME!  

And at a time like this,  
where unemployment is at a  
high, inflation is depressing, and  
the only one walking away with  

(continued on page 12)  

their  

political bandwagon  
screaming about the injustices,  
wanting to support the Third  

World women, not taking into  
account that these were Third  
World women that would go  
before an all-white court system  
in the state of Vermont. (Think  
about it.) By the time it came  
for three Third World women to  
go to court, this supportive  
political bandwagon had driven  
itself to Michigan Music Festival.  
Once again Third World women  
were left without support.  

This added more anger  
among Third World women and  
more guilt among white women,  
still festering within us all.  

Then we saw some white  
women of the community, with-  
holding the right of a Third  
World woman to be mother of  
her own dark-skinned child. This  
again added more anger and  
more guilt, still festering within  
us all.  

For lack of support from  
the women’s lesbian community  
we turned to each other, creat-  
ing an ever so strong bond of  
total support and love for each  

other. For this we thank the  
Burlington lesbian/women’s  
community.  

As this bond formed, we  
noticed white women friends  
that we did have  
and changed the way they  
related to us. When discuss-  
ing with these white women —  
Why? What had changed our  
relationships with them? We  

weirded out  

received answers like — women  
being intimidated, scared, fearful  

of the Third World women’s  
bonds. But still left us asking  
why are they scared of us?  
Leaving us as violators of a  
crime, taking no responsibility  
for this bond, they are so fearful  

of. (Is there a fear of Jewish  
unity in this community? Think  
about it.)  

We feel this fear is from  

guilt. Our visible unity reminds  
white women of why it exists.  
Existing because of their own  
irresponsibility of their racism.  

We also noticed women  
were so dedicated to achieving a  
goal of being Politically Correct  
that they have blocked them-  
selves and cannot realistically  
begin to deal with the ever-  
growing reality of racism in this  
community.  

All of these things com-  
bined, added more anger to  
Third World women and more  
guilt to white women, still  
festering within us all.  

This was the final straw that  
broke “this bridge called our  
backs.” This is when we decided  
to become a political bond,  
creating ways of meeting our  
own needs, separate from the  
women’s community.  

As the pimple grew to a  
head, the money group talked  
about doing something for Third  
World women (if we were going  
to have a Hanukkah celebration,  
we would consult with Jewish  
women about how to do it.  
Think about it.) Then, to relieve  
some of this festering guilt  
$961.00 was granted to Third  
World women. (How do you  
spell relief?)  

&  
HOMEMADE,  

WITH HOT FRENCH BREAD/AT 107  

Don't think we're not  
accepting of this grant. It’s how  
it arrived we want you to  
recognize.  

So then the pimple pops.  

A sister of ours from  
another community, Michelle  
Cliff comes to share her experi-  
ence as a Third World woman, as  
she deals with having white  
privilege and choosing to deny  
it. Claiming her own identity of  
color. As we looked around the  
audience, we saw non-interest,  
boredom, women leaving, wom-  
en talking, and not sharing as she  
was so willing to do.  

After Michelle was done,  
women were stuck on petty  
issues during the discussion, that  
had nothing to do with Michelle.  

If this letter sounds bitter —  
you bet your “sweet pink cunt”  
it is — maybe because it’s time it  
should be.  

Our isolation is our way of  
fulfilling our own needs. Yet this  
is not the ultimate solution. This  
is a temporary solution, until  
our white sisters start actively  
taking part in the War Against  
Racism. (This does not mean  
having meetings or forming a  
group against racism or calling us  
up to relieve some of the guilt.)  

We mean ACTIVELY taking  
part. And we can begin by  
taking capsules of goldenseal to  
rid the  

all,  

We want a solution to this  
madness!!! TINT  

Festering sores within  

eA?
