VIEWPOINT / VIEWPOINTS

W.A.R.: A View

In the fall of 1975, Women
Against Rape, Burlington, was a
year and a half old. I had just
moved to Vermont, alone with
my child, searching out a
feminist womyn's community, a
place to put my newly forming
feminist politic to work. For
over a year I had been living in a
world of books, feminist books
that were filling empty spaces in
me. The week after moving to
Burlington, I joined WAR. I
intend this writing to be more
than a herstory of WAR. I
believe in the power of writing
to move womyn, especially if it
is personal. This writing will
review my personal political
process in WAR, too, to some
degree.

WAR Burlington was a part of
the womyn’s anti-rape
movement in the United States
of the early 70s. Feminist
womyn around the country were
educating themselves and the
public about rape — rape as a
political act — a war between the
sexes. They started rape hotlines
and pressured police, doctors,
hospitals, men and womyn to
challenge their prejudices about
rape. They initiated rape
speak-outs, training sessions,
rape support groups. By the mid
70s most every mid-large city in
the U.S. had a rape crisis hotline
or rape support group. In
England during the same period,
womyn were focusing on the
problem of womyn-beating —
domestic violence. Violence

against womyn takes many
forms. Womyn’s groups work
worldwide now to fight
clitoridectomies, shock therapy,

radical mastectomy, forced
sterilization, hysterectomy,
incarceration in mental

institutions and other prisons as
well as violence done to womyn
in their homes, beds, on the
street and in the media.

Working with WAR gave me a
place to write, speak publicly,
and talk with other feminist

womyn. I gained a sense of
self-worth, being needed, and
confidence. I was growing
stronger, more self-respecting

and politicized to other
struggles. When I look back over
the two years I worked with
WAR, I see that that process
radicalized me. My observations
of police, courts, and raped
women forced truths on me
which I was, at times, not at all
sure I wanted to face. Other
womyn in WAR and my work
on issues of violence against
womyn challenged my long-held
views of womyn, male-female
relationships, the legal system,
adult-child relationships, class
and race, and the penal system.
For two years we talked, read,
observed rape and violence
against womyn in a
socio-political context. I am left
with a great respect and love of
the womyn that went through
this process with me.

The following are some of the
services that WAR offered from

four years ago until today: A
24-hour hotline, a rape-crisis
drop-in center, statistics
gathered on the incidence of
rape and domestic violence that
came through our hotline or
center, a rape support group for
teenage womyn, a speakers
bureau, training sessions for
Emergency Rooms and police,
support for womyn through rape
trauma and court trauma,
support to change Vermont's

rape laws, and self-defense
courses. In the fall of 1975,
WAR decided to officially

publicize the extension of its
services to include domestic
violence calls. During the next
months many womyn and their
children, victims of being beaten
by the womyn’s spouses, were
housed in our homes.

The task of providing the
needed support and services to
these raped and beaten womyn
proved overwhelming. There
were nearly 20 womyn
volunteers in the organization at
this time. We did almost daily
speaking engagements and had
three or four calls a day to the
hotline or drop-in center. What
developed in Burlington
happened in other womyn’s
violence crisis groups across the
country. Frustration grew as our
energies were drained. The
long-term support needed for
these womyn and the incredible
amount of energy needed to
maintain a hotline and continue
our other services proved

beyond the capability of a small
volunteer organization.
Furthermore, as feminists we
wanted to determine what was
our effect on the Burlington
community and what we could
do to lower the incidence of
rape. We became more frustrated
with treating the after-effects of
rape and domestic violence
instead of stopping this violence.
We considered the possible
publication of a list of accused
rapists or a photo campaign to
make their faces known to
Burlington womyn. We
considered patrolling the streets,
pushing the Burlington public
school system to train young
womyn in self-defense, focusing
primarily on self-defense and
other preventative measures.
Women Against Rape had long
meetings about how we could
change our image from a social
service agency to a
counter-action group. We talked
about the possibility of forming
two groups, one that would keep
the name WAR and maintain the
hotline, counsel, and the rest of
the aforementioned services and
a second group that would teach
self-defense, be more
outrageous, forceful, and angry.
I believe that would have been a

good decision.

However, there was
considerable disagreement
within WAR throughout this
period, over this issue and
others. The question of
endorsement of a
male-dominated leftist group

produced some bad feelings. A
struggle to provide regular paid
child care was worked through.
A political discussion about
whether it was sexism or
capitalism at the root of all
oppression split the group. Soon
after this a struggle concerning
membership further created
tensions and anger. Yet each of
these processes was a valuable

learning experience. Mistakes
were made, hard feelings
developed, but I believe it is

important for us all to review
this political process and discuss
it.

WAR Burlington is at a point
of crisis now. The issue of
whether to provide needed
services to womyn who have had
violence done to them, and/or to
try to work on more
preventative measures still has
not been resolved. WAR
membership has dwindled to a
few overburdened womyn. I
want to see this organization
thrive again. Although county
and city agencies have been
educated by the work of the
womyn’s movement as to some
of the needs of raped womyn,
I’ll never trust that their focus
will always have the womyn’s
needs in the forefront. I want
WAR in Burlington to continue
to provide womyn with a
feminist perspective they will get
nowhere else.

There are many womyn who
could benefit from a similar
process to the one I went
through in those two years.
Womyn working together is an
invaluable experience. I know
there are many womyn who
need this process. I hope that
womyn reading this will join the
newly expanding organization.

There is a group of four or five
womyn who have agreed to do a
new training session, or rather
share the information and skills
collected in these four years that
are necessary to the forming of a
new group. There is an office
and records in the cellar space of
the Women's House of
Transition, a refuge for battered
women and children. (This
organization also needs money,
support, and workers.)

The phone number of WAR is
863-1236. Watch for publicity
about the upcoming training
session. If you have even a small
amount of time and energy,
consider WAR as a possible
focus.

Women
and
Society

By Julie Orvis

A “Women and Society
Symposium” will be sponsored
Friday, March 23, through
Sunday, March 25, by St.
Michael's College in Winooski;
the symposium is part of St.
Michael's celebration of its
jubilee year. Buff Lindau and
Carrie Kaplan, the coordinators,
have pulled together a
symposium which is
interdisciplinary.

At first look, however, the
program, workshops and lectures
seem terribly academic. Kaplan
points out that the symposium,
the largest event of this nature
ever to happen at St. Michael's,
is intended to make women’s
studies academically legitimate.

Pat Carbine of Ms. magazine
will give the opening speech on
the “Changing Roles of Women”
on March 23, at 1:30 p.m. At 5
p.m., Lisa Alther, author of
Kinflicks, will do a reading. In
the evening, the Gudde Dancers
will be featured at 8 p.m., with a
reception afterward to meet the
dancers.

Twice on March 24, Joanne
Rathgeb, Equity actor, will
perform The Belle of Amherst.
At 5:30 p.m., Grace Paley,
author of Little Disturbances of
Man, will do a reading, and at
8:30 p.m. Dr. Rosalyn Yalow,
1977 Nobel Laureate, will give
the keynote speech.

Some of the workshops
include: “The Religious Woman:
An Historical View,” “Image of
Women in Literature,” “Women
and the Arts,” “Women and
Music,” “Social Issues of
Aging,” “Feminism and
Science,” “Feminism and
Humor,” “The Politics of
Reproduction,” “The Morality
of Feminism,” “Feminist
Utopian Fiction,” “Language
and Feminism” and “The
Women’s Movement in
Burlington: A Local Report.”

There will be films shown
continuously on Saturday and a
display of books related to
women’s studies.

The registration fee is $25,
which includes meals, tickets to
the Gudde Dancers, and
proceedings of the conference
to be published later.
