CALL FOR  
MATERIAL  

Out From Under:  
and Our Friends  

This is to announce a call  
for material for a new anthology  
under contract for publication in  
1983. The anthology will draw  
together, for the first time, the  
stories and dreams of those of us  
involved with recovery from  
alcoholism or drug addiction.  

We want to hear from  

“women. The giving, making,  
and clean lives, in lesbian com-  
munities as well as in communi-  
ties of our birth cultures and  
classes. This is a call for material  
from any woman who:  
—has become a clean and  
—sober dyke.  
—loves clean  
dykes  
—wants to live in a commu-  
nity where there is strength and  
joy and the beginning of an end  
to victimization in lesbian lives.  
We are looking for articles  
and artwork in almost any style:  
journals, letters, fiction, autobio-  
graphy, poetry, interviews, dia-  
logues, theory, nonfiction, narra-  
tives, diaries, songs, speeches,  
graphics, paintings or photo-  
graphy. We are interested in  
seeing anything honest that is  
not sloganeering or rhetoric.  
If you need help getting  
started, here are some questions:  
If you are recovering: How  
did you? How long has it been?  
What are you feeling now? How  
is your sex life? What are your  
dreams, your sources of joy?  
If you are a significant  

Sober Dykes  

and sober  

“other: What did you see? What  

did you feel? And now? How  
has your life changed? What  
were/are your struggles, your  
joys?  

If you want a clean and  
sober community: Are there  
political connections? What is  
your community? Is it drugged?  
What is the alternative to a  
future built on numbness?  
Where is the solace to a past  
lived in pain?  

Tell us, tell us:  
we need to know

We are producing a film  
about lesbians who decide to  
have children after they've come  
out. Although there are lesbians  
who’ve done this, the topic  
remains largely undiscussed and  
very few resources on the  
subject exist. Occasional articles  
appear and support groups have  
sprung up in some urban areas.  
The documentary film we are  
making will start to fill in this  
gap by providing specific infor-  
mation (how people get preg-  
nant, legal ramifications, etc.),  
role models for lesbians con-  
sidering becoming mothers, and  
a context in which to think  
about the questions which arise.  

We are writing to ask your  
readers for their help. We are  
looking for lesbians who have  
had children since coming out;  
are pregnant; or are seriously  
considering motherhood. We  
would like to hear from as many  
women as possible, both those  
who might be willing to appear  
in the film as well as from those  

who would not. All of your  
stories will help us shape the  
film’s content.  

If you are involved in a  

pregnancy (yourself or as a  
friend or lover of a lesbian who  
is) please write us or pass this  
request on to someone who  
is. Once we hear from you, we'll  
explain the project and what  
we'd like to know in greater  
depth. All information we  
receive will be confidential. Our  
address is 46 Bay State Avenue,  
No. 2, Somerville, MA 02144.

New Guide to Colleges Published  
by Feminists  

Washington — A new guide  
to the nation’s colleges answers  
such questions as how many  
rapes were reported on campus,  
whether day care for children is  
available and what percentage of  
student and faculty leaders is  
female.  

It's called Everywoman  
Guide to Colleges and Uni-  
versities, and is published by the  
Feminist Press of Old Westbury,  
N.Y. with help from a branch of  
the U.S. Department of Educa-  
tion and the Carnegie Corpora-  
tion.  

Although the more than 6  
million women attending U.S.  
colleges outnumber male stu-  
dents, other guides are written  
as though the universal student  
was male, says one of the  
book's editors, Florence Howe.  

Ms. Howe, a professor of  
humanities at the State Univer-  
sity of New York and co-direc-  
tor of the Feminist Press, put  
the book together with a team  
of educational consultants.  

She said it offers answers to  
questions ignored in standard  
guides and includes such matters  
as the availability of health and  
counseling services for women;  
safety and security on campus,  
including the number of rapes  
and assaults reported in  
1980-81; faculty-student “gen-  
der” ratios; policies against  
sexual harassment; the percen-  
tage of women in non-traditional  
majors such as architecture,  
engineering, computer science  
and theology; the most popular  
major for women; the percen-  
tage of student leaders who are  
women, and the percentage of  
women on the faculty and in top  
administrative jobs.  

The guide awards up to  
three stars in each of five cate-  
gories: the curriculum; athletics;  
the percentage of women leaders  
among the students, on the  
faculty and in the administra-  
tion.  

No college got a perfect  
score of 15 stars but one of the  
Seven Sisters schools, Wellesley  
College in Massachusetts, came  
close. It garnered 14 stars,  
missing only one star for an  

Community Women's Center  
200 Main St. Burlington, Vt. 06401  

athletics program described as  
excellent.  

Like Wellesley, the runners-  
up were all female schools:  
Smith College in Northampton,  
Mass., 12 stars; Hood College in  
Frederick, Md., and Barnard  
College in New York, 11. A bevy  
of colleges got 10 stars, inclu-  
ding Mount Holyoke in South  
Hadley, Mass.; Georgian Court in  
Lakewood, N.J.; Carlow College  
in Pittsburgh; Barat College in  
Lake Forest, Ill.; Mills College in  
Oakland, Calif.; St. Joseph's  
College in Hartford; Mundelein  
College in Chicago; Marymount  
College in Tarrytown, N.Y. and  
the College of New Rochelle,  
N.Y.  

The highest scoring coedu-  
cational campuses were the  
University of California-  
Berkeley, Ohio State University  
and Towson State University  
in Maryland, all of which got  
eight stars. Berkeley and Ohio  
State each got three stars for  
student leadership, three for  
curriculum and two for athletics.  

“indoctrinated into the  
world of witches, occult and  
lesbianism” at a house filled with  
mirrors and surrounded by high weeds.  

The child’s mother, chiropractor Laura M. Tran, 26, of Atla-  
dena, is representing herself but did not attend Friday's hearing.  
A message left at her office  
phone number is not listed.  

“Purdy came home and told me,  
‘Jesus is bad;’ ‘Daddy is  
bad;’” Tran said, adding  
that he had performed a  
“minor exorcism” on the child by a  
Roman Catholic priest.  

Mrs. Tran filed for divorce Aug. 5 after a five-year marriage.

Commonwomon editors wish to point out that the word  
“prick” is derived from “witchprickers” who were people who  
pointed out or identified witches. Meanwhile, the Free Press  
has had a series of articles on a fundamentalist church in Grand  
Isle that encourages its membership to beat their children until  
they bleed.

FOR COMMUNITY EDUCATION  
WAYS TO WORK: A VOCATIONAL PROGRAM  

The UVM Church Street Center, with grant support from the Vermont  
State Department of Education, is offering a vocational program for  
homemakers and other disadvantaged adults. The program offers  
enrollment in career planning, personal growth and vocational  
skills courses; individual career counseling; a volunteer work place-  
ment; support group participation; limited child-care assistance; and  
help in acquiring a job placement. The program will require 10-30 hours  
of active participation each week, depending on the individual's needs  
and the phase of the program. Between ten and fourteen participants  
will be chosen. Application forms, available at the Church Street  
Center, must be submitted by Wednesday, December 23, 1982.  

It is the aim of the program to assist participants in identifying personal  
goals and a sense of direction and commitment, to give the participant  
an opportunity to acquire useful job skills, to introduce the participant  
to a work situation, to create a group which can support its members as  
they go beyond what they perceive their own limitations, and to assist  
participants in finding satisfactory work placements.  

*The Vermont Department of Education ensures equal employment  
and educational opportunities regardless of race, color, creed, age,  
handicap, national origin or sex; in compliance with federal and state

laws.  

The highest scoring coeducational campuses were the  
University of California-  
Berkeley, Ohio State University  
and Towson State University  
in Maryland, all of which got  
eight stars. Berkeley and Ohio  
State each got three stars for  
student leadership, three for  
curriculum and two for athletics.  

Speaking as THE LADIES,  
Commonwomon editors would  
like to quote Mother Jones who  
said god made women and the  
Rockefeller gang of thieves made  
ladies.
