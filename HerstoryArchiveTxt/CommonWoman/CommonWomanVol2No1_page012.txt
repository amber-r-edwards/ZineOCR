“WOMEN RISING”

By Mary Schwartz  
the weekend of  

Over  
December 19, an art exhibit of  
Vermont women artists, called  
“Women Rising,” was held at  
the Women’s Center on Langdon  
Street in Montpelier. The show  

was organized by Marie  
LaPre-Grabon, with Margaret  
Lew and Franci McMahan, and  
grew out of frustration over the  
difficulty of finding places that  
will exhibit women’s work. The  
artists were gathered by using  
lists from art organizations and  
referrals from friends and other  
artists as well as through radio,  
newspaper and poster  
advertising.  

The title of the show gives  
some hint of feminist themes,  
but the feminism resides more in  
the amount of effort needed to  
find women artists and exhibit  
their work, and in the politics of  
the opening, which was for  
women only, than in the themes  
of the work. At this point it is  
probably superfluous to mention  
that the women-only policy of  
the opening resulted in its being  
picketed by a small number of  
men and women suffering from  
reverse discrimination blues, a  
form of post-sexual-revolutionary  
hypochondria.  

The show included paintings,  
photography, prints, drawings  
and crafts, with painting and  
photography dominating. The  
work was not juried, but  
nevertheless was overall of very  
good quality and worth a more  
extended showing than over a  
long weekend. It would certainly  
be beneficial if there could be  
more exhibits of women’s work  
in the future, not only for the  
benefit of the artists themselves,  
but also for the general public,  
which has few — enough  
opportunities to see art in  
Vermont. Shows of from one to  
three artists’ work at a time  
would be particularly desirable,  
rather than the hodgepodge that  
a large group show inevitably  
presents. It would also be good  
if more three-dimensional work  
by artists in sculpture and crafts  
can be found.

“Women Rising,” the first  
annual Vermont women’s art  
show, opened in December at  
the Central Vermont Women’s  
Center in Montpelier. The center  
is located, ironically enough,  
two floors above the Onion  
River Sporting Goods Store, a  
traditionally symbolic male  
bastion if there ever was one.  
And like the proverbial petunia  
in the onion patch, the show  
proved to be a small brave dot of

An Opinion  

color in an otherwise hostile  
environment, a pungent,  
strangulating environment  

dedicated to the proposition  
that all men are created equal,  
and all women are created less  
equal than men, existing on a  
lower, less significant and,  
certainly, less valid plane.  
Weedlike, an eleventh-hour  
controversy sprang up over the  
fact that men were not allowed  
to attend the four-hour opening  
of “Women Rising,” even  

though the entire public was  
invited to view the exhibit  
during a total of fourteen hours  
after the formal opening. The  
exhibit was boycotted by a  
group of men and women who  
evidently have access to a  
typewriter and a Xerox machine  
(in that what I saw of their  
protest consisted of their milling  
about the door of the Women’s  
Center, thrusting a lengthy,  
cliché-filled and poorly written  
statement of purpose at those  

entering the exhibition, while  
muttering, “Want one of  
these?”), but who do not possess  
the courage of their convictions  
to the extent that they would  
sign their names.  

Thus, the title “Women  
Rising” becomes, sadly and  
unfortunately, a wistful, wishful  
hope for the future, instead of  
the descriptive statement of the  
present that it was intended to  
be. Those anonymous protestors  
have effectively thwarted the  

goal of women artists and  
women art lovers to rise at least  
to the level of their male  
counterparts in this society.  
Their boycott demonstrates  
nothing more than a juvenile  
me-too attitude, and an  
absolutely appalling lack of  
consciousness.  

When inequities and  
oppression have been so  
ingrained in a society that their

Seabrook  
Appeals  

By Bear  
On Monday, January 15, the  
first of 300 antinuclear  
protestors started the appeal  
process on their convictions for  
criminal trespass in connection  

with the May 1, 1977,  
demonstration against  
construction of the Seabrook  
nuclear power plant.  

Twenty-five people a day are  
being arraigned in Rockingham  
County (N.H.) Superior Court  
for three weeks; I will be among  
them.  

All of us have been convicted  
at least once in Hampton  
District Court and sentenced to  
two weeks in jail and a $100  
fine. At this arraignment we will  
be charged and must enter a  
plea. A guilty plea or failure to  
appear would remand us to  
District Court and to jail under  
the old sentence. A plea of not  
guilty continues the appeal  
process.  

Other protestors who have  
been tried in Superior Court  
have received stiff sentences of  
three to six months in jail and  
$200 fines. The prosecutor in  
the case, Carlton Eldridge, has  
said, however, that there is some  
chance that the charges may be  
dropped by the state because of  
public apathy.  

Burlington Clamshell  
members have pointed out that  
this series of arraignments is  
timed to coincide with the  
opening of the “Clam Congress”  
on January 25. The Congress is a  
gathering at which policy  
decisions and plans for future  
demonstrations will be made.  
Clamshell members have stated  
that the timing is an obvious  
ploy to intimidate the Clamshell  
Alliance to keep it from  
planning new demonstrations.
