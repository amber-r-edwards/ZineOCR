CONVERSATION WITH  
PEG FERNANDEZ:  

FEMINIST  
THERAPY  

(The following is an edited  
transcript of a conversation  
between Dian Kendrick Mueller,  
a member of the Common-  
woman collective, and Peg  
Fernandez, a psychotherapist  
with the Center for Change in  
South Burlington, Vt. This is the  

first in a series on feminist  
therapy.)  
PEG FERNANDEZ: Your  

question — when you called and  
asked if anyone here considered  
themselves a feminist therapist —  
came as a surprise, because I've  
never thought of it in those  

terms. So I'll tell you what I  
understand myself to be and —  
I'll call myself a feminist  

therapist and see if it fits what  
other people think.  

I’m a therapist, a  
psychotherapist, not a  
psychologist or a psychiatrist. I  
work with men and with  
women. About being a feminist — I  
guess what I consider in me  
that’s feminist is that I think  
that women as a whole in the  
United States are in the midst of  
a big change, and it’s a necessary  
and inevitable change, and the  
change as I see it is from being  
passive, dependent people to  
being self-sufficient and being  
more active, not depending on  
anybody to take care of them or  
to meet their emotional needs  
without there having to be some  
kind of trade-off or bargain.  

I think women are becoming  
more in touch with what their  
needs really are, not willing to  
accept a bill of goods sold to  
them by Walt Disney, for  
example — being good little girls  
and waiting and being patient  
and taking whatever comes along  
the pike, and if they wait long  
enough their prince will come.  

I think they’re becoming  
more aware that they've been  
dissatisfied for a long time and  
that the trade-off hasn’t worked.  
The trade-off that I speak of is —  
when you think of the way  
women in the United States  
traditionally have been with  
men, it’s been to be in a passive  
position, to accept a lot of abuse  
— sexual abuse, physical abuse,  
emotional abuse — because that  
was what was expected, they  
were supposed to stay home and  
take it and there was no other  
choice. I think that’s one of the  
big changes that’s happened —  
women are becoming more  
educated than that, they don’t  
have to accept that and they’re  
not going to.  

DIAN KENDRICK MUELLER:  

And how does this affect men?  

As a therapist who holds these  

beliefs, when you treat men how  

does this come into play? I  

mean, are they still expecting  
that women will in fact be the  
standard model?  
PEG: A few — not many. Of  
course, you must understand  
that the people who come to  
therapy are usually somewhat  
more sophisticated, so I imagine  
it’s not truly representative of  
the proportion of men who are  
beginning to accept the change.  
DIAN: But you would say that  
most of the men you see are  
accepting that there is a change?  
PEG: They’re at least  
acknowledging that there’s a  
change and that they have to  
deal with it — they're not  
pretending that it’s not  
happening. A lot of them don’t  
like it. I think a few years ago  
the predominant attitude was  
feeling ripped-off and angry that  
the change was happening, and  
now it’s not so much that, but  
trying to cope with it, trying to  
understand what to do to meet  
it.  
DIAN: I wonder if this comes  
from a real insight into what's  
happening or a necessary  
adjustment because this is  
happening? Say I’m a man and  
okay, first I get angry, as you  
said, then I see that’s not going  
to help because these changes  
are happening. I can see I might  
have several different reactions,  
but two are: one, I would begin  
to try to understand what's  
happening and why, and I might  
want to go into therapy to help  
me deal with that, and, two, I  
might think that, gee, I don’t  
like this but I'm going to have to  
adjust to it because that’s the  
way things are. Is either one of  
those something that men come  
in with?  
PEG: I think probably it's both.  
The men that I see — very few of  
them come in to deal with their  
problems with the changes that  
are going on in women; it’s  
usually part of the package they  
come in with — you know,  
something is not right in their  
lives and they want to change it.  
I think men are becoming aware  
on a kind of instinctual level  
that things have changed and  
some of them focus on what the  
change is and deal with it in  
whatever their way is, by  
becoming enraged, or by finding  
other women (very often the  
women they've been in  
relationships with change and  
they're not willing to accept the  
change so they find women who  
haven’t changed yet), or by  
changing themselves. A lot of  
men are changing themselves,  
DIAN: Are you saying that men  
change both because they want  
to change and because they have  

to change?  
PEG: It depends on the person. I  
don’t think I can give a blanket  
answer to that. Some of the men  
I know want to change — they  
understand that the way it’s  
been all along is unequal and  
unfair and are interested in  
having a peer relationship.  
Others are more resentful and  
they drag their heels and  
eventually accept and adjust to  
the fact that they’re not into  
changing themselves.  

DIAN: I think it would be  
helpful to both of us if I defined  
my idea of feminism. I think of  
feminism as becoming fully  
human, for both women and  
men. I do think that men have  
been defined as the human so far  
in our history — what is human  

is man, “mankind.” And women  

somehow have been put in a  
separate category — they're  
“women,” they're not human  
beings. So, from a woman's  
point of view, feminism is  
becoming a human being — just  
to be accepted by our culture as  
human, not as some “other.”  
But on top of this, I think that  
what happened at some point in  
our history is that we took  
humanity and divided it into  
two halves and gave one half to  
men - the aggressive,  
breadwinner stuff, and the other  
half to women — the tender, the  
compassionate, the nurturing  
mother. And we have punished  
people for not staying within  
their defined roles.  

There are therapists who say  
that we have within us both the  
male and the female, and that  
we have to reconcile those two  
polarities, not just be  
brainwashed into leaving half of  
ourselves behind.  

PEG: I'm kind of relieved to  
hear what your definition of  
feminism is; I’m perfectly  
comfortable with that  
definition. I have experienced in  
the past people that I would  
consider radical feminists doing  
the inverse of what’s been done  
to women — cancelling out the  
other half. And this to me is  
lowering women to the tactics  
that men have used.  

DIAN: I don’t consider myself a  
“radical” feminist. The only way  
I'm radical is to think that  
women are human beings — and  
that is radical in our society. I  
think that we are all human  
beings — I have a husband and  
two sons (as well as a daughter)  
and I don’t want to relegate  
them to the same position  
women have been in all these  
thousands of years. I would like

Cloisonne Crafts  

BOSHA  

I had two very conflicting  
images of China that I hoped to  
clarify in talking with Bosha.  
One image was of China as a  
land of robots; “red China," a  
nation where everybody thought  
the same, and dressed the same;  
where nobody was allowed  
freedom. The other  
image was of a nation that had  
had the ‘perfect people’s  
revolution’ — Mao’s China. I  
formed this conception in the  
late 1960s when I was studying  
Marxist-Leninist-Maoist  

philosophy, learning and  
identifying with socialist  
ideologies.  

Neither of these images that I  
had of China included any  
visions of women, or of women’s  
issues. A lot of my questioning  
of Bosha, other than towards the  
dispelling and/or validating of  
my old myths, had to do  
specifically with women in  
China.  

Much of what I learned in  
talking with Bosha has been hard  
for me to believe, assimilate,  
accept, without my cynicism  
bred in our over-industrialized  
and problem-plagued nation. I  
had to work hard at imagining...  

Imagine a whole nation where  
women are not sexually  
objectified! Bosha said that  
never while she was there was  
her body talked about, leered at,  
grabbed at. This doesn’t happen  
to women in China. None of  
those ‘little rapes’, the  
comments, suggestions, name  
calling, and NO RAPE! NO  
PROSTITUTION! NO  
PORNOGRAPHY! I asked  
Bosha why she thought this was  
so. She said, ‘People have  
tremendous personal respect and  
affection for each other. Women  
are respected.’  

Bosha met with a group called  
the National Federation of  
Women who purported to  
represent the neighborhood and  
national concerns of women in  
their region. These women  
stressed changes; that it is a  
dying out custom that men  
expect to be served. In 1973 the  
party Central Committee issued  
a decree stating that housework  

be done by men as well as  
women. They (the Federation)  
said they felt their  
organizational reason for  
existence was to “keep down  

male superiority.” A major  
concern expressed was that  
women want a place in  
production. (Production = paid  
work = power.)  

Everybody works!  

Everybody works six days a  
week. And workplaces? Here we  
talked mostly about factories.  
China is involved in a national  
development program they call  
“The Four Modernizations.”  
These are science, technology,  
education, and national defense.  
China, in moving towards  
becoming an industrialized  
nation, is hopefully, Bosha felt,  
showing a greater concern for  
ecology than the western nations  
have shown. She visited one  

chemical plant that had an  
extensive recycling system for  
byproducts.  

Both women and men work in  
factories. Stereotypical sex-role  
placement did not seem evident  
here. Bosha mentioned a sewing  

factory in which there were  
many men operating sewing  
machines. (This is one  
occupation that in the United  
States, for example, is  
traditionally female.) 99% of  
housewives take part in  
production, many at  

neighborhood factories that are  
run mostly by women. She  
visited factories that had women  
doing fine crafts work — bottle  
painting, jade inlay. This work  
was mostly for export. There  
are, as incentives, higher pay  
scales for women doing what  
were traditionally male jobs.  
Bosha talked about the  
workplace conditions as seeming  
highly favorable to the worker.  
There were notable exceptions  
to this however, with lighting  
being in many places quite poor.  
Safety precautions are good.  
Female workers have paid time  
off for menstruating, as well as  
for pregnancies.  

All young children, rural and  
urban, can attend day care  
centers. These day care centers
