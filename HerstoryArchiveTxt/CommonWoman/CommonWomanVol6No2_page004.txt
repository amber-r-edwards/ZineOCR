Akwesasne In Crisis

Akwesasne Notes, a journal
for Native and Natural Peoples
published by Mohawk Nation in
upstate New York, needs help.

communication is in danger of
freezing up. The work of Native
Peoples to control their own
destiny and fight for justice is
growing and intensifying. The
Notes is very involved in and
necessary to that work. If you
can help, do it today. In addi-
tion to financial help, these
things are needed for The Notes:

boots and shoes, working type-
writer, desks, index cards, blue
pencils, film strip projector,
scissors, film, 35mm camera,
hearing-aid batteries. Please,

Planned Parenthood Sponsors
Abortion Survey

A statewide survey by Altonia
Research Associates showed that
83 percent of Vermonters favored
abortion decisions be made in a
private consultation between
patient and physician, while only
eight percent felt abortion
decisions should be regulated by
law.

The survey also revealed a
range of Vermont attitudes about
sexuality education in schools,
social problems, and the role of
Planned Parenthood.

Sexuality education in public
schools was supported five to
one. Fifty-eight percent said
they felt sexuality education
should begin in elementary
school.

Teenage pregnancy was viewed
as one of the most serious social
problems, second only to a
concern over violent crime.

When asked what they thought
about Planned Parenthood as an
organization, ninety percent
thought it was a good thing for
the community.

From 1917 through 1920,
she was a suffragette. Now Mary
Greer, 84, is back in the protest
line, this time for the Equal
Rights Amendment. She journeyed
to Tallahassee with dozens of
other women to present Florida’s
senators with “petitions for
equality” favoring ratification.

“Just take a look in there,”
said the tiny, energetic woman
dressed all in the symbolic green
of ERA backers and layered in
“ERA-YES” buttons. She gestured
towards the House chamber where
state senators and representatives
were assembled to hear Gov. Bob
Graham speak.

“It’s nearly all men,” Ms.
Greer said, “...If the Equal
Rights Amendment had been part
of the original Constitution, all
our laws and institutions would
have been much different.”

Remember all those 59 cent
buttons declaring that women
earned 59 cents to every $1 that
a man earned? Well, we find
these are outdated now. According
to the Department of Labor's
latest statistics, we need to order
some 57 cent buttons!

And this is the age of progress?

Karate Revenge on Cheating
Husbands

Antofagasta, Chile — Men
who cheat on their wives are
being attacked and undressed by
a roving “hit squad” of female
karate experts.

Wearing ski masks and using
karate to overwhelm their victims,
a group of women called the
Feminist Movement of El Loa has
in the past few months attacked
at least 10 men, including a
husband caught necking with his
mistress in an automobile on a
deserted beach.

‘We want everyone to know
that here in northern Chile it’s
not easy to cheat on, or abuse,
us women,” said one unidentified
member of the self-described “hit
squad.”

"We find out when an unfaithful
man has a date, and we follow
them to the scene. We surprise
them and humiliate them so
they'll learn to be better
husbands,” she said.

Unfaithful husbands are not
the only victims. The karate
experts said their main concern
is making the streets safer for
women to walk alone at night.

A recent victim of the female
karate squad was a taxi driver
known to attack women passengers.
The karate squad caught him in
his taxi and “taught him a few
lessons.” The incident was
published in the local paper.

‘We want all those machos out
there to know what it’s like to
be afraid to walk on the streets
at night,’’ one squad member said
in an interview with a local
journalist on a deserted beach
about 1000 miles north of the
capital of Santiago.

The man caught cheating on his
wife in a parked car said he was
attacked and undressed by the
karate squad.

‘I’m on their list now, and I
can tell you that since that
incident occurred, I have
remained totally faithful to my
wife,’ the man said.

Chronicle, Feb. 16, 1982)

Lesbian Mothers

Artificial insemination by
donor (AID) needn’t be the
complicated procedure that the
health profession often makes it
out to be. For lesbians who wish
to become mothers, AID can be
done at home safely and easily if
just a few precautions are
followed. Those are the conclusions
of Gillian Hanscombe and Jackie
Forster, authors of the forthcoming
book Rocking the Cradle: Lesbian
Mothers, a Challenge in Family
Living. The book is based on their
interviews with lesbian mothers of
all ages and backgrounds, and
provides the most comprehensive
look ever at how and why lesbians
become mothers, and the social
problems facing those who do.

Rocking the Cradle will be
published this Mother’s Day by
Alyson Publications. Interested
readers can find it in bookstores,
or may order it by mail for
$5.95 plus 75 cents postage
from Alyson Publications, PO
Box 2783, Boston, MA 02208.

Hospital Takeover

A friend from Boston reports:
‘Yesterday we went to a meeting
called by Physicians for Social
Responsibility. Seems the Pentagon
has asked civilian hospitals to
support a plan to make 50,000
beds available nationwide with 48
hours to two weeks notice. The
beds are for casualties which are
to be sustained in a major battle
not in the continental U.S. and
the plan has been presented to
these hospitals without notifying
Congress or the media.”

Soldier Killed in War Games

FORT IRWIN, Calif (AP) —
Gunfire killed one soldier and
wounded three others during
live-fire war games at this Mojave
Desert training base, the Army
said Monday.

A fifth soldier was injured
scrambling out of an armored
personnel carrier during the
incident about 7 p.m., Sunday,
authorities said.

“Preliminary investigation
indicates the fatality was caused
by small arms fire,” said Bob
Hughes, a spokesman at the
base. "Three of the injured
soldiers received light wounds
from small arms bullet fragments
and were admitted to Weed Army
Community Hospital at Fort Irwin
where their condition was listed
as good.

“One soldier injured his knee
while leaving an armored personnel
vehicle during the incident and
also is in good condition.”

The Army could provide no
further details of how the
accident occurred, he said.
