COMMONWOMAN/NOVEMBER, 1981

By Barbara Hirschfeld

Michigan. The sound of the
word has become a call to the
no longer a state of the
union, but a state of mind.

Michigan. Once a year she
rises like Atlantis from the ocean
of our dreams; and as images
from the sixth annual Michigan
Womyn's Music Festival fade out
of our immediate vision, the
rippling repercussions can be felt
in our lives—and our increasingly
grandiose dreams. Our culture
takes a quantum leap each year,
as we witness how far we've
come, how our nation has
grown, how our furthest fan-
tasies have taken shape in this
special space. We entwine the
strands of our diverse selves into
one strong rope, Michigan, that
we can hold on to in the seasons
to come, that will keep us sane,
less prejudiced, less fragmented
than we were before, that will
keep us remembering the dream,
Michigan.

The first year you go ga-ga,
watching all the girls go by,
watching the waves of women,
wondering—where you are,
actually. The second year you
are returning, amazed this place
is still here, the same paths to
the same trees, and some fami-
liar faces, gotten wilder in a
year. You are participating in a
civilization out of time, out of
space. Haven't you always been
here, with the drumbeats sound-
ing through the trees? You begin
to take more responsibility for
its functioning well; you lead
workshops, you do workshifts,
you reach out to others.

The Festival is more than a
musical event, although without
the music where would we be?
Music has been the key to our
culture; true to our revolutionary
heritage, the oral tradition
has carried the message, “Blessed
with the right to be.” How far
we are from Lavendar Jane,
when most of us were in iso-
lation and couldn't believe our
ears, to now, this marvelous
event where 7,000 women stand
up with Sweet Honey in the
Rock and “call her name: mama,
sister, daughter, lover.” Edwina
Lee Tyler said it so well when
she stood before us in the sun,
her African cloth wrapped
around her head, after present-
ing us with such passionate
drumming and dancing that we
were all ready to leap into the
air. “Think of me, not as a
woman who plays the drum, but
a woman with a heart; I love
you!” How many of us burst
into tears as our hearts burst
open in love and joy. Yes,
music can set your heart free.

But it’s not just the music,
it’s the women. 8,000 of us,
co-operating, being considerate
of each other, and of the land.
When someone asks you to move
out of the way, you respect their
request. You do it. Last year,

1981

several requests and proposals
were made, to help make the
Festival more accessible to
women of color, women with no
money, women without tents.
Every suggestion which I remem-
ber being read over the micro-
phone last year I saw carried out
this year. There were commu-
nity tents, a blanket bank, a
political tent which helped
women of different ethnic back-
grounds meet each other. An
atmosphere of helpfulness pre-
vailed, reaching out across all
kinds of distinctions. A high
point of the weekend for me was
a workshop led by three beauti-
ful deaf women, explaining their
language to us. I wanted so
much to talk to these women
that I vowed by next year to
have learned enough American
Sign Language to converse.

But it’s not just the incred-
ibly high level of cooperation, it’s
the culture. The once small
“merchant” tent had expanded
into two tents and an outside
space where an enormous variety
of extraordinary womyn-
oriented craft work was dis-
played, a womyn’s bazaar to
rival the Orient! It would
be worthwhile to start saving
your quarters (pennies will never
do) for next year, and do all
your shopping at Michigan!

As for the music, every style
was represented; punk rock, soul
music in the old style, guitar and
vocalist solos, the unmatched
uniqueness of “tivel,” the com-
pellingly different style of Ibis
and the Harp-Band. It must be
wonderful to be a musician at
Michigan; nowhere else have I
seen such excellent lighting or
heard such high quality sound.

One night it rained and
rained and rained. The audience
hung in there, dancing in the
rain to “We Are Family.” Then
we watched as a crew of over
30 women covered the stage
with plastic, made a plastic slide
for the water to pour through,
dropped the center pole of the
huge Nightstage tent, and easily
let gallons of water fall neatly
off the canvas roof without
touching a bit of the electrical
equipment. The crowd cheered.
We were truly impressed. Im-
pressed with ourselves, our num-
bers, our technology, our music,
our culture, our diversity, our
love, our power.

After Terry Garthwaite’s
send-off number, “Did ya ever
get your ticket to go,” we drove
off into the Michigan night. It
seemed we could still hear the
cheering of thousands of
womyn’s voices as we sped along
the highway in the light of
mother moon.

REVIEW

Michigan Again

Sweet Honey

By Dee Babcock
Historically, music has
served as a medium for oppress-
ed peoples. Today the music of
Sweet Honey in the Rock
continues this powerful oral
tradition. On October 3, 1981, a
capacity crowd gathered in the
University of Vermont's Ira
Allen Chapel to hear a concert.
Instead they received a timely
message in song.

The ambience of the room
was transformed as the four
women of Sweet Honey in the
Rock lifted their voices to
produce rhythms and harmonies
rivaled only by nature. The
breadth of Sweet Honey in the
Rock's music strives to span the
gulf between Africa and her
estranged children by capturing
the richness and struggles of a
proud and powerful nation in
chants, hymns, and other songs
of praise.

In contrast to the apolitical
trend in the establishment music
industry, the music of Sweet
Honey in the Rock mirrors the
audience to abandon apathy,
hatred, destruction, and racism
in order to realign themselves
with life.

A Washington, DC based
theatre group's desire to bring its
music and message to the people
gave birth to Sweet Honey in the
Rock. In 1973, Sweet Honey in
the Rock began appearing in
local festivals and concerts that
featured folk and other tradi-
tional music. In 1977, Road
Works, a Washington, DC
Women’s production company,
began promoting the group in
the women’s music circle.

During their eight-year
sojourn, Sweet Honey in the
Rock has been recording on the
Flying Fish label. A new album,
Good News, recorded live at
their seventh anniversary con-
cert, is soon to be released. What
started as a two-weekend, 4
month, local commitment has
now become an extensive
national and international tour.

Their voices, feet, and hands
became instruments as they
admonished members of the
audience to abandon apathy,
hatred, destruction, and racism
in order to realign themselves
with life.

Tell Me a Riddle is a first
film by the all-women God-
mother Productions Co. Direc-
ted by Lee Grant, the film is
based on the novella by Tillie
Olson.

Tell Me... concerns the life
of Eva, an older woman living
alone with her aging husband
who wants to sell their home
which he can no longer keep
up and move to a “retirement
home” where they can live with
other old couples. He has friends
there and likes to socialize; she
wants to be alone with her
music, her books, and her
memories.

When Eva is invaded by
cancer, her husband and children
decide not to tell her the diagno-
sis. Her husband takes her on a
cross-country trip to visit all the
relatives; at home her house is
being sold and she is not told.

Eva is a Jewish woman who
immigrated from Prussia during
the time of the pogroms.
Through flashbacks and intimate
close-ups of her treasured scrap-
book we can witness her early
life of intense country beauty
and an especially close friend-
ship with another young woman.

We then see the terror and pain
that followed, as soldiers shoot
people in her town, imprison
Eva and her friend, and hang her
friend while she watches.

Eva feels that her home is
her one safe space in the world.
As she grows sicker with the
cancer she longs for her home
and eventually her fear and
suspicion that it is sold is con-
firmed by her husband who
realizes just what a terrible but
reversible mistake it was.

Eva's last days are spent in
San Francisco where she and her
husband stay with a sensitive and
loving granddaughter who wants to
know her Jewish culture, who listens to

Lesbian Lyrics
Michiyo Cornell

Reviewed by Peggy Luhrs

If the forces ranged against her had had their way, Michiyo
Cornell would be silent and invisible. She is not. Instead she has
made sense of her experience and chosen to speak both as an
activist and a poet, using these roles to work against the forces
that would destroy her and others of her race, sex, sexual orientation. Lesbian Lyrics is her self-published first volume of poems.
Its publication is cause for celebration as testimony of a survivor
and for the sharing of lesbian experience.

These are clear, angry words about racism, rape, incest. These
are subjects meant to be silenced or only spoken of by psycho-
logists in predigested theoretical words. Michiyo's words are a
sword cutting through the camouflage and speaking directly of
the raw experience. There is no language wasted here, no decora-
tion; a Japanese aesthetic of simplicity prevails. She has survived
being Japanese-American, being a woman, a lesbian, and the
poems tell of what she has endured. She is a survivor because she
speaks, yet even in the speaking there is fear:

I frighten myself

with my words

if I speak too clearly

I know myself open to death.

Women should be silent, lesbians should be invisible, Asian les-
bian women doubly so. The fear in these words is not paranoia
but a recognition of, as Adrienne Rich says, “the forces ranged
against us.” In the same poem she recognizes that “I am a woman
there cannot be as much depth and tragedy to my life... as there
can be for a suave boy who translates a poem from French.”

In “Vow” she wonders about white women:

my father tried to rape me.

it’s that intimate.

sexism/racism.

it’s that intimate.

And knowing how intimate betrayal can be, she warns white
women to beware of betraying her again.

There is love here as well for her daughter, her mother, other
women, and herself. In the poem “Mother,” after naming such of
the pain both she and her mother have known, she wonders if
her mother would have beaten her for being a lesbian and affirms
why she is:

I said I fell in love

With a woman

And that woman

Is myself mother, mostly myself.

In “No Wildfire” she speaks of making love with another
third world woman, testing herself for self-hatred:

And it wasn’t there

We loved each other

As lesbians do

With warmth and gentleness

Companions to each other's solitude.

I found these poems strong and moving. I am glad Michiyo
had the perseverance to publish herself and I hope other women
will read them. Available at Bookstacks and by mail ($3 prepaid)

By Lynn Vera

I've been thinking about
passion lately—the power and
enthusiasm in things that are
alive with it. In talking honestly
and excitedly, in playing in the
woods in fall, and seeing, hearing
and smelling the life and colors
there, or in reading something
written from a true gut vulnerable
place, I am moved by the
passion dared. These times are
frightening and not supportive
of life or difference; I need more
than ever to feel alive and that
we truly are resisting the white
washed, male, money-driven,
military death culture.

These thoughts stirred in me
as I looked at the walls of
photos at the Women Photog-
raphers show at Everywoman’s
Place. Are there things that
make us different as photo-
graphers because we are women?
Or is that expectation just
another part of the myth that
women, or feminist women, are
alike and have the same values, a
myth that keeps us painfully
unaware and dangerously un-
supportive of who each other
really is?

I had a great liking for many of the images in the show,
especially Denise Rose’s “Statue NYC” of an old woman feeding
and watching pigeons, Joan Knight's sensuous series “Paj” (one of the few images of black women), Rachel Atkin’s photos
of native women and dykes in Mexico, and Diane Edgecomb’s
powerful photo “Differently Abled.” I didn’t like the bizarre
piece by Elizabeth Gozzi that had naked men with women's
breasts glued on, and naked women with penises attached, all
pieced together in a large playful beach party, with a surreal neon
condo above. Perhaps it’s "good" in some avant-garde art
context, but I found it offensive to look at.

I tried to decide what made
me like the photos or not.
Questions about the importance
of technical quality vs. subject
matter got me talking. It is true that a photo
with clarity, focus, and good
contrast is attractive and pleas-
ing to look at, and as a some-
times struggling photographer I
know how hard those skills are
to learn. I also know that that is
what “counts” when you're
trying to “Make It” as a photo-
grapher in the world out there.
But if that is the primary con-
sideration of good women’s
photography, it would exclude
the photos of women who don't
have access to the expensive
equipment and training and
practice that those quality
standards demand. I found my-
self heavily leaning toward some
larger appreciation of content
and subject; photos that were
technically very good but didn’t
speak to me of my life and work
as a woman were less drawing
than photos I could personally
celebrate and relate to, often
regardless of “quality.” I kept
thinking about that concept of
passion, that need to have
whatever it is, in this case the
photos, speak with uncensored
defiant celebration.

In her introduction to Eye
To Eye/Portraits of Lesbians (By
JEB), Judith Schwartz details a
history of women in photo-
graphy. She writes that women
have used photography to “com-
municate their creative vision,
support themselves financially,
and record their world and their
lives—though their lives have
been (and continue to be)
consistently ignored, devalued
and distorted.” It was a defiant
act for women to photograph
women in the 1800s; it remains
defiant even today for in 1981
the reality of many of our lives
remains invisible, or at best,
distorted. We need to make
ourselves, each other, visible, to
refuse the mass media images of
who women are and push past
our own often limited images of
who women are, and who
lesbian women are.

As a lesbian woman who
takes photographs, I have gone
to document our lives and work
at home, with each other, in
demonstrations, in the streets
and in Washington, playing,
working, mothering, helping
each other grow, and die... lots
of us, being. We live our lives
without accessible, encouraging
images of women, much less of
lesbians. Martha Courtot writes,
as a large woman and a lesbian
woman, about the “poisonous
invisibility” of being blanked
out by the media:

if one day you woke up and
found that you had been
obliterated from all public
images would you pinch
yourself to see if you
were real?

If women don't make it a
priority to celebrate ourselves,
make ourselves (all of us)
visible, create and portray our
realities of who we are, then it
won't happen. As soon as we
recognize that we have choices,
to whatever small degree that is
restricted, women become a
threat to the status quo. We
need to explore and name these
choices, to claim our own true
identities and then make these
identities visible.

Our perceptions, as JEB
talks about in the first issue of
The Blatant Image (a magazine
of feminist photography), are
affected by race, class, age,
regional and other differences
(like body size), and we need to
acknowledge—and appreciate
these differences. Most of the
women in this show are primar-
ily from privileged backgrounds
or current lives. Class has a lot to
do with who photographers are;
photography is expensive. I'm
not so sure how class back-
ground is reflected in subject
matter; it’s a bit more subtle
than the ableism, looks and size
isms and racism. But thinking
about it all makes me think
more and more about visibility—
who and what we photograph.
None of us can be invisible if all
of us are to survive. We need
to think about making visible
that which the mainstream
