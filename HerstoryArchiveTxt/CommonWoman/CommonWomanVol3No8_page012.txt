‘On Being  
Political  

By Gwen Shervington  

Little Girl, sit down and let  
me tell you a story. A story  
about a utopia, a women's haven  
hidden amongst the beautiful  
green mountains of Vermont.  
Women struggling against a  
male supremacist society, trying  
to survive, reestablishing a cul-  
ture not based on the hierarchical  
male criterion.  

They need and use each  
other’s support for better or  
worse, usually for worse because  
true support can only come  
from the Goddess within. Speak-  
ing a common language yet not  
hearing, saying, or doing the  
same thing, and not practicing  
what is being preached, does not  
constitute community. A lesbian  
community could be a culture  
based on true love due to  
sisterhood and not one based on  
political values. Oppression is  
based on the premise that an  
individual cannot express her  
individuality outside or differ-  
ently from the standard societal  
model. And this women's haven  
hidden amongst the beautiful  
green mountains of Vermont  
exercises oppression too... oppression  
of the mind!  

Hence, anyone not into  
downward mobility is politically  
incorrect. Little Girl, don’t you  
go to college (although most of  
them have), if you have any  
money you'd better give it away

a smile, is the white male capital-  
ist — whose pockets we're  
filling!  

But alas, it’s Christmas Eve  
and the alleys, skies fill up with  

the sounds of carollers. Each  
singing in their own native  
tongue...  

Merry Christmas — Feliz  
Navidad — Krismas — Singdaan-  
faaiohk — Kurisumasu — Hari  
Natal — to name a few.  

..all singing together. All singing  
alone. :  

But what is this I hear about -  
banning Christmas. This all-out  
campaign to wipe Christmas off  
the calendar???  

My Christmas. My ritual. A  
time of the year when my  
relatives, friends, family circles  
come together to celebrate  
another year. Another death.  
Another birth. Sharing food,  
customs, music and just plain  
visiting.  

Yet, as the family moves  
apart, it gets harder for us to  
meet, and share in the laughter.  
Some make new families passing  
traditions on to their children.  
Though, as a Third World Lesbian,  
finding myself independent of  
the instant family kit, (That  
reads mix one female & one  
male in jar, let sit. Watch it  
grow) sees the “family” as not  
that easily made, making our  
traditions, rituals, & customs,  
that must be kept alive by us.  

and most importantly you must  
deal with your isms, particularly  
racism; just give the Third World  
women $900 and all will be  
fine!  

What positive things have  
they done, you ask? Well, they  
gave what they call support to  
the 6 women arrested in July  
(except to those not community  
based who had trials during the  
Michigan festival), there’s a  
community childcare system  
which lets a woman delegate  
some of her motherhood respon-  
sibilities to the community (hea-  
ven help her if she wants to take  
some of that responsibility  
back), and currently they are  
seeking to establish a women's  
center (or more specifically, a  
center for politically correct  

Christianity, a religious  
philosophy, that is practiced  
here and in other countries.  

Third World countries, by Third  
World people. Rituals of a  
multitude, that have come  
through the ages, passed on for  
centuries. Centuries of burnings,  
of the lives of people that have  
been raped, ripped-off of self-  
identities. That along with this  
campaign we once again see the  
denied visibility of our sisters.  
Yet, our invisibility will not  
threaten us. Our rituals, tradi-  
tions, customs, will stay alive.  
Lighting candles and letting  
them burn, remembering our  
sisters that have come before  
and will come again.  

“...And giving a nod, up the  
chimney he rose. He sprang in  
his sleigh, to his team gave a  
whistle, and away they all flew  
like the down of a thistle; But I  
heard him exclaim, ere he drove  
out of sight:  

“Happy Christmas to all,  
and to all a good-night!”  

(radical non-black lesbians).  

So you see Little Girl, if  
you want to belong, if you want  
to fit into this community, there  
are certain things you must do,  
simply being a lesbian does not  
insure immediate membership.  
First, get used to pretending  
you're poor. It’s okay to own a  
car and a house and spend the  
summer in Mexico if the mood  
hits you, but on the day to day  
level you must emit a sense of  
struggle. Never question the fact  
that you are struggling by  
choice and not necessity!  
Secondly, be willing to accept  
support even if you don’t want  
it and consequently you must be  
able to force your support  
on others. A woman who is able  
to sufficiently deal with life by

Review’s  
Alix Dobkin’s New Sound  

What happens when Alix  
Dobkin gets together with  
Susann P. Shanbaum (of The  
Berkeley Women’s Music Collec-  
tive) and a roster of topflight  
women musicians — including  
Renee Purnell, River Light-  
woman, J. T. Thomas, Helen  
Hooke (of The Deadly Night-  
shade) and Lise Brown, in a  

studio with Marilyn Ries at the  
16-track board? It's called  

XXALIX and you've never heard  
anything like it!  
Susann P's arrangements are  

herself and make decisions with  
minimal outside influence is  
stupid; why be absolutely  
responsible for your life when  
there are 30-40 women willing  
to help you make the right  
choices? Lastly and most impor-  
tantly, you must strive to  
become as political and radical  
as possible, even if no one can  
tell you what being political or  
radical means. Think as the  
community does, be as the  
community is and you will have  
no problem finding acceptance.  

So you go on out there  
Little Girl and become a Poli-  
dyke, but remember, politics  
and karate classes don’t mix!

tight, engaging and thrilling. The  
performances are first rate. Pop,  
country, folk, music-hall and  
rock styles highlight Alix’s deep-  
ly personal and highly political  
material. Within their sophistica-  
ted musical settings, lover, ex-  
lover, mother-daughter, inter-  
community, — individual-society  
and female-male relationships  
are explored with characteristic  
Lesbian vision and commentary.  
The songs include: ‘Denny's  
Tune,” “Separation ‘78,” “A  
Mother Knows,” “Living with  
Contradictions,” “Theme From  
‘Getting Ready’,” and ‘Just
