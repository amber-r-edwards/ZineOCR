Commonwoman,  

Inc., is a not-for-profit corporation founded for  

the purpose of publishing Commonwoman, a Vermont women’s publication  
of news, culture and dialogue from a feminist perspective. Commonwoman, Inc.,  

is made up of a small group of women who work together  

collectively to put out this paper. At present, no one on the collective is  

paid for her work.  

We will consider for publication articles, poems, short stories, letters,  
cartoons, graphics and photographs submitted by women. All articles  
should be typed and double-spaced; we prefer articles that are no longer  
than three pages. We reserve the right to edit for length and clarity.  

Signed articles reflect the viewpoint of the author and not necessarily  

that of the collective.  

the contributor.  

A Note on Procedure: We hold an editorial committee meeting on the  
date of our first deadline (printed in this box) and decide by consensus  
which of the copy we have received will be published in our next issue; this  
copy is sent to the typesetter. The following Sunday, the editorial commit-  

tee meets again for its final deadline meeting; this deadline is intended for  

late-breaking news and this is the last time the committee can consider  

copy for publication in the next issue. This copy is also sent to the type-  
setter; the last of the typesetting for each issue is done the Friday before  
publication. The paper is laid out the weekend before publication and is  

delivered to  

six weeks:  

Send all contributions for the next issue of Commonwoman to P.O.  
Box 242, Winooski, Vt. 05404 before the deadline printed in this box.  

Subscription Rates: $6.00/8 issues for individuals; $20.00/8 issues for  
institutions. Free on request to women in prison and women in mental  

institutions.  

Commonwoman, Inc.  

P.O. Box 242  

Winooski, Vt. 05404  
Typesetting: Sue Ball  
Deadline January 6, 1981  

This newspaper needs to sell  
a lot of subscriptions and get  
donations in order to keep  
publishing. We realized recently  
that we're in serious financial  
trouble. Only one issue of  
Commonwoman has paid for  
itself in the last year (approxi-  
mately). This is partly because,  
as we've gotten more outspoken  
on some issues, it’s been harder  
to sell ads. We've had to borrow  
money to put this issue out, and  
that’s no way to run a paper. We  

don’t know if Commonwoman  
has a future.  

Also, we still need new  
woman energy. The same few  
people do most of the work.  
There are tasks that could be  
taken on by people without  
requiring much time or trouble,  
which would help us a lot. Call  
Dian Kendrick Mueller  
658-0146 for more information,  
as well as for the location of the  
December 16 editorial commit-  
tee meeting.  

ATROCITIES  

Dear Euan,  

What you have been doing  
in Atrocities is very important to  
me. It has filled the need I  
express in the enclosed poem,  
which is about my little sister  
who died seven years ago.  

I’m not where I can help  
you do it, but I hope someone  
will.  

Nora F. Kerr  

POET  

Dear Commonwoman,  

Acknowledging that so  
much of your prose and poetry  
are, and I feel should be, direct  
political statements, I send you  
these poems and want to encour-  
age you to publish them. Les-  
bian sex is political; poems are  
public statements. And, I ask  
you, where else can an aspiring  
lesbian poet send her stuff?  

I hope you print these, but  
mostly I hope you answer,  

Sue Schein

WAY  

INCEST  

Dear Commonwoman,  

I am a 20-year-old Lesbian.  
I have lived here in Burlington  
for a year. I came from the  
Northeast Kingdom of Vermont.  
I would like to share my anger  
and heartache that I have had  
for so many years. At the age of  
eight I lost my eighteen-year-old  
brother in a car accident. My  
parents had seven boys and three  
girls. He was a great guy. When  
he died, a lot of things began to  
happen. Two years later my  
mother had a nervous break-  
down and cancer. So for a year  
I lived with the fear of losing my  
mother. At the age of fourteen  
I was raped by my brother. From  
then on I had so much hate  
inside myself that I even hated  
myself for letting it happen to  
me. The next day I told my  
sister-in-law that I was raped.  
She told me not to tell anyone,  
especially Mother. So for two  
years I lived with the pain and  
feeling dirty about myself.  
Throughout the two years I  
drank a lot and popped pills. I  
wanted to die but a part of me  
wanted to live.  

So, one day I trusted a  
social studies teacher in high  
school and told her that I tried  
to kill myself and why. She told  

Dear Commonwoman,  

The idea of woman space,  
particularly Wimmin's Land  
Space, is not a new one. Various  
women, in groups and alone,  
have struggled for years to have  
control and access to a land  
space that is Woman space.  

Early this year a few women  
in Kentucky began meeting  
to discuss the possibilities/  
visions of a woman’s land space  
in Kentucky. With each meeting  
our goals/dreams/visions grew  
and spiraled. On September 15,  
1980 we incorporated as Spiral  
Wimmin’s Land Cooperative,  
Inc. Our purposes are to acquire  
land, to hold title not as public  
or private property but in  
trusteeship; to preserve and hold  
the land in stewardship for  
future generations of women.  
To provide a space for women  
to develop vocational training  
and education of alternative  
skills and survival methods. To  
help set up a network of women  
throughout the country that  
would promote Lesbianism and  
feminism, and challenge sexism,  
racism, ageism, capitalism and  
institutionalized heterosexism in  
the society; to support the basic  
tenets of feminism: defined as a  
doctrine that advocates for women  
social, economic, spiritual  
and political freedom to deter-  
mine their own lives; to encour-  
age and support women to free  
ourselves from a traditionally  
oppressive system; to share our  
skills, knowledge and resources  
to help bring about the re-birth  
of women’s culture. To provide  
space, shelter, re-creation and  
refuge for women. To promote  

me that I needed help and asked  
me to see a social worker at  
Mental Health. I went and saw  
her and I finally told my  
parents, but I was blamed for it  
and I asked to be put in a foster  
home. So that all added to the  
pain and anger inside me. It  
continued to build up inside. My  
family didn’t want anything to  
do with me until I acted right.  
So I didn’t know what that  
meant to them. After six months  
the family started to treat me  
better. Then in 1979 I found out  
that my niece was being molested  
by two members of my  
family. I got very upset and  
reported it to my social worker.  
My niece was taken away only  
for three months. The men got  
away with it and she is now back  
home. I have a right to be angry  
because you know who paid  
for their mistakes of incest. I did  
and my niece. The family told  
me that I was sick, for what? for  
telling the truth. My brothers  
and sisters don’t want anything  
to do with me because of what  
I did to the family. So we all  
know who pays for their mis-  
takes. I am glad to be a Lesbian.  
My love is for women.  
A proud Lesbian  
M.C.  

spiritual, physical and cultural  
well-being of women based on  
truth, honesty, love and support;  
and to support awareness of  
each woman as an individual  
with unique potential.  

As of October 1980 a land  
space has not yet been pur-  
chased. We are looking at an  
acreage of 100-250 acres in  
Wayne County, Kentucky that  
we are considering. There is  
much work to be done to make  
a purchase of land space possi-  
ble. Right now our group is  
small, 5-7 women actively com-  
mitted. If we are to have a  
women’s land space in Ken-  
tucky we need women who are  
dedicated to working toward  
that goal. Women who feel a  
responsibility toward making  
women’s land happen.  

Currently we are focusing  
on fund-raising and membership.  
Membership is open to indivi-  
dual women only. Annual mem-  
bership is based on a sliding scale  

$3.00 per $1,000 of gross  
income. More if you can, less if  
you can't. We need women to  
purchase memberships. We need  
donations. We need women to  
attend general membership  
meetings and to work on com-  
mittees, particularly fund-raising  
and communication.  

To make donation(s) and/or  
membership fees, make check or  
money order payable to: Spiral  

Wimmin’s Land Cooperative,  
Inc., P.O. Box 337, Monticello,  
Kentucky 42633 (606)

NUDITY ~  

Dear Commonwoman,  

I want to use this space to  
reply to Liz about nudity and  
erotica. I do not think that  
nudity or erotica per se devalue  
women or our bodies. We have a  
right to our sexuality and our  
celebration of our sexuality,  
period.  

But there was a more  
serious issue that I wanted to  
raise with Liz which was her idea  
that if we wanted “to bring the  
light” to homophobic people  
that we would have to act in a  
certain manner. Liz, my people,  
Japanese Americans, tried that  
approach and wound up in  
concentration camps during  
World War II; to put it simply, it  
doesn't work. Similarly, the  
Daughters of Bilitus had a  
similar idea to yours and found  
that dress codes, dignified fund-  
raisers (so they could socialize  
without being accused of  
“recruiting”) and the locking  
out of young teenage women did  

not work; they were still  
arrested, harassed, etc. I don’t  
earn respect; either people  

respect me or they don’t. If they  
don’t want to respect me, there  
is nothing I can do or say to  
change that. Only they can make  
that decision.  
Sincerely yours,  
Michiyo  

WRITER  

Commonwoman  

I've been an “outside”  
member of the community for  
some time, but a member  
nonetheless. According to Ms.  
Schneiderman “Commonwoman  
is an all women’s newspaper  
which is read and written by  
heterosexual and lesbian women.  
The paper is a vehicle for sharing  
ideas and thoughts in a more  
public way... it gives the com-  
munity a chance to share issues  
of concern with a greater num-  
ber of women and creates a  
forum for dialogue.” (Vanguard,  
Nov. 4, 1980, p. 22) This is my  
attempt to share my ideas and  
thoughts on Ms. Schneiderman’s  
article and on the community in  
general.  

I am a writer, not an aspiring  
one! I do not want my  
article changed in any shape or  
form, except of course in the  
layout, if the need be. I have  
proofread my work and I am  
completely satisfied with the  
outcome, both grammatically  
and in content. TAKE NOTE:  
I USE THE TERM “non-black”  
ON THE TOP OF THE  
SECOND PAGE, THIS IS NOT  
A SPELLING ERROR!! I’ve  
used this spelling for my own  
(and my sisters) political rea-  
sons, PLEASE DO NOT ADD  
THE “c”; I'll be happy to give  
an explanation to anyone inter-  
ested...  

Sincerely,  
Ms. Gwendolyn Shervington
