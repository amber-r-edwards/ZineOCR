In the second part of the
book the women generally show
how feminism and nonviolence
apply to specific areas of strug-
gle: tax resistance, anti-war and
anti-nuke work, self-defense,
animal rights, personal relation-
ships.

Some of the women contri-
buting to this anthology are
Barbara Deming, Donna War-
nock, Sally Gearheart, Holly
Near, Grace Paley, Juanita Nel-
son, Lea Fritz, Joan Baez, to
name a few.

At the back of the antho-
logy is an appendix of significant
statements, letters, and docu-
ments written by women com-
mitted to nonviolently resisting
various forms of oppression.
Also at the back is an annotated
bibliography of works appro-
priate for exploring the subjects
of feminist nonviolence and the
tradition of women as peace-
makers and life-enhancers and
sustainers.

The problem with living in a patriarchal society, in a

Lesbians Changing

racist society, in a sexist society, is that it really traps us into
dealing, into coping, and into saying that those are the only
battles — but it’s not true. The minute we buy that, we’re lost.
Because none of us lives for 300 years, and no matter how tri-
umphant we are in our particular lives, that particular life is going
to be over. 

Audre Lorde

“I myself have never
been able to find out
precisely what feminism is: I only know that people call me a
feminist whenever I express sentiments that differentiate me from a
doormat or a prostitute." 

“You have 3 great peaceniks in the country: Weinberger, Haig,
and Reagan. Every time they open their mouths, the peace move-
ment is set back.”

writer and early 20th
century suffragist
