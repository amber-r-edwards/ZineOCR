I rebelled and yet

Here I am today no longer afraid

of loving you or losing myself

I cry for all the years I couldn't understand

I cry for all the years I couldn't freely love you
you who needed so much love and compassion
to counteract the hunger and self-hate
Somehow I've learned to welcome

your tears and your stories

Today I sing praises to your strength

your courage and your wit

How did you survive?

Was it chance? Was it a miracle?

For one year, in spite of hunger beyond imagination,
you refused to eat the soup that would have made you sterile.
My very existence is a miracle.

How did you survive?

I grope for answers to this elusive question

But without knowing the answer, this I do know—

that you have given me whatever it is that you had

that if it were to happen to me, and if I were favored by chance
I too would survive

By a twist of fate, music saved you

back there in Auschwitz

Is it a coincidence

that through music we have spoken when there was no other
way?

I am so much your daughter

Henia Flint Gottlieb Goodman

Our lifestyles are different, but our essence is the same
I celebrate how much I am like you

your strength is my strength

your music is my music

I am of your flesh

and I am independent

Today I find myself living out the life you would have led
But it is my life too

I choose it freely

And is it a coincidence
That today I am twenty-seven years old
and I play Chopin?

—Dovida ishatova

The wisdom and understanding I have gained from both fem-
inism and lesbianism about my relationships with women has
dramatically changed my relationship with my mother. As
pianists, we are now performing From Mother to Daughter and
Back Again together across the country. The following excerpt
from the program reflects my journey to where I am today:
