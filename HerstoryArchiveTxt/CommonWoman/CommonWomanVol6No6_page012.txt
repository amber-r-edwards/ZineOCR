1/17/82 — For Ellen

“Don’t go away
Please don’t hide”

“But I have to
I have to
To protect myself”

From what?

From him, from pain

But it still hurts

I am hurting myself keeping these
poisonous feelings inside

“It's ok,” she said, “Show me.
Tell me. Scream at me.
I love you, don't keep it inside”

I am punishing you by staying away
But I am punishing myself as well

Why do I slip into self
Torture so easily...

It is like a rut in the gullies of my
Mind

Years

Years and lifetimes

Of Self-Torture

Poisoning ourselves with guilt
Stuffing, suffocating
Ourselves

With our anger, our hurt

Get it out. Put it where it belongs
Scream it, nurse it, own it

Get rid of it if you can’t use it:

Or embrace your anger, sharpen it, hone it
Strengthen it in the fires of your soul
Like fine steel
Begin to peel away the layers
Slice through passivity

—Amethyst Spirit-Dancer

Mutual Pact

I'm so selfish,

My love,

I'm still alive:

I remember you

The vow we took together
That we would never marry
Or — if forced to marry —

We would die.

Our mothers knew of our love
And permitted it:

The Lost Artist a
RY
yw
It is my hands, AQ
My cracked bleeding hands

That betray me.
I wanted to paint
But no man
Would take me
As an apprentice.
I was married,
Had eight children:
Lost one by miscarriage
And three by sickness.
I sketched as I could:
Pictures of my children,
Everyday scenes
In a few hours snatched
From daily chores.
My husband, a fisherman by trade,
Died and I went to work
In a silk factory.
My children helped
But I had no strength
To sketch after work.
My hands cracked, bled
From the scalding water
We used to loosen
The threads of the cocoon
So we can wind the thread
On reels.
My hands cracked and bleeding,
Gnarled with arthritis.
I can no longer
Hold a brush,

—Michiyo Cornell 1977

For an Unborn Child

ghost that I am crawling beneath
your night bed, waving soul’s fragrance
into nostrils, your spine flexing

after
o shee

In

A brief joy before lifelong bondage.
I wept when I saw your dead body
With your head grotesquely askew.
I could not die

And so I married.

He raped me, my love;

I am heavy with his child.

If a girl,

She will be born

To slavery like mine.

If a boy, .

He will be a man

Like any other.

There is no way out

Except madness or death.

“My love,
I drink this poison for you

And the life we could not have together.
—Michiyo Cornell 1977

like ripened wheat.
easily, I chain morning sun into
triangular sections of your hips.

like fields hurried and wild

I will be the day resting upon
cheeks, the colony of blood
flowing from your mouth.
now we come to one another,
leaping over sun’s yellow arms.

how can we pull one another through
this birth and sun’s fertility?
small throbs trail down your newly
formed legs where I've yet to touch.
child hidden beneath my winter coat,
I kiss you.
