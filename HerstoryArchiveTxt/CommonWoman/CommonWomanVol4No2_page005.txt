COMMONWOMAN MARCH/APRIL, 1981

Resistance

— Feminists

West Rutland
call them anti-women, but
townspeople seem unruffled by
wet T-shirt contests staged at the
Rustic Woodshed bar. While six
placard-waving women protested
what they felt was “sex-ploitation,” three young women

garbed in T-shirts and shorts
were getting water doused on
them as a sea of patrons gawked
at the spectacle. The state
Liquor Board lifted the bar’s
license last fall after two women
slid their sopping shirts off at a
contest.

Update on Mohawks

By Michiyo Cornell

Events at Raquette Point
have clarified since the armed
confrontation between the Tra-
ditionalists and the New York
state police. Governor Hugh
Carey has tried to make it
appear that the state police were
acting as a neutral peace force
between two warring factions of
the Saint Regis Mohawks but
even a local paper, the Post-
Standard, says that “Mohawk
‘Stand-Off’ Appeared Planned.”
Bob Strom, who wrote the news
analysis on June 16, 1980, noted
that the “state police made no
move Friday or Saturday to
disarm any of the tribal Indians”
or to stop them from setting up
skirmish lines and sighting their
guns on the Traditionalist
encampment.

The events leading up to the
confrontation between the
Mohawk vigilantes and the Tra-
ditionalists go back to 1948
when the Mohawks voted not to
accept “the elective system
imposed on them” by the state
of New York. Two years later —
in 1950 — the state of New York
sent state police in and forced
the Mohawks to accept “the
elective system.”

To this day, the Mohawks
do not have a constitution or set
of laws to govern them on the
reservation. The only thing they
officially have is the system set
up by the state of New York.
According to the Indian Law
Resource Center, the Tribal
Council has no system of laws,
no constitution, no courts, no
police practices or review board.

Yet the Tribal Council has
an Akwesasne police force which
has LEAA and CETA funding as
well as some officers who have
been trained by the state police
of New York. One of the grants
written up by the Tribal Council
said that the police were to
function by “maintaining order
and facilitating negotiations
between the Traditionalists and
the Tribal Council.” Yet the
police have been described by
Ms. Beverly Boots, a Tradi-
tionalist, as a “tribal goon
squad” which is used by the
Tribal Council to suppress dissent.

Events lend credence to Ms.
Boots’ words. The question of
the legality of the Mohawk
police force surfaced when Pat-
rolman Patricia Ransom alleged-
ly poured beer on Traditionalist
Mary Francis; Ms. Ransom also
allegedly pulled Ms. Francis’ hair
and threatened her with a
gun. (The state of New York
does not have “patrolwomen” or
“patrolpeople,” only “patrol-
men,” even when they are
women.) According to Akwe-

sasne Notes (Winter, 1980), the
Traditionalist paper, some pat-
rolmen harassed and fired at
Traditionalists after having a
fight with them at Tatlocks, a
local bar on December 27. Yet
another patrolman, William
Sears, was arrested for firing 50
rounds of ammunition into the
Traditionalist encampment. The
sore point of these events, aside
from the assaults on Tradition-
alists, is whether or not the
Mohawk police should be carry-
ing firearms off the reservation
and using them to harass Tradi-
tionalists.

From what information I have,
it's clear that the events at
Raquette Point stem from an
internal conflict over the legality
of the Tribal Council at St. Regis
and its use of a state and federal
funded police force. The state of
New York in the person of
Governor Carey has shown that
it supports the Tribal Council
and will act to suppress the
Traditionalists, who wish to
operate by traditional religious
and tribal law. It is a grave
danger indeed when the state of
New York decides to interfere
with intratribal affairs and uses
state police to join forces with
vigilantes in harassing Tradition-
alists who only wish to see the
terms of U.S. federal treaties
with Native Americans honored.
Both the Tribal Council and the
state of New York blame Tradi-
tionalists for the intratribal
violence and confrontations that
have taken place, but events
show the blame should go the
other way.

Pro-Life?

Washington, D.C. — Thou-
sands of anti-abortion demon-
strators marched in the capitol
recently and heard Health and
Human Services Secretary
Richard S. Schweiker promise
“to implement a pro-life policy”
in his department. At the same
time, March for Life leaders’
efforts were being denounced by
the National Abortion Rights
League and the American Civil
Liberties Union. Laura Murphy
of the ACLU announced lobby-
ing efforts in five states:
Vermont, New Hampshire, Mon-
tana, Wyoming and North Dako-
ta against the proposed
constitutional amendment.

Goodbye,
Ella

By Lee Douglas

I feel it appropriate to
comment in this issue on the
passing of one of the most
prominent, and most loved,
political figures of our era,
Governor Ella Grasso of Con-
necticut. Ella’s career was
without parallel in American
politics. She, herself, embodied
many of the characteristics so
many of us are striving for. She
could be tough when necessary,
yet truly cared about the people.
She was compassionate and sensitive
to the needs of others. She
left behind a legacy of trust,
respect and honor. Her’s will
be a tough act to follow. Ella
will be truly missed by all of
us concerned with the quality
of life. We've lost a real
leader.

Castrate
Rapists?

Memphis, Tenn. — Police
Director E. Winslow Chapman,
whose city had the nation’s
highest rape rate last year, thinks
rapists should be castrated. “The
possible consequence of castra-
tion would dissuade 90 to 95%
of rapists,” Chapman said. “If
maybe we can castrate rapists
one or two times... that crime
would go down the drain. I’m
convinced of that.” Chapman
said he received a number of
phone calls after his comments
appeared in a local newspaper
and he said reaction was “almost
totally positive.” But the police
director said he doubted his
suggestions would win wide
support.

Gay Issues

Lesbian Regains Children

Greenfield, Mass. An
avowed lesbian won her court
battle to regain custody of the
two daughters she voluntarily
surrendered to the care of a
friend five years ago. The state’s
highest court overturned a lower
court decision that concluded
that Ms. Brenda King’s lesbian-
ism “creates an element of
instability that would adversely
affect the welfare of the child-
ren.” The high court ruled that
Ms. King’s sexual preference was
“irrelevant” to her ability to
raise her children and ordered a
new custody hearing.

Bill for Gays

Washington, D.C. — A bill
to prohibit discrimination on the
basis of sexual orientation was
introduced into the House of
Representatives with an addi-
tional 37 co-sponsors. This bill
was originally introduced into
the 96th Congress, but no action
was taken so it was re-intro-
duced into the 97th Congress. It
is expected that hearings will be
held before the Employment
Opportunity Committee and the
Constitutional and Civil Rights
Committee this year.

The Environment

North Conway, N.H. — A
Georgia company announced a
proposal recently to obtain
government financing and build
a commercial geothermal electric
power plant in New Hampshire.
The project would produce
enough energy to power
130,000 houses and heat 30
acres of greenhouses, company
officials said. New Hampshire
was chosen because the Conway
Granite underlying the White
Mountains is geologically stable
and produces the highest tem-
peratures at the shallowest
depths. The New Hampshire site
is also an attractive market
because New England depends
on expensive imported oil for its
electrical power.

Health

Montpelier, Vt. The
House Health and Welfare Com-
mittee has voted unanimous
approval of a bill that would
allow marijuana to be used to
treat cancer and glaucoma
patients. Under the bill, mari-
juana could be prescribed for
patients who do not respond to
conventional drugs, or for those
who suffer severe side effects
from other drugs. Several doc-
tors testified in favor of the
measure, saying marijuana has
been effective in combating
nausea caused by chemotherapy
and in easing glaucoma symp-
toms. The bill now goes to the
full House.

“Sodom and Gomorrah”

San Francisco, Ca. — Calling
San Francisco the “Sodom and
Gomorrah" of the nation, a
coalition of fundamentalist
groups says it will spend $3
million on a media campaign
attacking homosexuals. The coa-
lition said it will buy adver-
tisements to build anti-gay feel-
ing in the community and
attempt to persuade homo-
sexuals to give up their lifestyles.
Homosexuals in San Francisco
have complained recently of an
increase in violence against
them, including beatings by
people gay activists refer to as
“homophobics” and some ex-
pressed concern that the planned
crusade will heighten tensions.

ERA

Miami Beach, Fla. — The
Miami Beach City Commission,
hoping to circumvent a feminist
boycott of this tourist and
convention-dependent resort,
adopted a “little Equal Rights
Amendment.” The commission
voted 7-0 for a city law guaran-
teeing equality of the sexes,
after approving an amendment
exempting “moral and religious
activities.”

Solidarity

Montpelier, Vt. — About 35
activists from a variety of
movements have decided to go
ahead with a proposal to have a
“solidarity conference” this
spring or early summer. The
general purpose of the confer-
ence would be to stimulate
cooperation among single-issue
groups — anti-nuclear, organized
labor, food cooperative, anti-
draft, anti-war, child care,
women’s, civil liberties and left-
ist political. Some of the organi-
zers of the conference are Terry
Bouricius (peace movement,
Liberty Union and Citizens
Party), Doreen Kraft (involved
in several movements and now
on a team making a movie about
the Nicaraguan literacy cam-
paign), and Gene Bergman (a
director of PACT working on
rent control for Burlington). The
consensus of opinion among
these parties is that the Reagan
administration will be hostile to
the Left and activists in general.
