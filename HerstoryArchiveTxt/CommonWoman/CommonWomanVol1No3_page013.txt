Oct. 1978

Commonwoman

It’s made possible through a  
U.S. government sponsored  
program called the Farmers  
Home Administration (FmHA),  
whose office is located in the  

Essex Junction Post Office  
building. Yes, it’s true! No  
money needed for a  

down payment on your house  
loan if your income is below  
$10,000 a year.  

This fantastic program is  
designed to help low income  
people own their homes through  
a subsidized low interest 33-year  
loan. Imagine owning  
eight-and-a-half acres of land and  
a three-bedroom ranch (brand  

new!) within commuting  
distance of Burlington, and  
paying a monthly mortgage  

payment (at 1% interest) of less  
than $120! This is what we now  
own, and what is also possible  
for you.  

Our adventure into house  
buying began in a real estate  
office late one Saturday morning  
in March, 1978. The woman  
realtor we met that morning was  
understanding and told us about  
FmHA, though admitting  
honestly that most realtors avoid  
mentioning this program because  
of increased paperwork and  
possible delays getting their  
money. She also told us that  
“it's the only way young,  
low-income people can own a  
house today” and that she knew  
many people who had gotten a  
loan through FmHA at 1%  
interest and no down payment.  

We couldn’t wait to attend  
the next meeting, held on  
Monday afternoon in Essex,  
though we tried not to get our  
hopes up too high in case things  
didn’t work out. We felt that the  
chances of two single women,  
low income at that, were pretty  
slim. We were troubled by the  
dilemma of “credit ratings.”  
With only one of us working full  
time, what were the chances  

with the “system”? There were  
so many negative sides that we  
nearly bagged the idea entirely.  
But something drove us on —  
although we prepared to be  
rejected. Everyone else had said  
“no,” why not FmHA?  

At the meeting we learned a  
lot more about the program:  
what we could buy with the  
loan, how to adjust our income,  

how to estimate personal  
interest and mortgage payments.  
Then came the hard part.  

Looking for a house with five or  
more acres of land (pasture at  
that) within our loan range  
($35,000). You see, we have  
three horses, four goats, 11  

chickens, four dogs and one cat.  

Our dream was to start a  
homestead in the privacy and  
quiet of the country, somewhere  
within commuting distance of  
Burlington. Unfortunately,  
everyone in the Burlington area  
is doing the same thing.  

We looked at several junk  

houses and decided to look at  
land to build on instead. This  
was also difficult to find in our  
price range because of the  
inflation of land prices. Over  
$1000 an acre in the Burlington  
area and building lots are more!  
It was becoming more and more  
discouraging all the time, but we  
kept looking and hoping. You  
have to realize that anything  
reasonably priced, that is nice,  
will be grabbed up the same day  
it comes on the market because  
the realtors are always watching  
the listings for their best clients  
with the ready cash.  

We had to find five or more  
acres that would pass a “perc  
test” (how fast water is absorbed  
by the soil for your sewage  
system — required by law), was  
open pasture land, priced under  
$10,000, zoned appropriately so  

that FmHA would approve  
purchase, and within commuting  
distance of Burlington.

Dianne Trepanier  

Incidentally, a “perc test,” if not  
already done, can cost a  
prospective buyer around $200!  

We were lucky, because the  
land we found was in Charlotte,  
where the town pays for the  
“perc test” to be done and the  
building permit costs $35, which  
we had to pay. We found this  
parcel of eight-and-a-half acres  
of hay meadow after talking to  
farmers, friends, relatives,  
neighbors, co-workers, and  
making about a hundred phone  
calls to realtors and people  
advertising in the newspapers.  

Our land was just what we  
were looking for — open and  
plenty of room for animals,  
away from the road. We decided  
to compromise on the privacy  
idea, since we would have three  
neighboring houses, but hedges  
would help that also.  

The excitement began as we  
tried desperately to get money  
to deposit on the land to hold it  
for us. We made an offer of  
$7000 and it was accepted! The  
next step was deciding on a  
builder. After a little searching,  
we decided on the Flanders  
“Wonder Home” three-bedroom  

ranch because they make them  
so well insulated now. We had to  
do quite a bit of running around  
to get all estimates finalized for  
FmHA before we could make  
out the application for a loan.  

Next came the hard part —  
waiting for approval. We spent  
many hours making plans and  
drawing diagrams of how we  
would set up the animals, house,  
barn, riding ring, etc. So much  
dreaming and hoping...  

Finally, two weeks later, we  
received letters from Essex  
FmHA that we had been  
determined eligible, and we cried  
with happiness and relief. One  
week later, they called us and  
said that we would have to sign  
more papers so that they could  
send for the money in St. Louis.  
We had been approved!!  
Another two weeks and the  
money was in an account for us  
and we went through “closing”  
on the land. The land was ours  
for the price of closing fees  
(lawyer, town clerk, taxes, etc.  
had to be paid by us) of $350.  
We were so happy!  

The cellar hole for the house  
was dug one week after closing  

and the anticipation mounted  
with each passing day. Things  
went quickly, but we wanted  
them to go faster. We wanted to  
move in right away because, in  
order to keep our animals, we  
had had to rent a broken-down  
trailer and board out our horses  
down the road. We felt as if we  
were camping out at this trailer  
and we were very anxious to  
have the horses with us.  
Unfortunately, we didn’t move  
soon enough. One week before  
we moved into our new house,  
two of our animals — one  
milking goat and our beloved old  
English sheepdog — were killed  
in the road in front of the  
trailer. We were sick with grief.  
With good comes bad.  

We're all moved in now — five  
months after we first began  
looking for our dream. The  
house is beautiful, though it’s  
had its little problems. We are  
still painting, staining and  
planning.  

Our loan was for $37,000  
because we had to drill a well for  
water. Now the maximum has
