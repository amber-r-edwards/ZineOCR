My whole life I have heard  
frightening accounts of anti-  
semitism. As an American, mid-  
dle class Jew, I have been lucky  
to have only experienced more  
subtle examples of this. Recently  
I have begun to feel scared  
and threatened as a Jew in the  
world.  

For three months Israel has  
been militarily aggressive... in  
confronting the Palestinian  
Liberation Organization's  
(P.L.O.) attempts to threaten  
and destroy Israel’s survival and  
existence. Both peoples have  
culture and history attached to  
this tiny piece of Middle East  
land. The original Palestine also  
contained what is known today  
as the East Bank of Jordan. It  
feels anti-semitic to me that the  
world has focused on so much  
anti-Israel media without con-  
fronting Jordan on this similar  
issue. Israel has in the past  
offered the Palestinian people  
the option of a sizeable portion  
of the land for a Palestinian  
State, which they rejected.  

And what of the other Arab  
nations? What responsibility do  
they have or have they taken to  
deal with this sincere problem of  
a homeland for these two  
peoples? What resources, sup-  

port, ideas or options have they  
offered the Palestinian Arabs or  
the Jews to help encourage the  
safe co-existence of both peoples  
in the Middle East? Anti-  
semitism goes back a long time  
in the Arab world. The Arab  
people by far outnumber the  

Jews in the Mideast and could  

potentially use this ugly link of  
anti-semitism to destroy Israel.  

I believe anti-semitism and  
the politics of Arab oil have led  
to a one-sided, power-hungry,  
genocidal, cruel and sadistic  
portrayal of the Israeli and  
P.L.O. war in Lebanon. I do not  
support war as an effective  
means of problem-solving, but it  
is very scary to realize how little  
mention there has been of the  
reasons Israel has chosen to be  
militarily aggressive. I do not  
support Israel’s politics as a  
nation. I do not support most  
nations’ politics including the  
U.S.A. I do not agree with  
Israel’s support of the military  
junta in Guatemala, or with their  
consistent trade with the white  
racist government of South  
Africa. I do realize though the  
“catch 22” situation they are  
put in. The U.S.A. sells Israel  
military weapons. (Soviet Union  
supplies much of the Arab  
world.) In turn, Israel sells them  
to Guatemala. Therefore the  
U.S.A. eases its own public  
pressure and can say, “We've cut  
back our military aid to Guate-  
mala.” South Africa is one of  
the few countries that will do  
business and trade with Israel.  
Israel does not have very much  
worldwide trade so these ties are  
important to its economy. I am  
not defending these brutal reali-  
ties. For the most part money  
makes the world politics go  
round. In this, Israel is no  
different than any other coun-  
try! If not for anti-semitism,  
then why is it that Israel is  
receiving so much world criti-  
cism without exposing the poli-  
tical set-ups that are behind it?  
Why is Israel as a tiny nation  
such a threat to the world?  

From my understanding, in  
order to put an end to the  
P.L.O.’s fatal attacks on Israeli  
civilians, Israel militarily forced  
the P.L.O. out of the West Bank.  
The P.L.O. had for years been  
storing military weapons to use  
against Israel. In aggressing  
across the border into Lebanon,  
Israel discovered far more  
amounts of weapons and equip-  
ment than expected. They con-  
tinued their military aggression  
into Beirut, consistently finding  
greater amounts of military  
storage planned to be used  
against them! The P.L.O. had  
been storing major amounts of  
military surplus in places with  
large civilian populations! I do  
not believe it is Israel’s goal to  
be imperialistic. They recently  
returned to Egypt the Sinai  
gained in the 1967 war, in order  
to establish a peace treaty. Israel  
has a tiny population and has  
everything to lose in losing the  
lives of its youth.  

None of us know all the  
facts. The media is controlled by  
governments and big money.  
That's who decides what gets  
printed, what doesn’t and how it  
gets presented. It is known that  
the head of the Red Cross  
(branch of the Red Crescent in  
the Mideast) is the brother of  
the leader of the P.L.O. There is  
evidence now that the number  
of Lebanese and Palestinian  
casualties publicized in the  
media was greatly exaggerated.  
I was shocked to read of  
articles in England and the  
media equating the war in  
Lebanon to the Nazi Holocaust:  
the Holocaust was a racist, genocidal and  
sadistic attempt to annihilate the  
Jews (and Gays, Gypsies, Poloti-  
cos...). If not for anti-semitism,  
then why did the media choose  
to make this comparison? Why  

was Israel’s attempt to protect  
itself given so much more  
worldwide negative attention  
than Britain’s Falkland Island  
War? It scares me even deeper  
the amount of anti-semitism I  
feel coming from the leftist  
press, the feminist press and  
from other Jews.  

Israel was declared a state in  
1948, after the Nazi concentra-  
tion camps, after the Russian  
Pogroms, or the Spanish  
Inquisition or a long history  
of Jews persecuted. The purpose of  
the state was to provide a  
homeland, a place that validates the  
Jewish identity.
