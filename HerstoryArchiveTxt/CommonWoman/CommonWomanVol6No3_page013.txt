Poetry in

poetry was not of the highly
polished, correctly metered type
but the directness and strength
of the content delineated worlds
of joy and pain. These poets
spoke of the lives of women
as they experienced them with-
out the heroic metaphors of
men, without turning another
being into a symbol. Speaking of
and for themselves... we take it
for granted but it is still new for
women to do so.

the violence done to women that
is such a matter of course in this
misogynist world. There were
poems about incest, being a
battered child, the violation of
women when they are presented
as meat at the Fair in Fontaine’s
poem, It Hurts. This sort of
violence is routine in too many
women’s lives. Women who
survive to tell about it are not
generally considered heroic,
more often they are blamed
for inciting it. When women
speak for themselves though, the
dirty secret of women hating
comes out again and again. Dolly
Fleming’s poem Campaign of
Terror (printed in this issue)
connects the general “atrocities
and violations” surrounding her
in the world announced on the
news, read in the paper with two
personal instances of violations.
She makes clear the microcosm
of violent males in the reality
behind the macrocosm of a
world of atrocities. But she does
not feel herself powerless in the
face of this and vows to write
her poetry in “my own woman’s

ASSESSMENT OF PRIOR LEARNING

Established in 1972, Burlington College is dedicated to the education of adults.
One way we address our mission of treating our adult students as individuals is by
offering a seminar each semester to help adults in the area assess their prior
learning for possible college credit. This learning may have come from independent
study, on-the-job training or life experiences. It is described and evaluated in a
portfolio. A team of experts, assembled by the Office of External Programs of the
Vermont State Colleges evaluates the portfolio and certifies the credit. Transcripts
may then be sent back to Burlington College or to other colleges. This Life Experience
Assessment Program (LEAP) is an excellent way for self-educated adults to gain
advanced standing toward a college degree.

Burlington College admits students of any race, national or ethnic origin, color, religion, age, sex or handicap.

blood if necessary.’ Gwen Sher-
vington’s Women of the World
Beware has a similar awareness
and she makes clear the problem
is men because “they are ruled
by the bone not the brain.”

Nell Rose came and sat
closer to the audience to read
her poem To Marjorie’s House
about running away from home.
The poem is a wrenching mixture
of humor and pain, pitting
the innocence and liveliness of a
child against the soul-crushing of
an abusive mother whom the
poet later tries to understand as
a woman.

Lyn Lifshin was the guest
poet and her appearance was
definitely set off from the rest
of the program. I loved her
poem Sorry, a non-apology
for not apologizing and her
commitment to breaking out of
all the conventions to declare
herself and be a poet. Her last
poem, however, showed that she
still may be pleasing some of the
conventional gods.

All the poets seated them-
selves in the audience to read
Diane Wrede Mortier’s poem,
I’m a Woman, an ode to all
women. Michyo Cornell and
Gwen Shervington effectively
dramatized Audre Lorde’s poem
Need: A Choral for Black
Women’s Voices, a devastating
look at the oppression of black
women by black men. This is a
hard look at the reality of those
preyed upon by a dominant
white society preying on those
in an even weaker position.

Things tightened up for a bit

after intermission with some
songs by Katie Woolf and a
series of poems mostly about
nature. Mortier’s The Peach and
Cornell’s Secret Spring were two
poems I particularly liked. Roma
Mortensen’s Missing the Ring
was a succinct picture of the
setbacks incurred when reaching
for something one wants doesn't
work. Racille Hammrell’s I Pay
Cash was a witty ode to the
realities of modern life about
paying a therapist for support.

It is impossible for me to
remember all of the poetry
heard that night so the reader is
merely getting a glimpse of the
evening and my personal taste. It
was too long, too much to
absorb and yet I was not bored.
It was exciting to me because
these poems covered so much
ground. They were not the
polite parlor poetry so often
popular in Vermont, Robert
Frost beaming benignly in the
background. This mix of women
married and raising families,
lesbian and raising consciousness,
black and Asian surviving
to speak in an ultra white state,
divorced and self-determined,
made the poetry especially alive
for me. Jan Clausen has referred
to the women’s movement as a
movement of poets. Indeed it is
because for women language as
much as anything has been a
tool to define and imprison us.
Thanks to Michyo Cornell and
Marcia Goldberg for organizing
the evening. And thanks to all
the women who are helping us
break out of these confines
through self-definition.

infant formula, and disclosure of
industry contributions to health
care workers for research, travel, etc.
Free samples of formula are
allowed only for those infants
who have to be fed on breast-
milk substitutes, and then
should continue for the duration
of that infant’s need.

In May 1981 the World
Health Assembly voted 118-1 to
approve the WHO marketing
code. The United States was the
only country to vote against the
code. Elliot Abrams, currently
Assistant Secretary of State for
Human Rights, explained the
U.S. vote by saying the ban on
direct advertising to consumers
“runs counter to our constitu-
tional guarantees of free speech
and freedom of information,”
even though legal opinions
issued by the Department of
Justice in both the Carter and
Reagan administrations con-
cluded there would be no
problem in adopting the code.

What has been Wyeth’s
marketing practices? Wyeth
claims that their marketing prac-
tices are ethical, and notes that
it is Nestlé who has been the
target of consumer action. It is
certainly true that most people
are familiar with the Nestlé
boycott, while few had heard of
Wyeth until recently. The fact is
that Wyeth, along with Abbott
and Bristol-Myers, has, and con-

tinues to use the same promo-
tional techniques as Nestlé.

There were two main rea-
sons why Nestlé was targeted for
the boycott. The American-
based companies were subject to
pressure from stockholder reso-
lutions introduced by concerned
Church groups. One company,
Borden, ended promotion in
Third World countries in 1977 in
response to stockholder con-
cerns. Because Nestlé is a Swiss
company no stockholder pres-
sure could be brought against
them. At the same time Nestlé
has the largest share of the world
market — approximately half of
total sales. The only way then to
bring pressure against Nestlé was
through consumer action.

In response to these pres-
sures companies have changed
some of their practices, such as
advertising through the mass
media. However they have only
changed their techniques, not
lessened their promotional
efforts. Marketing practices are
now more heavily focused on
health care workers and institu-
tions.

Wyeth is second in sales of
infant formula in developing
countries, according to Doug Clements,
head of the American chapter of the Inter-
national Baby Food Action
Network (IBFAN). Wyeth is
currently the most aggressive
company in its marketing pro-
motion in these countries.
Examples of recent Wyeth viola-
tions of the WHO code include:
distribution of free samples
through health care personnel;
use of sales personnel to pro-
mote the use of formula both
through health care facilities and
directly to the mothers; infant
formula cans which do not
depict the need to sterilize and
refrigerate formula; “educa-
tional” booklets on breastfeeding which include ads for
infant formula; and posters
in health care clinics.
Concerned citizens have

formed a group called Wyeth
Watchers to both publicize
Wyeth’s practices and to bring
pressure on them to conform
to the WHO code. Wyeth Watch-
ers was successful in getting
encouraging Wyeth to agree to
the code. The House was able to
gather 50 sponsors for the
resolution, and committee hear-
ings were held in both houses.
However key Republicans in the
two houses were able to block
the resolutions from being deba-
ted and voted on. Wyeth
Watchers plans to work with
IBFAN to monitor Wyeth’s
marketing practices and to con-
tinue to publicize this issue in
Vermont.

Some state officials and
newspapers have tried to frame
the issue as one of “Economy vs.
Morality." The plant will provide
jobs for Vermonters and
benefit the dairy industry. They
are concerned that adverse pub-
licity may cause Wyeth to locate
elsewhere. For Wyeth to build
this plant in Allentown, PA, or
anywhere else, is not the intent
of Wyeth Watchers. The goal is,
and remains, to pressure Wyeth
to stop its unethical marketing practices.

involved with these efforts is
