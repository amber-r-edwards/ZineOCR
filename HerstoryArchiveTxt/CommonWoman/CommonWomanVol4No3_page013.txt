“Healing Art’’  
By Mary Walimyn  

(The Healing Art of Clara  
Walter, by Clara Walter. Alyson  
Publications. $2.95)  

Clara Walter, a 93-year-old  
registered nurse, born in Soviet  
Russia, has spent 53 years  
developing a technique of natural  
treatment for debilitated  
people.  

Walter had been plagued by  
abscesses on various parts of her  
body as a young woman, followed  
by increased temperature,  
inflammation of the sinuses,  
stomach seizures and diarrhea.  
After being involved in a car  
accident which left her lower  
extremities paralyzed, and abandoned  
as hopeless by the medical  
profession, she set out to  
rehabilitate herself.  

She went on a complete fast  
for 21 days, began drastic and  
continuous internal cleansing  
(irrigation), freeing her body of  
stagnant waste material. After  
allowing her body total rest, she  
followed a limited diet of  
natural whole foods, mostly  
uncooked fruits and vegetables.  
Within a month she was completely  
mobile. Her hypothesis, that many  
diseases are caused, in  
considerable measure, by consumption  
of devitalized foods, fats (mainly  
animal), and refined  

starches, and by the intake of  

large quantities of demands credence.  

The concept presented is  
that a pain in the head results  
from functional disorder, affecting  
the nervous system, glands  

and internal secretions, and that  
it involves the metabolic pro-  
cesses of the organs as a whole.  
Thorough elimination renews  
the organ and improves function-  
ing, as a living organism is an  
individual whole, not merely an  
assemblage of connected, but  
independent, parts, and should  
be treated as an entity. Thus,  
through cleansing the entire  
system, the cause is removed and  
the affected organs are revital-  
ized.  

The biological basis of this  
principle is that all of the vital  
organs are dependent upon the  
efficiency of the excretory sys-  
tem and are unable to function  
properly unless internal wastes  
are eliminated. Excessive bile  
secreted due to overeating acts  
as a powerful nerve depressant.  
Devitalized foods, unbalanced  
consumption, wrong combina-  
tions, insufficient mastication,  
all impair metabolic processes,  
which results in an impure  
bloodstream carrying waste to  
all parts of the body, causing  
toxicity, defective functioning  
and lowered vitality. These sys-  
temic poisons can become local-  
ized in any given organ. Accord-  
ing to Walter, these organs can  
be revitalized by a regime of  
cleansing, fasting, dieting, cor-  
rective exercise and massage. She  
goes on to explain her program  
of detoxifying the organism  

through various channels of  
elimination by a consistently  
applied process of internal  
hygiene.  

Walter lists case histories,

along with photos of success-  
fully treated persons in both  
Russia and America. She talks  
briefly but descriptively about  
self-help for hospitalized, surgi-  
cal and recuperating patients.  
Although the focus is on the  
terminally ill, healthy women  
could utilize her theories and  
practice to rid their bodies of  
toxic materials and enjoy revital-  
ization of all their body organs.  

This is a small but powerful  
book that should be read at least  
once by all women who practice  
self-help care.
