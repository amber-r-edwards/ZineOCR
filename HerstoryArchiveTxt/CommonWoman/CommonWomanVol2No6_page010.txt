It was six p.m. on the  
evening of December 14 when  
25 women from the Greater  
Upper Valley area began gather-  
ing in a downstairs conference  
room of Alice Peck Day Hospital  
in Lebanon.

The New Hampshire women  
came from Hanover and Leban-  
on; Cornish, Canaan and Clare-  
mont. From Vermont the wom-  
en came from Thetford and  
Chelsea; Vershire, Post Mills and  
Woodstock.

The youngest woman was  
16; the oldest almost 50. Some  
were homemakers; two were  
therapists. There were writers  
and weavers, potters and teach-  
ers. It was a diverse group in age  
and occupation. But in one  
respect there was agreement.  
Each was searching for a safe,  
convenient and low-risk form of  
birth control.

Their search had led them  
to the Lebanon gathering where  
they had invited staff from the  
New Hampshire Feminist Health  
Center to present a workshop on  
the cervical cap, a recently  
rediscovered form of birth con-  
trol attracting increasing interest  
from women disenchanted with  
the more widely available op-  
tions.

Like the diaphragm, the  
cervical cap is a barrier form of  
birth control. However, unlike  
the diaphragm, it fits tightly  
over the cervix and can be left in  
the vagina for days.

In the United States, the  
cap fell into disuse in the middle  
of the century. However, it is  
still used in Europe, particularly  
in England, as a birth control  
method.

N.H. Feminist Health Cen-  
ter is among the first organiza-  
tions in the country to once  
again make the cap available. It  
has been dispensing the thimble-  
like rubber device since June and  
over 200 women have been  
fitted with it.

However, the “group fit-  
ting” with the women from the  
Upper Valley area was a “first”  
for the women’s health facility.

“We've never done anything  
like this before,” said health  
worker Sandra Malasky in her  
opening remarks. The audience  
laughed:

Planned Parenthood of Vermont  
strongly supports an individual’s right to voluntary  
fertility control and offers reproductive medical  
care, counseling and educational services to all who  

want them including:

* Gynecological exams and breast exams  
* Pregnancy testing and counseling  
* Referrals  
* Sterilization information for both  

ber of women called back in  
reply.

Dinny Forbes and Dawna  
Markova, from Hanover and  
Sharon, Vermont, respectively,  
were the two organizers of the  
unusual event.

Markova, like many of the  
women attending, had experi-  
enced worrisome side effects  
from oral contraceptives. Also,  
she had expelled the IUD and  
found the diaphragm both  
“messy” and inconvenient.

In the fall, Markova hap-  
pened upon an article about the  
cervical cap in WomenWise. She  
shared her desire to be fitted  
with the device with her friend,  
Dinny Forbes.

“Through word of mouth,  
interest began snowballing,”  
Forbes recalled. It was Forbes  
who began referring to the group  
as “The Upper Valley Cervical  
Cap Brigade.”

Unable to find any health  
practitioners in the area who  
provided the cap (or “many who  
had even heard of it,” added  
Forbes), the women made con-  
tact with NHFHC.

According to Sarah Berndt  
of NHFHC, New Hampshire  
“has the most people able to fit  
caps.”

Still, there are only a  
handful of cervical cap providers  
in the state and none serve the  
Upper Valley area, she said.

After a discussion and slide  
presentation on the history and  
effective use of the cap as a birth  
control method, the women  
broke up into smaller groups for  
fittings.

Eleven women left with  
cervical caps. Fourteen were  
disappointed.

“On the whole, we’re find-  

ing about six out of 10 women  
can have a good fitting,” ex-  
plained Betty Mitchell of the  
Feminist Health Center.

A “good” fitting, she ex-  
plained, is a snug fit over the  
cervix. However, the limited  
range of available types and sizes  
of the device accounts for the  
majority of unsuccessful fittings.

The Health Center acquires  
its caps from a firm in London,  
England, due to the lack of a  
United States manufacturer. Mit-  
chell spoke of the Center’s  
interest in finding a supplier that  
provided a wider range of caps  
to improve the percentage of  
women able to be fitted with it.

Some women are also un-  
able to use the cap successfully  
due to difficulty in either fitting  
it herself or in removing it.

“Using the cap means get-  
ting to know your own ana-  
tomy,” said Mitchell. “Many  
doctors feel women can’t do  
this,” she added, “but we're  
just not finding this to be the  
case very often.”

Mitchell, who has recently  
sent out a follow-up question-  
naire to the women she has  
fitted since June, summed up  
the enthusiasm being generated  
by the reemergence of the  
cervical cap.

“We know the perfect con-  
traceptive method doesn’t exist,  
but we're talking about options.  
And it's exciting to be able to  
offer women more of a choice,”  
she said.
