to say that the political, religious  
and economic destinies of the  
Irish have been controlled by the  
British for centuries.  

Between the late 1600s and  
the beginning of the 20th  
century, secret societies formed  
to retaliate against the British  
lords who owned their land,  
denied them their rights to  
education and to an internally  
run government. What emerged  
was a nationalist faction working  
toward the abolition of discrimination,  

In 1912, on the wings of a  
tremendous nationalist fervor, a  
Home Rule bill for Ireland  
passed the English parliament.  
Then, the British, fearing the  
consequences of an Ireland ruled  
by the Irish, withdrew the bill.  
In response, the Irish Republican  
Brotherhood planned an army  
uprising for Easter week of  
1916. (The time was chosen as  
symbolic of the resurrection of  
Ireland.) The nationalists were  
crushed after a week of fighting,  
with several Irish leaders execu-

On October 27, Bernadette  
Devlin McAliskey came to Bur-  
lington, her visit sponsored by  
the Vermont Committee on Irish  

Human Rights. Bernadette, a  
civil rights activist in Northern  
Ireland since the late 1960s,  
spoke quietly but forcefully to a  
capacity crowd at Trinity  
College.  

She traced 800 years of  
British oppression of the Irish.  
The first invasion of Ireland by  
the English took place in the  
12th century. Wealthy Welsh-  
Normans took over large tracts  

of Irish land and a few years later, established a government  
in Dublin. For some unknown  
reason, the Normans assimilated  
into the Irish culture rapidly and  
so completely that the Normans  
were described as “more Irish  
than the Irish themselves.”  

The British powers found  
this assimilation abominable and  
tried to discourage it by legis-  
lating Irish culture. The Irish  
language was outlawed, Irish  
were not allowed to vote, bear  
weapons or own land. The  
penalty for breaking these laws  
was death. His acceptance caused much  
dissent within the ranks of the  
IRA.  

It would take a lot of space  
to explain the history of the  
oppression of Ireland. Suffice it

IRISH IRE  

Since then, the IRA has  
carried on underground. Despite  
the tenseness of the situation,  
relative quiet held between the  
end of the 1950s and 1968. In  
1969, the fighting was taken to  
the streets, and British troops  
were ordered to Ireland to  
protect the nationalists. Predic-  
tably, the troops quickly became  
aligned with the oppressors. So  
not only were the Irish vic-  
timized by the British control of  
the police force, but had to  
deal with the harassment by the  
army sent there to “maintain  
peace.”  

The murders and incarcera-  
tion of Irish civil rights workers  
still occurs today. Justice is  
nonexistent in Northern Ireland.  
People are jailed and tortured  
without fair trial and often with  
no piece of evidence to hold  
them in the first place. Refusing  
information to a constable is  
enough cause to be detained  
(and possibly tortured). The vast  
majority of the prisoners in the  
concentration camps of Ireland  
are there because of signed  
“confessions” to crimes never  
committed. In her lecture, Ber-  
nadette made it clear that  
evidence showed the “confes-  
sions” were elicited after tor-  
ture.  

One tactic of the prisoners  
was to stage internationally  
publicized hunger strikes to  
draw attention to their in-  
humane treatment in the prison.  
Prisoners have demanded the  
right to wear their own clothes  
since wearing prison garb vali-  
dates that their political dissent  
is criminal. Until this demand is  
met, prisoners will wear only a  
blanket. Political prisoners want  
to be able to communicate with  
their families and to be released  
from virtual solitary confine-  
ment to exercise, read or visit  
with other prisoners.  

The conditions of women in  
the prisons is appalling. Toilets  
have been locked up, and then  
the women punished and beaten  
for attempting to rid their cells  
of excrement. A “dirty protest”  
was initiated where all excrement  
was smeared on the walls  
of the cells. Sanitary napkins are  
rationed out and thrown into  
the cells, with no bags permitted  
for disposal. Under these cir-  
cumstances, infection and other  
serious medical problems are  
rampant. No physician is avail-  
able to the women participating  
in the “dirty protest.”  

Meanwhile in the streets,  
violence against the Irish con-  
tinues. The Irish live in constant  
fear that their homes will be  
entered for no good reason,  
that they will be “detained” by  
the police without evidence or  
due process of law, and that  
their children will be shot on  
sight while out playing. British  
soldiers’ use of the plastic bullet  
is increasing. The bullet,  
approximately 4 inches long and  
manufactured in the U.S., has  
been fired short range at school  
children’s heads as they're out  
playing or running errands.  

As an Irishwoman, it is  
difficult to describe the anguish  
and anger I felt hearing Bern-  
adette’s first-hand account of  
Northern Irish life. I felt choked  
by the knowledge of what is  
happening in Ireland and  
shocked to hear her use of the  
word “pogrom” to describe  
police activity there. Imagine  
my horror when I found  
Gallagher, on the list of Irish  
children wounded by plastic  
bullets.  

This is the first time I ever  
fully realized that I belong to  
a people long oppressed, a proud  
people who have no other  
recourse than violence. The  
portrayal of the provisional IRA  
as “terrorists” enrages and  
sickens me. The IRA is merely  
doing what the people of El  
Salvador and the Blacks in South  
Africa are striving to do:  
control their own destinies. The  
IRA is responding to the terror  
they feel about Britain's slow  
strangulation of an entire peo-  
ple, and in that fear, I suppose  
could be labelled “terrorists.”  

In my mind, the time for neg-  
tiation has long passed. Violence  
is the only appropriate response.
