BATUIRQIES  
CONVERSATION: FEMINIST  

THERAPY  

By Dian Kendrick Mueller  

(The following is a  
conversation between Dian  
Kendrick Mueller, a member of  
the Commonwoman collective,  

and Carol McKnight, a  
psychotherapist with the  

Creamery in Shelburne. This is  
part of a continuing series on  
feminist therapy.)  

DIAN KENDRICK  
MUELLER: In your practice,  
have you seen any changes in  
your clients that you would  
attribute to the women’s  
movement?  

CAROL McKNIGHT: The  
change I've noticed more is with  
my friends and in myself over  
the last 10 years. I think the  
changes I notice in my clients  
partly reflect my new  
awarenesses and my changes. A  
trend that appears to me to be  
going on is that the women I see  
seem able to change a little more  
easily right now and are  
becoming more independent in  
emotional realms than the men,  
whereas the men are going  
through a period of having to  
grow up and handle their own  
pain and their own emotional  
needs, instead of having a  
woman do that for them.  

DIAN: I think that’s true. I  
think that men are seeing that  
they’re not going to get that  
kind of emotional nurturance  
from women anymore — at least,  
not from the women they know.  
And there are several reactions  
to that: one would be to run off  
with another woman, if you  
could find somebody who fit the  
bill; and the other would be to  
change in response—  

CAROL: That's right. To  
develop that nurturing for  
themselves as well as be able to  
give it out to a woman, for  
example.  

DIAN: But you are also  
saying that you think women are  
becoming more independent  
emotionally. In the past, just as  
men have been dependent on  
women for nurturing, women  
have been dependent on men for  
something —  

CAROL: There’s a balance.  
There's something that women  
get out of fulfilling those needs  
for men — they get to feel that  
they belong and that they’re  
important and that they're  
needed. And if women don't  
accept that role and pull back  
and aren't always there to patch  
things up or to make the man  
feel better, that would be a way  
in which I see women becoming  
more independent.  

DIAN: But even though this is  
true, that both men and women  
are more able to take care of  
their own needs, you do think  
that people need each other?  
That we do need some  
nurturing?  

CAROL: Oh, yes. The part  
that I see as changing is being  
symbiotic and interdependent in  
ways that are not healthy and  
that keep people tied to each  
other and not free to grow or to  
be themselves. Changing that  
leaves people freer to share and  
be together in ways that are  
healthy and meaningful for both  
of them.  

I'm speaking about that group  
of my clients where I see the  
change. I certainly have a lot of  
clients where I don't see that  
particular trend.  

DIAN: In traditional therapy,  
if I came in and said that I  
wasn't unhappy with my role as  

a mother and a housewife and a  
wife; but I was unhappy about  
something, I didn’t know what, I  
think the therapist would  
attempt to help me to accept my  
life and somehow find sources of  
self-esteem within my role,  
within my limits.  

Feeling as I do very strongly  
that a woman is going to be  
easily depressed, is going to be  
low in self-esteem if she only has  
her husband and her children as  
sources of approval, I would find  

FEATUR  

DIAN: When men come in, I  
suppose it’s the same kind of  
thing — that some of them are  
going to be satisfied or say they  
are with their role, and some of  
them won't be satisfied and will  
actually be ready to change. I  
suppose you wouldn’t push a  
man who didn’t want to change  
his life, but if you saw that the  
man did want to change his role  
that you'd help him do so?  

CAROL: Yes. The therapeutic  

situation itself would be helping:  

I find it very hard to work with a  
woman who was with me  
because she was unhappy but at  
the same time didn’t want to  
change her situation in life. I  
think I'd push her to make  
changes.  

CAROL: I would make  
suggestions and present new  
possibilities. But if a person  
ended up feeling better and  
didn't want to make any of  
those changes I would not think  
it was my job to push her.  
DIAN: You think that you  
can help a woman to feel better  
without changing her life? So  
that she’d just be changing the  
way she felt about herself or the  

way she felt about her life, she  
wouldn't be changing her  
lifestyle?  
CAROL: I think that for  
some women that’s possible.  
What may happen is that three  
years later she may find that she  
has a lot of new urges and  
interests and come back into  
therapy to make some major  
changes in another direction —  
going out and getting a job, for  
instance. But for some women  
and also for some periods of  
time in a woman's life, such  
major changes may not be  
necessary.  

DIAN: I think that probably  
if we expect to reproduce and  
bring up children, it’s important  
for a woman to spend some time  
at home with the children and  
have that as her major focus.  

CAROL: Since I have two  
small children and never liked  
staying at home, I don’t think  
that would ever have been good  
for me.  

to make those kinds of  
changes. Presumably anyone  
who comes into therapy has  
come in for some change, so we  
would work to that goal and  
then see what's happening next,  
if the client is available for more  
changes and more insight at that  
time, or if that’s it for now. I  
don’t see it necessarily as a  
steady process.  

DIAN: Do you think that the  
men you see know that the  
women in their lives are  
changing in response to the  
women’s movement?  

CAROL: Many of the men I  
see are noticing a change. Some  
of the men I see are coming  
from a more traditional point of  
view and don’t understand  
what's happening — they think  
it’s unnecessary and that it’s just  
a phase. Then I’ve seen some  
men who don’t really notice —  
just that something’s different  
and something's wrong, but they  
don’t know what it is.  

DIAN: Are there many men  
who really welcome the change?  

CAROL: Yes. I certainly see  
some men who really welcome  
the change and see it as an  
opportunity for themselves also  
to grow up in some important  
ways and to learn some new  
things about themselves in  
conjunction with or alongside of  
or separate from the women in  
their lives.  

DIAN: I've read that there are  
many men who look down from  
great heights at “hysterical”  
women — male doctors looking  
down on their female patients,  
male therapists disdaining their  
female clients, husbands having  
contempt for their “hysterical”  
wives — but that these same men  
really need these women,  
because they feel vicariously  
through them.  

CAROL: That makes a lot of  
sense to me. I see a man having  
his feeling side repressed and  
hidden, probably through some  
fear or disdain for that part of  
himself, and then having the  
woman in his life expressing it  
for him. That's the same kind of  
dynamic, I think, that can  
happen in a family when one  
child is acting out the conflicts  
and the emotions that the  
parents are not showing.  

DIAN: I think that using a  
child as an example is good,  
because I think that in many  
ways some men see women as  
infantile, as childish, as children  
— mental and emotional  
children. So, in a relationship  
between a man and a woman,  
the man could be rather cold  
and unfeeling and objective and  
dispassionate and all this, while  
the woman could go sort of  
haywire, screaming and crying  
and carrying on. And he’s going  
to be disgusted with all this on  
the surface, but at the same time  
I think he is getting something  
from it.  

I think that when a woman is  
“hysterical” she is likely to  
blame herself, while an angry  
man will often blame someone  
or something outside himself. I  
think that women are more  
likely to internalize guilt.  

CAROL: Me too. A lot of the  
work I end up doing with  
women who are thinking that  
way about themselves is helping  
them consolidate a stronger  
adult, a stronger perception of  
what is really happening outside  
of themselves — what really did  
happen, who said what, who is  
actually responsible. It’s kind of  
data collecting and really  
assessing a situation so it's a step  
removed from feeling it’s all  
their fault and so they start to  
see what really is going on in the  
world around them.  

To some extent, I think we all  
may be responsible for living  
vicariously. Often women who  
seem to accept their role at  
home may be feeling through  
their children and living through  
them.  

DIAN: Yes. As said, maybe  
the reason men live vicariously  
through women is that they do  
think women are children. It’s  
all right for the “child” to  
behave childishly, and the man  
can somehow get his jollies from  
that, but he himself, of course, is  
too grownup to act childishly. I  
think women are encouraged to  
be emotional in order to keep  
them in their “place.”  

CAROL: I think that can be a  
problem in therapy, too, if  
therapy is largely focused on  
getting in touch with your  
feelings and expressing them and  
isn’t also including the thinking  
parts and “what is happening  
here,” then it could serve as a  
continuing reinforcement of  
behavior you might want to  
change.  

Women often have learned  
certain emotional responses are  
okay — like crying — whereas  
anger isn’t okay. So I might be  
encouraging women to feel and  
express anger, rather than crying  
and feeling victimized. So the  
learning might still be in the area  
of feeling, but there might be a  
different aspect stressed.
