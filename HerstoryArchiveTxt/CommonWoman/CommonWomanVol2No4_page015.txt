Who’s  
the Enemy  

Dear Sisters of Commonwoman,  

I have been reading about  
this no nuke benefit contro-  
versy. I was there, and I had a  
great time. I stayed only for the  
first set and that was a dance  
highlight for me.  

Lynn and I have two very  
different experiences of what  
was going on at the moment in  
question. The crowd was mixed,  
because nuclear energy actively

Lynn announced the important  
happenings, talking about the  
Women’s House and saying there  
was a men against rape group  
starting. I noticed people con-  
necting with this announcement  
with approval and support.  
From my observation point I  
saw no sneering or bad mouth-  
ing.  
I'm glad that Jed wrote to  
Commonwoman. I feel that  
with the importance of the  
nuclear issue, energy spent on  
compulsive divisiveness can only  
be destructive. Please remember  
what Flo Kennedy said about  
owning our niggerdom. We need  
to be together; our power is in  
our numbers and our fire.  
Jed Lowy is not the enemy  
and neither is Lynn Vera.  
All power to us, the people,  
Susan Linskey  

Kudos  

Dear Wimmin of  
Commonwoman,  

it has entered my conscious-  
ness lately that putting out  
Commonwoman is a difficult job  
on many levels. I am aware that  
you are all struggling with your  
time commitment, personal  
struggles, political struggles and

more, I want you all to know  
that I appreciate and respect  
the work you are all doing.  

I am now sharing parts of  
my thoughts and struggle  
through Commonwoman  

because of two changes. (1) I  
am being more a part of this  
community than I was before  
now. (2) I am realizing again and  
again that being part of a strug-  
gle means sharing and not taking  
things for granted. Change is  
hard and it’s necessary that we  
communicate and appreciate  
each other.  

Thank you again,

P.S. More good thoughts so.  
don't forget. I get excited every  
time (especially this last time)  
that Commonwoman is due.  

Also I feel like Common-  

woman is an open forum for  
different aspects and shades of  
wimmin’s views — I think it’s  
good.  

Oppression  

Dear Commonwoman,  

Am enclosing $3 for six  
issues of Commonwoman. While  
sending in for my subscription, I  
could not help but notice that  
you provide Commonwoman  
free to women in prisons. I can  
only hope that not making the  
same offer to women in mental  
institutions was an oversight.  

I strongly urge that this be  
considered. There is no group of  
women more oppressed than  
women in mental institutions!  
Exploitation and oppression by  
the psychiatric profession has a  
long history in this country and  
it is an issue that cannot be  
ignored:  

Thank you,

Dear Commonwoman,  
I am more than happy to  
renew my subscription. You'll  

find my check and form  
enclosed,  

Having moved away from  
Burlington, it’s wonderful to  

receive your paper, as I can still  
be informed of the goings on of  
the women’s community. It's  
beautiful to see your production  
of such an excellent paper in  
such a short period of time. At  
this point, I really can’t provide  
any suggestions for improve-  
ment. I only wanted to say that  
I love reading it and wish you  
continued growth and success.  

In sisterhood,

Becoming  

Dear Commonwoman,  

In passing through, your  
paper came into hand. With  
blissful blithe to levitation, I  
rejoice for womyn...  

“Life is the same, and ever  
changing. It is not a question of  
being and nothing, but a ques-  
tion of being and becoming.  
Becoming once we accept exis-  
tence, with or without meaning.  
I cannot escape this world, I can  
only change it, or it should  
change me. This is in essence  
where I stand, sit and run.”  

From one seeker to another,

The main thing I liked  
about the Rainbow Suite was  
that the company was convinc-  
ing in its expression of “a  
rainbow.” We were aware of the  
individual bodies on stage for  
there were no distracting cos-  
tumes, yet the bodies seemed to

of the opposite sex. It is a vision  
of grandeur.” In reference to  
these instances, Wilda noted  
that, “Professors should be able  
to say what they want, but they  

must qualify that it is their  
opinion.”  
Because of this negative  

feedback which many gay stu-  
dents experience on campus, the  
GSU must provide necessary  
support for them. Through her  
work with campus speakers  
bureaus on sexuality and the  
GSU activities (e.g. coffeehouses  
and meetings), Wilda strives  
merely to inform people that  
gay minorities are present. These  
activities provide strength for  
the gay students who still feel  
uneasy about revealing their  
sexual identities. Wilda is one  
woman who is fighting the  
media which “portrays gay peo-  
ple as monsters... with many  
stereotypes.” She would like to  
see a “stronger and more viable  
GSU” at UVM to uphold the  
rights of women in a gay life-  
style and also those of men.  

The general attitude toward  
the GSU at UVM is much more  
liberal when compared to the  
attitude that Middlebury College  
has towards its GSU: at UVM  
the students may print  
announcements publicly in the  
newspaper and their annual  
budget is hundreds of dollars  
more than the meager Middle-  
bury sum of $25. But still UVM  
is a solitary wagon train, left far  
behind other undergraduate and  
professional schools (i.e. NYU,  
Yale and Harvard) which have  
sped ahead on the path to  
antidiscrimination policies and  
gay legal studies programs.

be the actual rainbow. You  
knew there were people up there  
dancing yet you were immersed in  
the colors and changes in the  
elements of light that they were  
showing us. Also I liked that  
there was no emphasis placed on  

the men in the group, as so often  
happens in dance companies.  
They were part of the group,  
like everyone else. A true work  
of art, yes, on the part of the  
dancers and especially the chor-  
eographer, Nancy Watkin.
