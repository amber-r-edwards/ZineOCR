LETTERS

Dear Commonwoman Staff  
and Readers:

An uncommon woman on  
the Commonwoman staff asked  
me to write something about my  
experiences blockading at Law-  
rence Livermore Labs, as a  
preface to my statement which I  
had submitted to Common-  
woman. At the time I was asked  
to write this I was in the process  
of relocating to the East, trying  
to figure out how to economically  
survive, dealing with the  
just-learned fact that my daughter  
had been sexually abused by  
her father, and going through a  
very painful, unresolved parting  
with my lover. I spaced it out  
and my friend at Common-  
woman was stuck with trying  
to create coherence from my  
intensely emotional frequently  
stoned tales of my personal and  
political involvements with the  
Feminist Cluster and with the  
Livermore Action Group (LAG).  
Some of it got jumbled.

All of the blockaders at the  
Feb. ‘82 blockade at Livermore  
were offered community service  
as an alternative to staying in  

jail. I was advocating not accept-  

ing that sentence because I felt it  
was based on class, race and  
privilege. Women imprisoned  
for economic or other political  
crimes are not offered an alter-

$ for you  

It also says something  
about ‘real criminals’  
which increases and reinforces  
fear of convicts, and it vali-  
dates jailing the victims of class,  
race, gender, and hetero-oppression.  
Community service is  
reserved for people with power  
in the patriarchy.

I feel that being offered  
community service reflects on  
how LAG tries to present itself.  
LAG has never denied its basic  
espousal of middle-class values.  
The image it has consistently  
given is of an organization  
comprised of doctors, lawyers,  
teachers, clergy, mothers and  
grandmothers, workers — and  
other solid citizens. It ignores  
the much felt presence of the  
dykes, thieves, welfare mothers,  
dopers, whores, dealers, fairies  
and other disreputable types.  
The Feminist Cluster and others  
have been actively involved in  
trying to expose the LAG  
whitewash. This has caused a lot  
of turmoil and resulted in  
accusations of violence, trouble-  
makers and other bullshit.

Anyway I think I was  
separated from the other block-  
aders and put in Maximum  
Security because that is one of  
the things they do in jail as a  
way of making sure you know  
who really has the power, and  
discourage you from thinking  
you might get control. I think I  
was chosen because it was  
obvious that many women were  

native to jail.

I swear it to you  

and will rise!

angry, confused and fearful of  
my blunt outspokenness. There  
was only one other cluster dyke  
in jail and not a whole lot of  
trust or support from other  
women. We had also neglected  
to work out any specific jail  
solidarity strategy. This occurred  
at the Livermore blockade on  
Candlemas.

The statement that Com-  
monwoman printed was original-  

ly intended to be my statement  
at one of the subsequent (6/21)  
Livermore blockades. My affi-  
nity group SOLAR consented to  
using it as SOLAR’s statement  
to be passed out at the blockade.  
It was never used in any capacity  
because we never got our stra-  
tegy shit together and were  
arrested within minutes of initiat-  
ing the blockade AND we were  
kicked out of jail with the few  
other women committed to  
solidarity without being arraign-  
ed. The court did not want to  
hear what we had to say.

The Feminist Cluster is a  
group of all women, at least 90  
percent of us are dykes, affinity  
groups in California. We got  
together to blockade Diablo  
Canyon nuclear power plant. We  
were successful and decided we  
wanted to continue working  
together. We gather about every  
other month. The focus of our  
gathers has frequently been  
working out the logistics of our  
participation in other mass ac-  
tions. For me working with the  
Feminist has been very high,  
powerful and supportive sometimes.  
A hundred or more committed,  
strong, loud out dykes are having an impact on  
the organizing in California’s  
anti-nuke, anti-war organiza-  
tions.

Working with the cluster has  
been a very hard painful struggle  
for me sometimes, I think this is  
because we haven't yet dealt  
with how women have experi-  
enced oppression in the cluster.  
We haven’t dealt with who has  
access to MONEY and how  
much. We haven't really talked  
about “acceptable behavior and  
language” and its base in the  
middle class. We haven’t heard  
each other's stories so there is  
mistrust and assumptions. We  
need to really get down and talk  
about privilege and power in the  
cluster. And then we need to  
really define ourselves, our goals  
and our process.

We know we need to do all  
this, but it’s so scary and there’s  
so little time and there’s so  
much business to deal with every  
time we get together. Some of us  
keep struggling to be heard and  
to say what we feel, sometimes  
we get discouraged and wonder  
“why.” The Cluster has affirmed  
my knowledge that women can  
create our visions of free wom-  
en land and has shown me how  
we will extricate ourselves from  
the bonds of the patriarchy.

I swear it on my common woman's head  
The common woman is as common as a common loaf of bread —

Hello Sisters

Your newspaper is very  
good. Our store received a copy  
and we would like information  
on bookstore terms, we would  
like to carry it.

The article on Anti-Semi-  
tism and the article about  
Dovida Ishatova — wonderful —  
I was so lucky to hear and  
see her perform with her mother  
at Michigan.

Please let me know if you  
have any other back issues deal-  
ing with anti-Semitism, or Jewish  
identity, Jewish women, etc.

Thank you.

Dear Commonwoman

I’ve rewritten this letter  
three times and by now it is very  
toned down. I'm basically very  
upset that some women feel so  
politically correct supporting  
Israel taking away the Palestinian’s home and the killing of  
them in the name of stopping  
anti-Semitism. That theory is  
really jive.

Point One: There are too  
many women in the Burlington  
community that because they  
aren't Jewish get intimidated  
(out of fear of being called anti-  
Semitic) and don't speak out  
against Israel’s bad policies.

Point Two: Fifty thousand  
progressive Israelis got into the  
streets and demonstrated against  

the atrocities of the Israeli  
government.  
Question: Did Common-  

woman edit out a photo of an  
Israeli woman holding a sign  
about the PLO?  
I picked up my first copy of  
Commonwoman at Womonfyre  
in Northampton, Mass. We had  
gone there to check it out as it’s  
the closest women’s bookstore  
to us that I know about.

I was very impressed with  
Commonwoman. The articles  
were very well-written considering  
what I had expected of a 50  
cent paper.

I wish we had a more local  
version of both Commonwoman  
and EveryWoman’s Place. I'm  
beginning to be in touch with a  

place and need for conscious-  
ness-raising in this area.

The question in the center  
of the paper: What about  
changing the name to Common-  
woman and who should make  
the decision? If it feels right —  
go for it! If you've already lost  
some advertisers, etc. maybe  
being more upfront at this time  
won’t hurt.

I wished I’d found Com-  
monwoman four years ago. I  
have a feeling it would’ve helped  
me to put my puzzle together  
that much sooner.

I’m glad you've Come Out!  
Lots of praise, encouragement,  
etc. for all the women that  
function so well together and  
alone to put out a great paper. I  
wish I were closer to be an active  
part!

To the Editor/Vanguard Press;  
Editor/Vanguard Press;

Joni AvRutrick’s noone  
rationally sympathetic glance into the  
myriad of political and moral  
ironies behind anti-Semitism, and  
Carol Cohen's evocative por-  
trayal of her experience and  
identification with women while  
living in Israel — both articles  
appearing simultaneously in a  
recent issue of Commonwoman  
— make the Vanguard Press look  
almost as ridiculous as the  
Burlington Free Press in name as  
well as politics. The Vanguard  
Press has only to look back at its  
own terse, understated, and  
arrogant editorial demand that  
Israel promptly withdraw its  
military forces and play more  
peace games — like a good little  
boy, of course — to be able to  
see its own safe, conservative,  
and piously self-serving gestalt, a  
gestalt reflected just as vividly in  
most other publications of the  
press. After the futile march for  
peace comes the lofty scapegoating. It is this condescending  
political tone, which in “the  
Vanguard, at least, is the hardest  
to swallow, and which may bring  
more and more people around to  
other more inconvenient and  
embarrassing ways of thinking  
politically: more vulnerable for  
being more elusive and more  
difficult to scrutinize or cate-  
gorize. If the recent quarrel  
between the Onion River Food  
Cooperative and Common-  
woman is a vague indication of  
this discrepancy, the Vanguard  
looks more and more as if it  
were behind instead of ahead of  
the center of current political  
dogma.

dear sisters,  
I read about your publica-  
tion in CL/LL. thought maybe  
you would like to use the  
enclosed.  
I’m 35, a Jewish dyke  
disabled with arthritis. I live on  
land in the country with other  
women, and have had my poetry,  
prose, art, and photographs  
published in Sinister Wisdom,  
Common Lives, Lesbian Lives,  
Off Our Backs and Focus,  
among others.  
Good energy to you in the  
valuable work you do as women.
