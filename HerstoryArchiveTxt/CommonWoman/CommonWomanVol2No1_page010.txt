City Hall

Continued from page 6

Why did “the City of  
Burlington not plead  
“immunity?” This is now a  
moot question as the women in  
this community wait out the  
month to see if City Hall will  
indeed appeal its loss, an action  
which would cost the taxpayers  
more dollars, to the tune of  
court time and $50 per hour city  
lawyers’ fees.

This women’s community has  
been serious and committed  
enough to struggle for the last  
four years to gain this victory.

By all indications, it seems it is  
prepared to not rest on any  
laurels; rather to get on with  
whatever business is at hand, be  
it another suit in a higher court  
or a women’s cultural and social  
center with a restaurant business  
as its self-support — My Sisters’  
Place.

Women of Burlington,  
you will have your own space!!!

Picture yourself in  
Commonwoman. Send us your  
photography. (Box 242,
