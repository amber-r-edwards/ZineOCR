JEWISH CONTRADICTIONS  
In 1948 a Jewish State was created.  
From despair and hopelessness  
Jewish people saw a new hope,  
danced and sang in the streets.  

Many Arabs were thrown out of their homes.  

And the children I played with in the schoolyard  
had numbers tattooed on their arms.  

Many years pass and I fight for many causes,  
civil rights, peace and women’s liberation.  

Aware of the evils of imperialism I condemn the Jewish State,  
and also deny my own oppression as a Jew.  

In 1978 the Israeli army invades Lebanon,  
The workers in Israel demand Peace NOW!  

I open my gut to the horror  
of an invasion in the name of Jewish survival.  

And the children I played with in the schoolyard  
had numbers tattooed on their arms.  

Carter, Begin and Sadat try to work out a separate peace,  
protecting capitalism and national self-interest.  

The Palestinian nation demands world recognition.  

But the children I played with in the schoolyard had numbers tattooed on  
their arms.

When my brother brought in  

the day-old birds  

my mother took them  

for her own, warming them  

in the nest of her palms,  

cradling their downless sticky flesh  
till the yolk-sacs beat  

with survival.  

Soon enough  

the pasted eyes opened  

to beady glares, and  

maws poured forth incessantly  
their foul music  

of hunger.  

It must have pared  
at my mother’s bones  

but she went on  
poking milk-soaked crumbs  
down each frail throat in turn,  
smoothing scruffy pinfeathers  
as she looked ahead  
to flight.

CLEARING A PASTURE  

Eighty feet of ice,  
crushing and moving  
across this pasture,  

a powerful Mama glacier  
carving mountains  

and lakes  

and leaving  

for me  

a field of rocks  

to move.  

With bar and shovel  

I walk over the bones of eons  
searching for the rock  

most likely to yield.  

A contradiction in terms.  

Around a point of granite  

I circle and dig  

circle and dig.  
Before me lies a large rock,  

a grey scoop of ice cream  

in an earthen bowl.  

Bar under rock  
block under bar  
leverage  

it moves!  

But will not leave  
its cradle of dirt.  

Inching it up  

I feel glacial myself,  

but a ring of steel  

and a spark of rock  

sing it again —  
to an ancient home.  

Again and again  

I rock this stone  

as the morning ebbs  
with bloody knuckle mudpies  
on churned ground.  
Again and again  

I wobble it free,  
prop it up,  

lift and lift and  
there.  

This time,  

with  

one  

small  

precise  

movement  

it flops out  

like a newborn calf.  

And I,  

like a new mother,  

crawl to where it rests  

and hold  

my labor's stony fruit.

Letter to The Boston Fine Arts Museum  

Mankind, drink your distilled history.  
While you remain intoxicated with your own images,  
one dimensional visibility,  
still lives,  
We Amazons, anarchy-ologists, will soberly steal into your museums  
And smash your glass cases.  

We will re-turn our vessels  
reclaim our snake goddess  
our golden votive labrys.  
We want our heritage apart from your history  
and will take it.  

(No treading softly in the territory of the enemy.  

Obsession is everything.  

Let us do as little revamping as possible.  

Nothing left here is adaptable to visions of a different form.)
