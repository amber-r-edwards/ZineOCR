Beware of Winter  
White Sales  

Boycott J. P. Stevens  

By Joyce Bressler  

When you're looking for  
bargains this winter, beware of  
the linen sales (including towels,  
sheets, pillowcases and  

blankets). There is, and has been  
for several years, a boycott of J.  
P. Stevens Company products. J.  
P. Stevens is the nation’s second  
largest textile company, with 85  
plants and 45,000 workers,  

located mainly in the South. It is  
also this country’s number one  
labor law violator.  

Large corporations, based on  
profit, do not have the general  
interest or health and safety of  
their workers at heart. They  
often guard their greed for  
profit, and disinterest — in  
workers’ needs, with some  
interest to bargain in good faith.  
The only reason such employers  
take a liberal stand is as a result  
of the militant efforts of  
workers and the workers’  
movement in this country over  
the years.  

But J. P. Stevens isn’t even  
that kind of employer. J. P.  
Stevens has flagrantly violated  
health and safety standards, has  
refused to recognize unions after  
the plants voted them in, and  
therefore won't enter into  
collective bargaining. The  
boycott is the main weapon left  
to these workers.  

The Amalgamated Clothing  
and Textile Workers Union is the  
union organizing in this area.  
The strategy of the company as  
a result of union organizing has  
included: threatening to close  
plants, firing workers who  
testified before the National  
Labor Relations Board (NLRB),  
and other economic reprisals.  

Many of the J. P. Stevens  
workers are women. And here is  
what some of them have to say.  

Lucy Taylor, who has brown  
lung disease, said, “I had this  
breathin’ problem. I couldn't  
stand the dust... All they’re  
doing is giving us the  
runaround... or waiting for us to  
die.”  

“I gave J. P. Stevens 26 years  
of my life and then, when I  
needed them, they gave me  
nothing,” said Mildred Whitley.  

“I'd never let my children  
work here... I'd kill a man if he  

treated a child of mine the way  
I’ve been treated,” said Maurine  
Hedgepeth.  

And finally an unidentified  
woman said, “Before the  
election they tried to pit the  
blacks against the whites, and  
the whites against the blacks... It  
didn't work. People are smarter  
than they think.”  

The struggles of these women  
for unionization and self-respect  
is vital to all of us. Support the  
boycott of J. P. Stevens  
products, which include the  
following:  

Sheets and pillowcases:  
Beauti-Blend, Beauticale, Fine  
Arts, Peanuts, Tastemaker,  

Utica, Mohawk, Designer Labels  
Yves St. Laurent, Angelo  
Donghia.  

Towels: Fine Arts,  
Tastemaker, Utica.  

Blankets: Forstmann, Utica.  

Carpets: Contender, Gulistan,  
Merryweather, Tastemaker.  

Table Linen: Simtex.  

Hosiery: Big Mama, Finesse,  
Hip-lets, Spirit.  

Draperies: J. P. Stevens.  

In the Burlington area, Zayres  
and Woolworths carry these  
products, and there may be  
others. At present, special  
pressure is being put on the  
Zayre chain. A meeting was  
recently held, which did not  
produce a satisfactory  
agreement. A national boycott  
strategy is soon to be announced  
as of this writing. In the  
meantime, be on the lookout  
and be sure to let the store  
managers know how dissatisfied  
you are with their refusal to  
honor the boycott.  

And remember the words of  
Lucy Taylor:  

"It is too late for us that're  
sick. But for the people still  
working in the plants and...  
[those] that’re coming on after  
us, we ask you to help us.”  

Boycott J. P. Stevens.

Tokenism  

Continued from page 6  

with the cure for sexism in the  
institution of the family.  

Tokens keep us from taking  
the leap from reform to  
revolution. Tokens keep us from  
bringing about the essential  
revolution necessary to end  
inequality.  

“Revolution,” according to  
Germaine Greer, “is the festival  
of the oppressed.” Joy and  
celebration would come from  
the struggle with a new sense of  
purpose and integrity.  

“It would be revolution,”  
writes Ms. Greer, “if women  
would suddenly stop loving the  
victors in violent encounters.” It  
would be revolution if we had  
permanent part-time  
opportunities for employment. It  
would be revolution if state  
laws and private customs  
assumed equality in marriage. It  
would be revolution if women as  
a class, all women — mothers,  
wives, nurses, secretaries and  
teachers — would change so  
much that they would long for  
and aspire to equality.  

Revolution, not tokenism, is  
what we could celebrate. Sisters,  
let’s celebrate!
