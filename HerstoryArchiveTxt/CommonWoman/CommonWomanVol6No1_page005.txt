The word is out! And the
word is Feminism. The Feminist
Talks began Sunday, January 10
with a spirit and energy that
bode well for the rest of the
series of Sunday gatherings,
focusing on any and all aspects
of Feminism.

Born out of a collaborative

idea to re-create the mutual
learning, shared information,
and generative support that

seemed so prevalent in the
60's, talks began to take shape
through dozens of conversations
with many different women.
Many women felt the need to
learn more about feminism
hoping to question old assump-
tions, explore current beliefs and
spark new ideas for discussion,
enlightenment, and day-to-day
affirmation. What better
resource than the hearts and
minds of Everywoman in the
greater Burlington area!

Feminist Talks

This Sunday’s meeting was
attended by a colorful represen-
tation of women in our com-
munity — working women,
mothers, engineers, lesbians,
writers; all curious to learn and
willing to share their stances and

questions. The atmosphere of
support and excitement was
palpable. We talked mostly

about what people would like to
see the talks focus on and how
to bring that about.

Some of the potential issues
raised included: simply getting
“up on the times,” where does
feminism start?, who takes
responsibility? — can’t just
blame men; feminism and les-
bianism; the myths and lies
we've grown up with and what
keeps those myths alive; a
validation of both old and new
aspects of feminism; women and
competitiveness; feminism and
men; feminism in the workplace;
women’s spirituality; feminism
and mental health; our struggle
with language; the need for
communication; building new
stories about ourselves; history
of feminism in Burlington...

Some of the suggestions for
structure included: brief presen-
tations followed by discussion;
focus on a topic; share and read
inspirational work and literature.

A good start! The talks will
continue through March and
later if interest continues. All
and every woman are encour-
aged to attend. Hey you shy
sisters — many women were
connecting at Every Woman's
Place for the first time, many
came “just to see” what other
women were talking about.
Your participation, ideas and
spirit are welcome. Please join us
Sundays, 3-5 p.m.

BURLINGTON WOMEN VOTERS: VOTE FOR
THE JOBS WITH PEACE RESOLUTION WHICH
WILL BE ON THE BALLOT MARCH 2ND!!

"Shall the City Council call upon
the President and members of Congress
to make more federal funds available
for local jobs and needs in health,
education and energy, by reducing

spending on nuclear weapons and for-
eign military intervention, and by
negotiating with the U.S.S.R. for
mutual and verifiable cuts in
armaments?"

THE ANSWER IS YES!

Peace
Prize

Burlington — Cristel Holzer,
a German-born woman and
grandmother from Putney, is the
recipient of the 1981 Vermont
Peace Prize. Awarded by the
Vermont chapter of the Physi-
cians for Social Responsibility,
the prize represents that group's
work to stop the proliferation of
nuclear arms and to prevent a
nuclear war.

Mrs. Holzer is a member of
the American Friends Service
Committee, and helped organize
the Washington to Moscow

march in August. Marchers in
the 35-mile walk between the
two Vermont towns called for
an end to the nuclear arms race.

She lived four years under
Hitler in Nazi Germany before
fleeing to the United States
forty years ago.

“All life is precious, we
really have our work cut out for
us," Cristel said as she addressed
the hundreds gathered at the
benefit.

Day Care

By Connie Wilson

If Ethan Allen Child Care
Center does not find a new
home by May, we will be forced
to close. Due to financial prob-
lems in these politically unsup-
portive times, and to the May 31
termination of our lease by
UVM, we must leave our current
location at Fort Ethan Allen in
Winooski. We are now escalating
our already intensive search for a
new site. Without strong com-
munity support in our effort, we
will not survive.

For ten years, Ethan Allen
Child Care Center has provided a
quality child care program for
fifty to seventy children ages
two through six, most of whom
come from lower income, work-
ing families. The State Depart-
ment of Social and Rehabilita-
tion Services refers a great many
“protective service” children to
our center. Our van provides
transportation for them, as well
as for children from families
without cars. Integrating child-
ren with special needs into our
program has been one of our
priorities. With the help of
United Way grants, we have run
a mainstreamed summer camp
and a parent-support program.
Our kitchen provides innovative

and nutritious vegetarian break-

fasts, lunches, and snacks.

Teachers are committed to pro-

viding a developmental curricu-
lum rich in experience and
interpersonal communication.
Our staff functions as a collec-
tive in making decisions for the
center. We have always had
strong ties to the community,
with foster grandparents, college

and high school students, and

vocational rehabilitation volun-
teers supplementing our staff.
We are excited about the possi-
bility of expanding our program
to include infant care and
after-school care if a new facility
permits, as well as sharing the
space with other groups inter-
ested in providing drop-in care
or evening care during concerts.

We have been exploring
different sites since our attempt
to move to Adams School a year
ago. For a while it looked as if
moving to the basement of
Memorial Auditorium in Burling-
ton was a distinct possibility. We
have joined together with other
community groups in a proposal
to convert that space into a
community center. Besides the
daycare center, the new com-
munity center would include
after-school and other youth
programs administered by the
Mayor’s Youth Office, adult day
care by the Visiting Nurses
Association, and community
theater. Although we have the
strong support of the Mayor's
office and several Alderpeople,
the Finance Board has tabled
discussion of the proposal, and
seems to lean towards delaying
the process by turning over the

administration of Memorial
Auditorium to the Department
of Parks and Recreation. We will
not be able to survive such a
delay.

Should our attempts to
move into the Memorial Audi-
torium basement fail, our search
will have to become more
creative and wide-reaching than
ever before. As public schools
face up to their problems with
declining enrollments, for exam-
ple in South Burlington, we are
approaching them about renting
vacant space. With Adams
School still standing vacant a
year after it was bought by a
developer, rental there may also
be a possibility. We are open to
the idea of buying and reno-
vating a private home if we can
find the capital. Any help in the
form of real estate leads or
legwork will be appreciated in
the coming months. Please call
656-2648 or 2678 if you can
help.

What else can you do? Write
to the Board of Aldermen and
women, c/o Bill Blanchard,
President, at City Hall, with
copies to Mayor Sanders.

Express your support for the
concept of a community center
in Burlington in light of current
youth problems and the impact
of federal cuts on children and
elders. Tell them you know of
our plight and would like to see
the city assist us in finding a new
home. Tell them how day care is
important in your own life.
Telephone the alderperson in
your ward with the same
message. Help us get the public
exposure we need and deserve
by writing letters to the editor
of the Burlington Free Press and
Vanguard, and spreading the
word to friends and neighbors.
Feel free to call us at Ethan
Allen Child Care Center if you
have any questions or want an
update. Our search committee
welcomes new members.
