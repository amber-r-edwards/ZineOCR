FEMINIST  
THERAPY  

Continued from 5  

DIAN: And do you think that  
a therapist who is not a feminist  
approaches this matter  
differently?  

DIANE: I'd say that the main  
difference is not taking into  
account that the responsibility is  
not falling solely on an  
individual’s shoulders but that  
there is a structure outside that  
is helping women stay in the  
roles that they’re in. A lot of the  
therapy for years has been  
learning to adjust and accept  
your situation, rather than  
change your situation and make  
it work for you. The thrust for  
me is looking at your situation,  
looking at how you feel about  
yourself, learning how to feel  
more empowered, and then  
making a decision whether you  
want to stay with your situation  
or change it.  

DIAN: So it’s open when you  
begin therapy.  

DIANE: Yes, it's very open. If  
we're working with a couple, the  
presentation is that we're not  
encouraging you to stay as a  
couple or not stay as a couple,  
that we are looking at what will  
make you feel best about  
yourself as an individual in this  
society.  

DIAN: Rather than making  
adjustment to the situation the  
be all and end all? You're saying  
that you can choose to adjust or  
you can choose to not adjust  
and go into something else.  

DIANE: Yes  

DIAN: I'm wondering how  
dance therapy or movement  
therapy fits in here?

EDIE: I address these issues,  
also. What I like best, though, is  
addressing these issues with the  
body. I feel best when I help  
both women and men get in  
touch with the power of their  
bodies. If people can own, and  
understand, and become aware  
of the power that they have in  
their bodies, people can then  
understand that they have power  
within their bodies to shape  
their lives.  

DIAN: Do you find that  
women are less in touch with  
their bodies than men?  

EDIE: Overall, no, I wouldn’t  
say that. Most of the people I  
see are in general scared of their  
bodies first of all, but after that  
I think women are more open to  
their bodies than the men I see.  
In the beginning, though, both  
women and men are pretty  
scared of admitting that their  
bodies are a source of power. In  
terms of society, power has been  
pretty much “out there” — it’s  
money, it’s what your name is,  
it’s what your belongings look  
like, it's all those things “out  
there.” What I think is the real  

power is understanding the  
power inside and how that  
relates to what's out there. You  
have to deal with the power  
outside, but people come in here  
who have all that supposed  
power outside and still feel  
powerless inside.  

DIAN: Well, what kind of  
power do you have in your own  
body?

EDIE: You have power in  
terms of choices. You have the  
choice inside to be healthy or  
unhealthy, you have the power  
to pay attention to your body or  
the power not to, you have the  
power to feel good or not to feel  
good. I think a way right now  
that people deny their powers is  
all the sicknesses, all the cancers  
— this is giving power to  
illnesses, giving power to  
constricting. Our minds are in  
our bodies, our consciousness is  
in our bodies. It’s scary, because  
it’s very powerful to own your  
body, because you realize that  
you really have a lot of control.  
One reason some people don’t  
want to own their power is that  
when you become powerful you  
become responsible for your  
power.  

One of the things we do here  
is how to be powerful and ask  
for support, because often in the  
past when people have been  
powerful they have been isolated  
and haven’t thought that they  
could be powerful and still have  
needs, still have wants.  

DIANE: I’ve always had  
trouble labeling issues as being  
masculine or feminine, because I  
think that they’ve been so  
labeled or mislabelled in the  
past that it’s real hard for me to  
know which is which. I think in  
some ways that feminist issues  
are issues which women are  
choosing to work on, to  
re-examine, to struggle with and  
then to come out with different  
ideas and different feelings. So  
at this point, for me, pretty  
much anything is a feminist  
issue.  

DIAN: Does re-examining  
issues mean looking at them in  
the light of your individual  
choices rather than in the light  
of the role you've been given?  

DIANE: Yes, and it also  
means looking at the structure  
and how the structure has  
fostered certain roles and  
re-examining means asking if this  
is the role we choose to play in  
this society and if it is, then  
that's O.K., but it’s re-looking at  
those roles. I share my values  
with people in therapy, but I  
will not force those values down  
people's throats, I will not tell  
them that this is the only way of  
life, or that this is the “right”  
way. Here, we share our own  
values but we encourage people  
to make their own choices.  

DIAN: Diane, you're married  
and have a child. If you had a  
lesbian client who had no desire  
to be married and perhaps no  
desire to have a child, you  
wouldn’t be asking her to  
conform to your way of life?  

DIANE: The basic issues of  
what makes a relationship, what  
makes a couple, are the same,  
whether it’s a heterosexual  
couple or a lesbian couple.  
You're still dealing with who's in  
control, who feels good, who's  
making decisions. And I’ve never  
seen a couple where roles  
weren't being played to some  
extent, though they may not be  
the traditional “masculine” and  
“feminine” roles.  

DIANE: Anyone who comes  
to me, including lesbians, knows  
I'm married, knows I have a  
child. They also know I don’t  
care either way, that that’s their  
choice — it’s O.K. to live a life as  
a lesbian, and it’s O.K. to live as  
a heterosexual. If someone feels  
good about the choices they're  
making and it's not directly  
hurting somebody, then that’s  
great.
