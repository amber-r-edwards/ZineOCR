CELEBRATIONS

The Muse and the Earth Mother

By Amy Richardson

I am 30 years old, a full-time
housewife and mother, and a
part-time puppeteer. In my
puppeteer persona, I perform
with the Wild Onion Spirit
Theatre, which my first partner
and I began about a year ago.
For me, the puppet theatre is an
exciting and limitless art form: I
want our stories to entertain, to
be beautiful and powerful on
many levels, to provide a visual
experience out of the ordinary; I
want to spark people’s
imaginations and make them
laugh.

Not too long ago, I was afraid
even to begin with this work.
And, though I’m getting braver
and more confident all the time,
I'm still afraid, to some extent,
when I try something new with
the theatre.

In a sense, I’m newborn,
because I repressed my artistic
side for years, as I struggled to
excel as a mother and housewife.
I felt that motherhood was a
sacred state, and I really felt
strongly the power vested in me
through my giving and nurturing
life. The honor of being a sister
to Mother Earth helped me
make it through the diapers,
illnesses, noise, and untidiness of
four babies. It became evident to
me, however, that parenthood
and house and family
management are extremely
complex jobs, requiring a vaster
array of skills and strengths than
I had ever dreamed existed.

I felt I could never be good
enough at this multifaceted job
to be able to allow myself the
luxury of impractical play. I felt
that everything I did had to have
a purpose directly related to the
needs of my family — so I put a
lot of energy into clothes and
toy making, quilting and
cooking. I just couldn't allow
my artistic side to express itself
with no strings attached. I hoped
that this kind of control would
keep my identity as a wife and
mother intact; it was hard
enough trying to make the
transition from carefree
schoolgirl to selfless mother,
without having other identities
suggest themselves as well. I was
inwardly divided by this conflict
between my artistic and mother
selves and attempted to reject
the former. I wondered
sometimes if that part of me was
real after all; had it ever really
existed?

Not everyone wants to
express themselves artistically,
and I wouldn’t expose myself in

this verbose manner if I didn't
think that my experiences apply
to many people. I believe that
everyone has aspects of
personality which correspond to
those I have labeled “The Muse”
and “The Earthmother.”
Interpret the Earthmother as the
societal, responsible, animal self,
and the Muse as the dreamy,
more spiritual, private self.

These two have been known to
meet often for brief trysts, but
they rarely succeed in becoming
one.

I don’t really know what gave
me the first push toward
acceptance of my Muse. It
happened all of a sudden (or so
it seemed) when I was pregnant
with my fourth child. Maybe it
was a feeling of “now or never,”
or perhaps part of a natural
psychic cycle (a nice ride but no
handlebars). Whatever it was, it
was as undeniable as the urge to
“push” when having a baby.

Air is free and poetry and ideas

are flowing with the energy of being.

Bodies are dancing in tune with the earth.

The sun and the stars speak in tongue and totality.

I felt the urge, but I was
scared. I was afraid I couldn't do
it, that that part of me had died,
that my home life would become
impossibly chaotic if I tried.
Perhaps I would love it too
much and forget everything else!

I needed, and received, a lot
of help from my husband,
friends, and family — 
reassurance and encouragement,

babysitting and ironing. My life
did become more chaotic at
first, and sometimes I do get
preoccupied with puppets, and
forget to take care of some of
my more tedious chores when
they first cry out for attention.
(My laundry gets inconsolable.)
I’ve never been a great housewife
and, just when I thought I was
beginning to learn how to do it,
it's more of a struggle than ever.
And I have to constantly work
to try to keep abreast of my
family’s ups and downs: I'm

trying to be aware of each
person’s needs so that I won’t be
a bad mother or distant wife,
and I am both at times.

On top of trying to keep up
with house and family, I'm
trying hard to keep all of my
jobs from exerting so much
simultaneous pressure that I can
no longer cope at all. I don’t
want to lose my marbles. I’ve

got to proceed at my own pace,
attempting to strike a balance
between my two worlds. It’s not
easy. Sometimes the Muse gets
stepped on a lot, or gets in the
way of my family concerns, and
I wonder why I ever got involved
in all this stuff.

I do know, however, that I
can’t get the Muse back into its
room in the tower — now that it
has been let out, it has become
bold, demanding and exuberant
like my children. I guess I'll just
have to accept it and try to
become a whole person.

But then my mother died
when I was 14, and from then
on Christmas has been really
awful, because my family
doesn’t deal with things, so no
one ever said, “This isn’t really
like a family anymore, so why
don’t we stop playing the game
of trying to be merry and jolly.”

I just feel like it’s such a
hypocritical thing — it’s not
joyous at all and everyone’s

really feeling the change that’s
happened in our house since my
mother died. My sister and I
started making the cookies and
trying to do all the things my
mother had done, but it just
wasn't the same. We have a little
sister who was about four when
my mother died, so we wanted
to make Christmas happy for
her. So up until last year I did
that. Last year I just couldn’t
bring myself to go home.

About three years ago when
my little sister was about 10, we
went through all the rigamarole

of Christmas morning, laughing
and smiling and opening
presents, and then I went up to
my little sister’s room and she
was crying and she said,
“Daddy's drunk and he’s so sad
and he’s not saying it and I just
know he feels terrible.” I
couldn’t believe the things she
was feeling. She was willing to
go along with all the smiles and
stuff publicly, but inside her
heart was breaking.

It just seems to me that
because my mother’s death was
never recognized, it was always
ignored and sort of pushed
under the carpet, that you can’t
make changes on top of things
you haven't recognized.

So last year I decided I wasn't
going to go home and I would
make my own Christmas. I was
visiting a friend in Boston and
we were going to have
Christmas. And it turned out the
same way; it was really forced.
We went through the motions,
visited people, made a dinner,
went to Quaker meeting, did
different things like that, and it
felt like “Well, we did it, but so
what?”

So this year I've really learned
my lesson and I’m not going to
do anything around it. It’s just
not worth it; I mean it’s too
much of an emotional strain and
you don’t get anything from it.

DIAN: I think that Christmas
is a mixture of very good times
and very good memories and
very bad times and very bad
memories. And no matter how
good Christmas is I don’t think
it can ever be as good as you
think it should be. It can never
be as good as it was in the
movies you saw as a child or as it
was in the books you read. The
image of Christmas is that it
should be a time of utter
fulfillment, utter peace, great
harmony and merriment.

CAROL: Just like marriage.

DIAN: Yes! It’s not humanly
possible for anything to be that
good and so you get

disappointed.

The moon is as strong as the sun.
The sky is as active as the earth.
The dance of words and art spin in the world of life.
God is grateful and not dead.
The devil has left town.
