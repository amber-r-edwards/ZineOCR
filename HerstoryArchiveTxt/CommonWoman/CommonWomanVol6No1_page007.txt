Anarcha-Feminism  

By Laurie Larson  

In eighth grade, Carl Ander-  
son taught me to abhor ‘1st’  
and ‘2nd person’ when doing  
article-writing. I now use it as a  
matter of principle. This is called  
ignoring authority. One problem  
that political treatises seem to  
have is being rhetoric-ridden. I’m  
going to write this somewhere  
between prose-poetry and per-  
sonal manifesto (the only kind  
of manifesto I'll take seriously).  

I’m an anarchist. Anarcha-  
feminist. As much as I hate  
labels and find their usefulness  
extremely limited, that means  
something to me. So I ask  
myself, what might it mean to  
you?  

“Ah! She's a terrorist!”  
Well, I admit, I can look pretty  
scary sometimes when I wake up  
from a nightmare (or face the  
surreal reality of living every  
day), when I get dressed for  
street-theatre, Halloween or an  
action. But physically or violent-  
ly, I pose little threat to any-  
thing living. Living is a key  
word. I do not believe that  
cutting down a fence at a nuclear  
power plant is violence; I do  
believe that what it tries to do to  
me (and succeeds) is violence.  

Active self-defense. No  
“passive”-ism. Hammering/  
destroying the nosecones of  

nuclear warheads is great. A bit  
of spray-paint on a bank to  
educate people as to its connec-  
tions in S. Africa is fine. Non-  
violent direct action. Creativity  

Radical Feminism  

(EXCERPTS FROM THE  
RADICAL FEMINIST  
ORGANIZING  
COMMITTEE  
STATEMENTS)  

...‘We are radical feminists  
who have come together as a  
result of an article by Brooke,  
“The State of Feminism,” in the  
February 1980 issue of Off Our  
Backs. We want to establish a  
national network of radical  
feminists to provide a forum for  
exchanging ideas, analyzing the  
conditions of women, and  
developing strategies for change.  
Our common concerns are that  
the main goal of feminism is to  
end male domination and that  
radical feminism must be a  
political movement with a radi-  
cal feminist political ideology  
being the only criterion for  
membership in the network —  
that is, not sexual orientation,  
type of job, etc.)  

"We think a national  
feminist network and organiza-  
tion is necessary to connect,  
locally isolated radical feminists  
with others; therefore to know  
that there are others like us  
(thus boost our morale), to  
facilitate an exchange of ideas  
and radical feminist activities.  
Radical feminism has always  
been organizationally weak. It  
fell apart and/or was taken over  
because there were no national,  
or even local, general radical  
feminist organizations outside  
New York City even at the  
height of the Women’s Libera-  
tion Movement. The history  
of radical feminism and of the  
Women’s Liberation Movement  
in general is a testament to the  
perils of confining ourselves to  
purely local ongoing activity. We  
need to transcend (though not  
utterly repudiate) small groups,  
“structurelessness,” etc.  
Organizing on a national scale  
demands different work styles  
and structures from the local  
work to which WLM activities  
are accustomed.”  

“We urge you to begin to  
build local groups to affiliate  
with RFOC — if you agree with  
our views — to carry out analysis  
and action, and to help with  
other RFOC work, as well as to  
link up. To repeat our two  
immovable points: RFOC's, and  
radical feminism’s, purpose is to  
end male supremacy; we oppose,  
and will not affiliate with,  
heterosexual chauvinists and les-  
bian chauvinists. Groups are  
beginning to form in New  
Jersey, Madison, WI, Durham-  
Chapel Hill, N.C., and Eugene,  
Oregon.  

You can receive the RFOC  
newsletter, “Feminism Lives!”  
by sending a couple of dollars  
donation (they really need it —  
more if you can) and remain on  
the mailing list by contributing  
articles, political statements,  
thoughts, etc... “RFOC is at the  

point where we must not merely  
continue a holding pattern, but  
forge ahead. The ERA’s crisis is  
a point of historical crunch for  
modern feminism. When the  
reformists fail, radical feminists  
must be there for women (and  
whether the ERA wins or loses,  
the reformers will fail — women  
will gain little in practice even  
with the ERA, because the basic  
power relations (between  
women and men) will remain.) If  
radical feminists’ historic respon-  
sibility is to lead the movement,  
we have to know where we're  
going and what we’re going to  
do to get there.”  

The Radical Feminist  
Organizing Committee’s address  
is: 109 Ellerbee St., Durham,  
N.C. 27704. Back issues of  
“Feminism Lives!” are avail-  
able for $1 each,  

for a “dictatorship of the prole-  
tariat” and an ensuing withering-  
away of the state, anarchists  
believe that means create ends,  
and being feminists, we focus on  
process.  

2) Belief in both diversity  
and unity. Nature is again the  
best example of this I see. The  
society that we are currently  
crippled by keeps simplifying  
the natural environment  
(although they make things  
more complicated, they destroy  
the balanced complexity of what  
was there), and at the same time  
isolates individuals rather than  
fostering cooperative or collec-  
tive living. As Audre Lorde  
writes:  

“As women we have been taught  
to either ignore our differences  
or to view them as causes for  
separation rather than as forces  
for change. Without community,  
there is no liberation, only the  
most vulnerable and temporary  
armistice between an individual  
and her oppression.”  

As each individual learns to revel  
in her differences, special flavor  
and style, she also learns aware-  
ness of other kinds of people  
and takes on responsibility for  
more than just herself by em-  
bracing the principle of freedom  
for everyone, rather than just  
fighting/competing for some  
kind of narcissistic ego-gratifica-  
tion. Integrity is understood  
when a person's mind can open  
and support is offered freely.  

3) Belief in both spontaneity  
and organization. (I have  
already discussed this briefly.)  

I don’t propagandize to give  
a “correct line” on things or to  
“educate the masses,” but to  
stimulate thoughtful dialogue,  
and catalyze the sharing of  
information by individuals. I  
sometimes worry that the people  
who see themselves as defining  
what is “radical” today continue  
the labeling of people along  
superficial lines (class analysis),  
who separate process from goals  
(advocate replacing one State  
with another), and who focus on  
workers as being the only  
possible revolutionary force (as  
they make car, house, and  
insurance payments faithfully,  
work in factories that have  
nuclear “defense” contracts, pay  
taxes to an Imperialist State,  
drink beer and go bowling to  
foster revolutionary comra-  
derie). These groups continue  
the marketization of our society  
by commoditizing all  
relationships and seeing every-  
thing in quantified terms. They  
rally for “fair wages” and  
never question how unsatisfying  
and possibly destructive the  
work is that they do; the nature  
of work for production’s sake.  
They want to change the posi-  

social  

tions of power and authority,  
not destroy them. They want to  
change material relationships,  
not social ones.  
At the same time I feel  

relieved that at most women’s  
gatherings I've been at, women  
for the most part ignore and/or  
challenge the Marxist presence.  
Women who know the impor-  
tance of social interactions, who  
always stress revolution as pro-  
cess, who are experienced at  
mixing love with rage, indivi-  
duality with cooperation, who  
ignore authority and foster their  
own decentralist ways of organ-  
izing, who are creative and  
colorful and know best how to  
deal with fear, pain and oppres-  
sion against impossible odds in  
order to survive and grow strong;  
women like these, rich with the  
essence of life, don’t often look  
to a visionless, regimented peo-  
ple for a map of how the revolu-  
tion should go. As Amy Horo-  
witz says, “Feminism facilitates,  
indeed creates, anarchism.”  

A woman said to me on the  
bus going to the Women's  
Pentagon Action, “We are freer  
in this country than in most  
other countries.” This kind of  
political naivete disturbs me, as  
does speaking of “relative” free-  
dom. We live in the most imper-  
ialistic country anywhere, and it  
seems more insidious to me that  
the U.S. can maintain passivity  
so effectively by using classic  
Orwellian doublespeak, and by  
keeping oppressed individuals  
and groups isolated and con-  
tented with believing that they  
have a chance to change their  
own positions through protec-  
tive legislation and the work  
ethic. People actually adopt  
doublethink as reason, and claim  
vacuous liberalisms to be true  
resistance to this pacification  
processing. People are so  
absorbed with “having” that  

they forget the quality of life  
issues of “doing” and “being.”  
Mitsuye Yamada offers this  
insight into American freedom:  
“I had assumed I was more or  
less free, not realizing that those  
who are free make and take  
choices; they do not choose  
from options proffered by ‘those  
out there’.”  

This analysis may seem  
elitist since our struggles seem so  
small compared to those happen-  
ing in Third World countries  
today. What we sometimes for-  
get is that our blatant atrocities  
are more easily ignored by the  
mass media (and seem less  
atrocious to a numbed society,  
spoon-fed violence on T.V.). We  
also tend to ignore many  
oppressed people because of  
their so-called privilege, and see
