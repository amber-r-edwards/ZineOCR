Women

By Carol Cohen

Plans are now being made
for one of the largest feminist
conferences in Vermont. On
May 12th and 13th, the Cream-
ery Education Foundation will
sponsor the second annual
WomenWomenWomen — Confer-
ence, and there are going to be
some significant changes from
last year. It appears that the
Creamery is attempting to be
more accountable for their
money this year. Last year they
had no formalized budget. This
year they have formed a budget
committee to come up with firm
figures to be published in local
papers.

Last year, $4,215 was spent
on bringing Margie Adam, Phy-
lis Chessler, and Rita Mae
Brown to the conference. This
year $4,300 is being spent on
bringing Betty Friedan and
Sweet Honey in the Rock. Last
year, workshop leaders were not
paid. This year they are being

W.A.R.

offered $20 for each workshop
or a complimentary ticket for a
friend (this year, as well as last,
workshop leaders are admitted
free). Last year there was no
definite sliding scale policy on
ticket price. This year people
whose incomes are $8,000 and
above pay full price ($20,
$10/day), and those whose
incomes are below that figure
will pay $10, or $5 a day. This
year $1,400 raised during a
“jogathon” last fall will go
towards the free admission of
people on welfare, in jail, on
unemployment, etc., actively
recruited by the newly formed
outreach committee, who will be
contacting local agencies in
person or by phone. Hannah
Dennison’s salary (the only
woman on the planning commit-
tee officially being paid for her
work on the committee) went
up this year from $2,590 to
$3,200.

Revived

By Lynn Vera

The all day training session
for Women Against Rape on
Saturday, Feb. 3, was exciting,
very worthwhile, and definitely
encouraging.

Any womyn who have ever
worked with WAR and other
womyn who feel an investment
in and connection to this organi-
zation can enjoy the relieving
news that WAR is absolutely
alive and strong again. Twenty
or so womyn attended and
contributed to the training ses-
sion: womyn from differing
lifestyles, ages, political perspec-
tives. As the day progressed I
saw, through what I guess should
be called hindsight, flashes of
Process-to-come for these wo-
myn... unavoidable and often
difficult discussions about
action, image, racism, classism,
power dynamics, radical politics
and/or lifestyle, etc. Yet I also
felt a calm sense of trust in the
strength of all these “new”
womyn (most of whom I didn’t
know), and even sparks of
excitement, for I remember with
respect and appreciation how
valuable, though often draining,
the group process in WAR was
for me. In fact, by the end of
the day there was already a
feeling of connectedness among
people in the room and the
energy felt very high, charged.

During the criticism/self-
criticism (feedback) circle at the
end of the day, I looked from
face to face, listened, and felt
again the power of a group of
womyn talking honestly

(womyn who had become trust-
ing and vulnerable so quickly
with each other) and working
together; parts of me really
envied the experience beginning
for these sisters... a new collect-
ive, a new connection, the
stimulating work and personal
process ahead. But I didn’t
romanticize it totally, and the
other parts of me remembered
that my commitment was to
help facilitate the training
session, and not to jump into
WAR again.

Anyway... I heard that 15
womyn attended the first meet-
ing (coincidentally chosen to be
on Monday nights... WAR has
met on Monday nights since its
beginning, nearly five years ago).
They are currently working on a
grant proposal, seeking funds
(anyone have money to contri-
bute? Box 92, Burlington) and
continuing training. Working
relations have been nurtured
with Stephanie Schoggen of the
Burlington Police Department,
who attended the training
session along with Susan Via of
the State’s Attorney's office.
Both of these
sensitive and politically aware
concerning the issue of rape, and
I’m glad they are anxious to
work with WAR (not as mem-
bers).

I celebrate this community
of womyn and feel respectful of
all of our work. WAR feels like
an integral part of the growing
awareness of womonstrength,
womonanger and womonsupport

womyn are

reser mw

Based on a telephone inter-
view I had with Hannah, she said
she was being paid to be the
conference co-ordinator, which
means she is hired to keep tabs
on decisions made by the group,
facilitate planning meetings, set
the meeting agenda and decide
priorities, and involve herself in
public relations. I also asked
Hannah what process the Cream-
ery uses to form the planning
committee. She said that some
people have asked to serve on
the committee, some people
were invited because Hannah
and others suspected that person
might be interested and effect-
ive, some were invited due to
their “expertise” in a particular
area, and this year those who
served on last year’s committee
were asked back. Hannah also
said she would like this year’s
committee to come up with a
more structured process for
determining who serves on the
committee.

I also asked Hannah what
progress was being made in her
efforts to contact Betty Friedan
to find out her views on Lesbian-
ism, since Betty has a history of
trying to keep the gay issue out
of the Women’s Movement.
Hannah said that so far she has
reached one of Betty's adminis-
trators who has assured her that
Betty is not anti-Lesbian and
would endorse a statement to
that effect.

(Ed. note: Carol Cohen is a
member of this year’s planning
committee.)

in the Burlington area; I am both
relieved and excited that there is
a group of womyn who have
joined to continue this essential
and varied work.

I want to express respect
and appreciation for the small
group of womyn who really
overextended themselves to keep
WAR functioning for a number
of months, and to all of the new
members of WAR, in whom I
feel trust. It is a good way to
grow, I think, when an organi-
zation can be extended to so
many new people, with help and
encouragement and without a
lot of conditions or expecta-
tions.

So, Women Against Rape is
alive and well and still staffing a
24-hour hotline (863-1236).
Send encouragement, ideas,
money, etc. to Women Against
Rape, Box 92, Burlington, Vt.

Update

By Doreen Kraft

Kristina Berster’s federal
trial in Burlington is now over.
From one point of view, this is a
small victory. The tide was
turned in her favor by the
combined efforts of her defense
team, local Vermont community
members, and others across the
U.S.

Although her trial is over,
her legal battles have barely
begun. Her release from jail
depends on the willingness of
the Immigration and Naturaliza-
tion Service to set a reasonable
bail. Kristina faces extradition
and/or deportation. These pro-
ceedings could take two to three
years. The cases will require
experts: four to five translators
of German legal doctrine and
law, German witnesses to testify
at the immigration hearings, a
German lawyer, and several
more legal researchers for a
complex appeals case. This case
has been widely publicized and
will be watched carefully
because the U.S. must decide if
it will give political asylum to a
woman whose native land is a
U.S. ally. A number of impor-

GOV'T TO HIRE ANTI—ABORTIONIST?

The Burlington Free Press,
in an AP article, related that a
new program which is supposed
to counsel pregnant teenagers
“on all options regarding their
pregnancy” is trying to hire the
president of a national anti-abor-
tion group as a consultant. Lulu
Mae Nix, head of the adolescent
pregnancy office, said they
wanted to hire Marjory Mecklen-
burg, president of American
Citizens Concerned for Life,
Inc., “because she is very good
in the area of community
development and mobilizing
resources.” This teenage preg-
nancy program was funded by
money slashed from Carter’s
budget for birth control clinics
and contraceptive research.

tant legal precedents will be set.

The defense committee in
Burlington has a core of 12
people. We meet regularly, and
our work consists of fund-
raising, legal research, and public
education about both the case
and the repressive conditions in
West Germany. We are presently
seeking community groups (i.e.
political, feminist, health) to
write to us for material and act
as resource and sharing centers
in their areas. It is important
that everyone be aware of
Kristina’s plight and the forces
that victimized her. Only if the
people put pressure on the
government can we hope to stop
her extradition and/or deporta-
tion and prevent the erosion of
our own civil liberties and basic
human rights.
