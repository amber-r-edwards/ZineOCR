POLITICUS

Welcome Back

Caucus

By Pamela J. Greene

For the past two months,  
women from around the state  
have been meeting in Montpelier  
to reorganize the Vermont Wo-  
men’s Political Caucus. This  
non-partisan group seeks equal  
representation and participation  
for women in local, state, and  
national government. The newly  
organized Vermont chapter is  
one of 200 local caucuses in 50  
states.

The statement of purpose  
for the Vermont Women’s Political  
Caucus is “to assure to all  
women of the State of Vermont,  
citizenship and full and equal  
participation in the political  
process; to gain political power  
and achieve and maintain our  
rights.” In the future, candidates  
will be endorsed and assisted by  
the Caucus if they are committed  
to working for women’s  
rights once elected. The Caucus  
hopes to provide practical support  
to qualified women running  
for elected and appointed posi-  
tions around the state.

Women represent 41.6% of  
the workforce in Vermont, and  
this does not count women who  
work within the home. Yet  
women hold only 10% of the  
State Senate seats and 20% of  
the House seats. These percen-  
tages were the same 25 years  
ago!

At a recent Caucus meeting,  
members targeted the Vermont  
State Senate as being a most  
offensive body to women. In the  
last two weeks of this legislative  
session, funding for Planned  
Parenthood was retained only  
after Lieutenant Governor Made-  
leine Kunin cast a tie-breaking  
vote in favor of Planned Parent-  
hood. Many Caucus members  
felt that this was a good example  
of how one woman in a position  
of power can make a real differ-  
ence to the lives of all women.

During the summer, mem-  
bers of the Caucus’ Steering  
Committee plan to travel to the  
four corners of the state talking  
about the Caucus and its goals.  
In the fall, there will be an  
annual meeting with a speaker  
from the National Women’s  
Political Caucus. This month, at  
the “WomenWomenWomen  
Two” conference, the Caucus  
will hold a workshop and have a  
booth with information.

The next meeting of the  
Vermont Women’s Political Cau-  
cus is Thursday, May 10, at 7:30  
p.m. in the basement of the  
Vermont Federal Bank in Mont-  
pelier. For more information,  
contact Daphne Gratiot, Caucus  
chair, Otis Hill Farm, Wood-  
stock, Vt. 05091, 457-1088. The  
Burlington local contact is  
Lynda Barney, 864-4922.

en. Sunday afternoon softball  
has been a Lesbian tradition for  
many summers. There is a  
Sagaris (symbol of the Goddess)  
basketball team for the past few  
years, sometimes playing with  
the women in the Correctional  
Center. Women are getting  
stronger everywhere: running,  
bicycling, learning Karate or Tai  
Chi. Intellectual muscle building  
has also been taking place in  
study groups formed around the  
topics of Feminism, Anarchy,  
Socialism and Gyn/Ecology to  
name a few.

In the past few years  
women have also taken to the  
streets in marches to show  
solidarity on International Wom-  
en’s Day. We have had a Take-  
Back-the-Night March in con-  
junction with the national  
march; held a pro-abortion rally  
last spring in City Hall Park after  
the fire-bombing of the Health  
Center. The Burlington Women’s  
Movement was a well-received  
presence in the bicentennial  
Fourth of July parade in this  
city.

Still this does not give a  
picture of the Women’s Move-  
ment. It does not show all of the  
ways we meet: the individual  
contacts, the arguments at the  
workplace, women becoming  
professionals and using their  
skills for women, leaving oppres-  
sive marriages to live their  
own lives, raising non-sexist  
children, new knowledge around  
healing that we are sharing,  
massage workshops, sharing of  
daily life in new ways and  
sharing of property against all  
conditioning.

Vermont women have creat-  
ed a movement in touch with  
the International Women’s  
Movement and uniquely their  
own. What characterizes that  
movement here is a unity in  
diversity. Perhaps because we are  
comparatively small, we must  
iron out differences and come  
together. If that is a limit, it is at  
the same time an opportunity  
that has given us a rich and  
varied movement.

It may be true that the  
word “Feminist” is a label, and  
that many women claim they do  
not want to be boxed in or  
categorized. On the contrary,  
instead of feeling boxed in,  
many of us have found that we  
have been able to climb out of  
the box of the “feminine role” —  
out from under the expecta-  
tions of how a woman should  
behave in our society. Labels are  
words, and words can have a  
tremendous bonding effect.  
When we are able to look each  
other in the eye, when we  
recognize that we are mutually  
taking the risk of calling our-  
selves Feminists, the excitement  
and energy that result from such  
contact far outweighs the aliena-  
tion we may feel from others  
who do not support Feminist  
politics. More people have to be  
willing to use the label so that  
women can make themselves felt  
as a voting bloc for those who  
still want to use the system to  
make changes, and as a power in  
the community for those women  
who prefer to take to the streets.

Daly

(Continued from Page 3)

The rage and the energy  
between the women was build-  
ing. Mary Daly walked to the  
podium in a cowboy hat and a  
tee-shirt with a “tion(ess?)” im-  
printed on the front. She talked  
about fire and the words related  
to fire and the fire in women  
that inflames and infuriates us  
so that we blaze like a furnace  
and become Furies. Then Daly  
brought on her entourage of  
Furies from her classes to  
demonstrate the sound and  
actions of the Furies. At times  
this escapade seemed as though  
it was right out of a cartoon and  
not to be taken seriously —  
it was just a bunch of young  
college girls who have a crush on  
a charismatic professor.

Perhaps it was more. Why  
shouldn't these women be taken  
seriously in their expression of  
feminism? Quite frankly, I  
thought it was great! If only  
more undergraduate women  
were taken seriously even in  
their “youthful silliness.”

The finale was four songs  
sung by Willie Tyson and Susan  
Abod. It seemed to me that the  
somewhat subtle academic ener-  
gy was lifted at this point —  
poetry and music take us to  
another place, an ecstatic plane.  
Four songs is not enough to  
blow the roof off Morris Audi-  
torium on the Boston University  
campus, so when I left I felt an  
unfulfilled void. I wanted a  
clearer connection to the women  
who attended the event. I was  
not up for a four-hour drive  
home.

The drive home was at times  
a struggle to stay awake, but  
creative energy remained, how-  
ever subtle it seemed. I had time  
to rethink my ideas about Daly's  
latest book, Gyn/Ecology.  
Several things became very clear  
to me. Connections — the book  
is revolutionary because it connects  
all those “no comments” and  
“clicks” and intuitions that we  
have had about patriarchy in the  
herstory of the second wave of  
feminism. It connects women in  
a new time/space. It connects  
the second wave to the first  
wave. And these connections  
mean that ultimately we must  
see feminism as a global/interna-  
tional movement — that as  
women we have no nation, no  
class but ourselves. Nations and  
classes are given to us through  
our associations with men.

Second — ethics and judg-  
ment. Feminism is an ethic  
which is life affirming. As  
feminists we should not shy  
away from the power of ethics.  
Rather we should revel in that  
power — a power which is  
frightening because it implies  
pain and a letting go of our old  
habits and ideas. Feminist ethics  
is a process of connection that  
can often cut to the quick.

And last we must go to the  
root of things in order to build  
the future. Radical (which  
means to go to the root) femin-  
ists cannot ignore our past  
Crone-ology nor our mythic  
reality. We must reclaim those  
roots and the many misnomers  
of patriarchy. We must hear  
ourselves and we must hear  
those roots as they delve deeply  
into us.
