MONEY @
MUSIC

Dear Commonwoman and All,

In June, 1978, Witch 1
played music at a dance at the
Central Vermont Women's Cen-
ter in Montpelier. There was no
doorwoman and when a hat was
passed for the band, we went
home with $8 apiece.

This April 14 we again
played a dance there. This time
the agreement was to charge $2
at the door; one of which went
to the women’s center and the
other to the band: four musi-
cians and a sound engineer. We
received $12 each.

During the first set, Witch 1
was noticing women entering
without paying or giving change
or a dollar. We, as well as most
of the women attending, are low
and even no income individuals.
At the break, Kathleen and Mica
spoke with a doorwoman ex-
plaining what our playing there
entailed: an hour to load equip-
ment, an hour to drive to
Montpelier, two hours to unload
and set up; four hours of playing
music; an hour to break down
and load, an hour to drive home,
an hour to unload and store
equipment. That's 5½ Witch 1
woman-hours! We used three
vehicles. Rehearsal time is
between 20 and 40 hours per
week.

We are very upset about this
second experience in Montpelier.
We feel ripped off and not taken
seriously as working women
musicians. If we are ever to play
there again we will require a
contract and payment in
advance. We did this dance in
part as a benefit and didn't
expect our usual fee but $60 is
unacceptable. Debbie Venn
requested to do this dance to
connect with the Montpelier
women’s community. The wom-
en’s center had the dance to
raise money to pay the rent on
their space. There is something
wrong in a community of
women who are insensitive or
unwilling to be more responsive
around the practical monetary
needs of their own space or
other women workers. $2 is a lot
of money when one is unem-
ployed, but even movies now
cost $3.50—and to go out for a
beer means spending at least two
or three dollars.

We write this letter to let
people know what energy goes
into performing/sharing our
music with them. We would like
to have this work provide us
with a living wage, not $1 per
hour. We sincerely hope this
criticism is understood and
accepted with future faith in
each other’s endeavors.

We would like to acknow-
ledge and greatly appreciate the
financial and enthusiastic
support we have received.

In sisterhood,

Witch 1

Dear Commonwomyn in the
Burlington Womyn’s Commun-
ity,

I want to share some
thoughts and reactions to/from
the womyn/womyn/womyn con-
ference, and to some of the ways
we feel with each other. I feel as
Alix Dobkin, lesbian musician,
once said: We ain’t got it easy,
but we got it!

Let me first address the
conference as a whole. I won't
deny that the conference was
exciting for me, as it was for
many other lesbians and straight
womyn there. It was very
exciting. But for many of the
lesbians there, it was also irrita-
ting. It was exciting because we
seized and created the excite-
ment for ourselves, in spite of
negative lesbian sentiment.
(There was dyke energy in the
conference core group. Some
was dyke-affirming energy.
Some of it was middle-class,
issue avoidant.) True, the con-
ference was not billed as one for
us — a careful ass-covering
technicality on the part of some
of the planners. My objection
comes from a recurrent, persis-
tent irritation with the discre-
pancy of how much work in the
womyn’s movement and energy
in the womyn’s community is
from lesbians — poor lesbians —
radical lesbians — and that fact is
toned down, denied, denounced.
Those bra-burners that were put
down in the conference radio
ads are me and my friends,
the womyn with “contagious
high energy” at the final celebra-
tion. If Ames Curtis disclaims
me — a bra-burner — and disso-
ciates herself from me one day,
then when she uses my “con-
tagious high energy,” she is
stealing from me. I felt personal-
ly stolen from.

I want to focus on my
support group; the womyn’s
community. Our highs are cer-
tainly real. One high, for some
of us, was the spontaneous
dancing at the final gathering,
referred to in the Vanguard as ‘a
group of 100 women linking
arms (whose) contagious high
energy spread..." Those 100
womyn, by the way — oh, how
did that fact get overlooked — or
was it a fact just not worth
mentioning in the press — were
mostly lesbians.

Our high energy gets me
through the days. I also contri-
bute to that high energy. I want
to address now, though, a part
that goes slower, that doesn't
glitter, that is just as real, the
part in each of us that is scared
and alone. I don’t want to dwell
on it, or to give any more focus
and energy to a hard part than
seems necessary; I don’t want to
give anyone — or ourselves —
fuel for labeling us as weak or
unstable. But acknowledgment
of the hard parts is a strengthen-
ing process. If we share, we
don’t feel alone in the places
we're still growing away from.

Maybe a specific example
will clarify. After the dancing
celebration, I felt elated, encour-
aged, supported, amazed by all
of us and our (dare I use the
word?) collective energy. I also
felt alone, scared, and discon-
nected. Of course I was the only
person who felt disconnected.
Everyone else felt in harmony.
Aha! Not so! Several womyn
with whom I spoke afterwards
felt as I did.

This is all a process we
Amazons are living out. Depen-
dency, low self-esteem, bleak
stuff... centeredness, self-confi-
dence. Sometimes we can’t float
solely on attachmentless self-
love. When I felt alone with my
fears and needs, I felt bad and
backslid — the old roots pulled.
But when I found others feeling
similarly, that gave me the
strength to own and attend to
the fears/needs/jealousies I do/did feel, because I understood them not as stuck-forever
places, but growing from places.
We have lots of old roots to pull
out of old soils.

This is all a rambling self-
affirmation of my process,
shared because it seems to be a
process many of us share and
need connection around. And
this is a request/hope that we
will share more of ourselves —
the ups and the downs.

In sisterhood and struggle
we are crying and
laughing together

Power in
Unity

Dear Commonwoman,

Between the time Dian
Mueller interviewed me and
when the article was published
(“Why Betty Friedan?,” May,
1979), many changes happened
to me personally, and to my
work as a reflection. It is one of
my greatest dreams, to keep
myself open to change and to
hear what is being said from the
heart of those I come in contact
with. It is my hope that what I
say on one day (with all the
hassles, pressures, and excite-
ments unique to that moment)
will not be etched in stone. I
want as much permission to
grow and change and learn as I
try to give to those around me.

It hurts too much for
women to be on opposing sides
of the fence, not to mention the
energy drain. We have so much
work to do to reach our com-
mon goal of freedom from
oppression and degradation. Let
us begin to support the different
paths we take to reach that goal.
There is so much power in our
unity!

In struggle,

Hannah Dennison
