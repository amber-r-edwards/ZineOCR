FEBRUARY 1981

COMMONWOMAN

It has come to my attention
recently that racism is still alive

and well in our midst. And it has

reared its ugly head through
music no less. There is a new
song that is being played at
discos and on radio stations
called “Turning Japanese.” Per-
haps you have already heard its
catchy beat that makes you
want to get right up and dance.
Innocent enough. What people
may not know about “Turning
Japanese” is that the song
implies the ecstasy of orgasm in
masturbation by implying that
“slant-eyes” of Asians are just
like squeezing your eyes shut as
you reach orgasm.

I found myself asking,
“What do Japanese eyes have to
do with the pleasures of mastur-
bation?” I still wonder where
people get the ideas that they
get. But I’m afraid that a new
form of the old racism still
remains in White Amerika.

In 1981, most white people

call a Black a nigger, a Native
American a savage. It’s even
uncool to call an Asian a chink
in public. It seems that members
of the white race must always
have a new racial group to
degrade. They do this by making
slant-eyes to a song at a disco.
These very same people may
then leave the disco and con-
demn racism at a political
meeting.

It seems that we must

attack a new stereotype almost
every time we turn around. It
isn’t that long ago that white

actors were “aping” Black peo-
ple with primate-like actions.
The movements of the ’60s have
shown us that Blacks were not
going to be degraded anymore
and thus the Black Power
Movement. I grew up hearing the
old thing about Asians being the
“role model” for Blacks. The
Asians were to be this model
because of their diligent work
habits, cleanliness, and sub-
missiveness. The whites were
telling the Blacks that they were
lazy slobs with filthy personal
habits, and were dangerous
animals to keep away from good
little white children.

Now, the Asians are being
associated with masturbation.
This shows that white society
has never dealt with its disease
of racism or its horrid repression
of sexuality. What makes people
use sex to degrade another
person? Why is it that other
whites aren’t degraded as the
Third World peoples are degra-

ded?

Western Man (I say man
because he has all the power on
this planet) has never been
happy unless he has someone to
degrade and conquer. I have my
own theory on this. I believe
that racism was born during the
birth of Christianity. In Christian-
ity, the devil, or Satan, was
black. He is a perversion of the
pagan Horned God. The Horned
God represents the wintertime.
This is the time of dying and
many species of plants and
animal life are dormant. The
dark color of the Horned God

became bad in the eyes of the
early Christians. The color black
also carried this tainted associa-
tion. When the whites began to
explore and conquer the world,
they believed that dark-skinned
people were the devil and
they must be destroyed. Millions
were and still are being
destroyed. In 1981 white lives
are still worth more than the
lives of people of color.

I have read in Common-
woman that racism was being
discussed within the lesbian
community.

I think it is great that white
people are examining their own
forms of racism. From the song
“Turning Japanese,” I have
learned that the subtleties of
racism have no end. There seems
to be a lot of creative energy
going into creating new kinds of
racism. Why can’t this energy go
into new ways of relating and
connecting with all kinds of
people?

The racist behavior during
the song is even more offensive
when gay people do it. You
would think that gays would be
more sensitive towards degrada-
tion and the damage it does to
people who are its victims. When
an Asian goes into a gay disco
and is confronted by racist slant-
eyes, I’m sure s/he feels the same
way as a woman who gets sexist
remarks on the street. Or when a
gay person goes into a bar and is
confronted with anti-gay
remarks. If it doesn’t feel good

Looking at

By Gail Gordon, Robin Mide,
Jan Schaeffer and Judy Wolff

(Note: This article was
written in response to “To
Whom It May Concern,” by

Mimo (Karen) Davis and Con-
suelo Quinones, which appeared
in the December 1980 issue of
Commonwoman.)

As Jews reading the article
by Mimo and Consuelo about
the racism of white women in
Burlington, we want to point
out and correct several anti-
Semitic statements in it that
made us angry. Before we do
that, we want to say clearly that
we validate the angers and fears
expressed by Mimo and Con-
suelo. You have every right to be
angry at the white women in
Burlington for their racism. As
Jews, we are as guilty of racist
values and actions as anyone
with white skin. Most (but not
all) Jews in this country are
white-skinned and use that white
skin privilege. The fact that most
of us can pass as members of the
dominant culture, when we walk
down the street or apply for
jobs, makes a big difference
between the oppressions of Jews
and of people of color.

But the reality is that Jews
are different, very different,
from the dominant culture, and
when it’s known that we’re
Jews, we are treated differently.
We feel that Mimo and Consuelo
did not understand that being a
Jew in this non-Jewish culture is
an alienating and paranoid rea-
lity. We carry around in our guts
the reality that our people have
been scapegoated, wiped out and
hated throughout thousands of
years of history. But that
persecution is not just history —
it’s present reality, in Israel
(notwithstanding many of
Israel's fucked up policies), in
Russia, in Ethiopia, in Argen-
tina, in every country in greater
or lesser degree. It can often be
confusing, in the U.S., to under-
stand the oppression of Jews.
After all, myth has it that most
Jews are rich, if not middle-class,
and that Jews have a lot of
power. It’s true that Jews are
allowed more visibility, and, in
some places, influence than
people of color. But power is
different than influence.

We didn’t have enough
power to save the Jews of
Europe during World War II
when the U.S. government sat
back and did nothing. We
don’t have the power to save our
people in Israel if the U.S.
government decided it was no
longer in their interest to sup-
port Israel. Like other peoples,
Jews are pushed in this society

to make it by assimilating —

giving up our culture, fixing our

semitic noses, forgetting our
history, and buying into a
culture that steals our words,
our speech patterns, our food
and music and makes fun of us.
Dominant white culture hates
Jews and would just as soon
wipe us out.

Mimo and Consuelo, your
anger is valid. We don't intend
our response to take away from
your anger, in your eyes or
anyone else's. We know that all
non-Jews are anti-Semitic, just
like all whites are racist; that’s
the conditioning none of us
escapes in this hate-filled socie-
ty, and we all need to get rid of
the crap we’ve learned. We want
to educate you about anti-
Semitism. We feel that out of
ignorance of what anti-Semitism
is and out of your anger you felt
justified in shitting on us, and
we will not allow it. When
Jewish women have gathered in
this town as Jews, white women
have been bent out of shape
about it. A radical dyke even
said she thought the move to
reclaim ethnicity might be con-
servative! Your arrogant assump-
tion that the white community
would not be threatened by
Jewish unity implied that we are
not a threat to white supre-
macy because we are white. It is
anti-Semitic to not understand
our vulnerability as an oppressed
minority and to perpetuate or
add to that vulnerability is racist.

Though most American Jews
are white-skinned, much of the
world Jewish population is not
white-skinned — we are Spanish,
Ethiopian, Iranian, Indian, and
more. As we said before, whites
don’t consider Jews as part of
them. This is true since the
initial invasion of Judea-Israel
3000 years ago when the Middle
Eastern, Semitic Jews were
forced to move into white
eastern Europe. We were the
conquered and colonized out-
siders, and our existence
throughout history has depend-
ed upon the mood of the ruling
class of whatever country we
were in. Hitler’s genocide could
not have succeeded in a world
that was not already sick with
anti-Semitism. We have been
raped and exploited to the point
where we look like our oppres-
sors. It’s important to under-
stand that white supremacy is
the common enemy of Jews and
Third World people.

It angered us that you could
first understand how Michelle
Cliff could be oppressed as a
Third World woman who can
pass, and to then invalidate as
“petty” the response of empa-
thetic identification of a blonde-
haired, blue-eyed Jewish woman
