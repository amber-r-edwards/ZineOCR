The Women’s House of  
Transition continues to grow  
and expand as a vital community  
service in Chittenden County.  
Over twenty-five women attended  
the volunteer training session on October 12. Potential  
volunteers were presented with a  
variety of ways to get involved  
with the organization. Our primary  
needs are for hotline  
workers and safe home providers. Hotline workers are on call  
once a week or every other week  
for a twelve-hour period to  
provide support, advocacy, and  
follow-up to the women who  
call. Safe homes are private  
residences offering temporary  
shelter for women suffering  

from domestic violence.  

We are also looking for  
people to provide transportation  
for battered women and their  
children, donate food for bake  
sales, give us moral support, do  
childcare for meetings, accompany  
battered women to court,  
the hospital, police, etc., as  
advocates when the hotline  
worker is busy, distribute pos-  
ters and leaflets, and help with  
fundraising and grant writing.  
There are many ways to get  
involved besides being an on-call  
hotline worker or safe home  
provider.  

We currently have eight safe  

homes in Chittenden County.  
We expect to have at least six  
more by the end of the year. We  
are specifically looking for  
homes that might be available  

for a more extended period of  
time, like a week or two. Most  

of the homes we have now are  
available for one or two nights.  
Before we place a woman in a  
safe home, she must sincerely  
agree to our requirement that  

she keep the name, phone  
number, and address strictly  
confidential.  

We continue to receive  

about six to eight calls a week  
from battered women needing  

help. As the weather gets colder  

they have fewer options when  

they are forced to leave their  
home because their violent hus-  

band is threatening to kill them.  
They are reluctant to stay with  
neighbors, families, or friends  
where they might be easily  
found. So far we have been  
successful in placing these wom-  
en in safe homes, if only for a  
night or two. We also encourage  

volunteers as hotline workers. We  
will meet every other week to  
share information, support, and  
feedback. If you missed the  
training session on October 12,  
you can still get involved. Call  
658-1996 if you are interested in  
volunteering for the Women’s  
House of Transition or for more  
information about our project  
and services.  

SQUISH  
SQUASH  

By Joyce Cheney  

When one of the Common-  
womyn asked me to write  
another food column, I was  
embarrassed. War, Reagan for  
president, and I’m gonna write  
a food column? She reminded  
me that life goes on on many  
levels, all valid.  

And so, some ideas on how  
to cook winter squash. It’s  
cheap, locally grown, and a basic  
for those who say it is most  
healthy to eat in-season produce.  
I've tested these recipes with  
acorn, butternut, buttercup;  
hubbard and pumpkin could be  
used too. There are many ways  
to cook squash; believe me, I  
know. One winter my house-  
hold, in an economy move,  
bought 300 pounds of it. We ate  
it all, in the process trying every  
recipe we could find...  

To cook plain squash, cut  
the squash open, scoop out the  
seeds, peel or not as you prefer,  
steam or pressure cook it. Serve  
with butter, tamari and oil,  

maple syrup, or honey, at the  

table. Or mash the cooked  
squash, mixing in any combina-  
tion of butter, tamari, oil, spices,  
sweet or sour cream, milk, maple  
syrup or honey, brewer's yeast,  
and serve.  

To bake squash, don’t peel,  
remove the seeds, cut into  
serving-sized pieces, wipe lightly  
with oil, place in a pan that has a  
little water in it, and bake at 375  
degrees. Or cut squashes in half,  
place them inverted on a pan  
and bake. They’ll steam them-  
selves with their own moisture.  
When they’re almost done,  
invert them, and add whatever  
you like — seasonings, butter,  
honey... and cook a little longer.  

To cook squash seeds,  
spread the seeds on a shallow  
pan. Sprinkle with oil, and  
generous combinations of basil,  
salt, pepper, tamari, oregano,  
garlic, or anything you want  
them to taste like. Bake at about  
400 degrees. Watch them close-  
ly. They could take from 8 to 20  
minutes. You may have to stir  
them. Let them get crisp.  

Here is one specific recipe  
for mashed squash. For every 2  
cups mashed squash, add  
cayenne and tamari to taste, 3 T  
brewer's yeast, 3 T tahini.  
Mix and eat hot or cold.  

Squash soup: Cook 2 large  
acorn squash. Cut into chunks  
and blend, adding enough water  
to get it to blend. Blend 4  
medium onions, 1 heaping T  
miso, half a head of garlic (get  
your friends to eat the soup  
too...), ½ c. tahini, plus water  
enough to get it to blend. Mix it  
all and serve hot or cold.  

Another good orange winter  
dish: cut the following veggies  
into bite-sized chunks: 3 yams, 2  
white potatoes, 2 tomatoes, 2  
big carrots, 2 large onions, add  
rutabaga or turnip if you like  
them. Add 2 t tamari, and mix  
in enough oil to coat the veggies  
generously. Bake in a covered  
baking dish at 400 degrees until  
things are soft and yummy —  
start checking after half an hour.  

Tone Poem of The Heart #4  

Always I come to you at sunset  

my longing near sated  
by the intensity of the moment  
as I watch clouds turn gold  

pink to grey,  

graced by a touch of lavender.  

I dreamed of lying atop you,  

my ample breasts and belly softness  
spread over your broad breasts  
and generous hips.  

I dreamed of smiling into your face,  
of brushing back the soft curls  

to kiss your forehead  

and quietly gazing eyes.

community agencies, we are  
helping to set up a support  
group for battered and ex-  

battered women. This forum will  
provide them with an opportunity  
to meet and talk with  
other women in similar situa-

they are not alone.  

There will be ongoing training

custody of the children until a
