RESISTANCE STRUGGLE NON-VIOLENCE UNI  
Radiation Protection and Healing

This article is reprinted with  
permission of the author. It will  
appear in CW in two consecutive  
issues.

All of us alive now are  
victims of radiation. The front  
line victims — Native Peoples  
whose land is being mined for  
uranium, those living or working  
near mines, nuclear power  
plants, labs, and waste disposal  

sites, military people forced  
unknowingly into — radiation  
exposure — are dying and  

suffering severely now. Even  
people who aren't in contact  
with high radiation levels — i.e.  
everyone else — are exposed  
enough now for health to be  
affected. Medical x-rays and  
x-ray treatments, high voltage  
power lines, microwave towers,  
color television, and seepage into  
the air, ground, water, and food  
from nuclear technology affects  
everyone.  

However, there are ways for  
us to protect ourselves from  
radiation — both in the way we  
live our lives and political action.  
I think we are deliberately being  
taught that radiation damage  
and cancer are inevitable, so that  
we will feel more powerless  
about change. They want us to  
think cancer is inevitable in  
order to keep us powerless. This  
system is telling us that there is  
nothing we can do to stop  
damage to our bodies. It tells us  
there is nothing we can do to  
stop our environment from  
being destroyed, our lives from  
being taken from us day after  
day. It also tells us we cannot  
stop our progress toward nuclear  
annihilation. But there are things  
we can do. We can stop this: We  
do have the power if we will  
take it. I do not intend the  
health and food suggestions in  
this article to take the place of  
people’s action. Some damage is  
so severe that alternative health  
cannot stop it. People on the  
front lines are already suffering  
and dying. Natural health care  
can only sustain us, help us  
break the pattern of invasion to  
our own bodies and lives as we  
fight for the life of the earth.  
Body Damage and Health

Radioactive damage to the  
body happens in three ways.  
Radioactive particles can bomb-  
ard cells and kill whole cells.  
Particles can kill parts of cells  
causing them to be sterile (not  
reproduce themselves), or to  
mutate. Cells can mutate in  
many ways: change in shape or  
size, not produce chemicals they  
are supposed to, not eliminate  
cell waste properly, etc. Or they  
can mutate to keep growing and  
reproducing in one place without  
stopping, which is cancer.  
The third way particles damage  
is to ionize body tissue. This  
means that unstable radioactive  
atoms will bond with body  
tissue and cause an electrical  
charge, break apart and change  
body chemistry. The effect of all  
this damage is to cause people to  
grow old faster, to be more  

likely to get so-called “old age”  

diseases such as heart disease or  
diabetes. The body’s disease  
protection system is weakened,  
causing people to die sooner.  
One spinal x-ray can take a year  
off a person’s life. The damage  
can cause birth defects, and  
spontaneous abortion. It can  
cause cancer. Since increases in  
the rate of cancer is the easiest  
to prove scientifically, it gets the  
most attention. “Old age”  
diseases and earlier aging happen  
in varying degrees to everyone  
exposed to radiation. Again,  
cancer is not inevitable. The  
body has a natural immunity  
system which fights off and kills  
diseases and unwanted tissues,  
and this system will fight off and  
kill cancer. Everyone probably  
gets cancer in the beginning  
tumor form. It only reaches  
severe stages if the immunity  
system is weakened or over-  
loaded trying to fight off other  
things.

tissue, and so that the natural  
protective barriers of skin, bone  
covering, and cell walls are as  
strong as possible. Thirdly,  
special substances found in cer-  
tain kinds of foods can break  
down radiation and pass it out  
of the body without harm, or  
will bind radioactivity to certain  
body organs such as the intes-  
tines, where it is made harmless.

Natural blood cleansers and  
system purifiers also help get rid  
of radioactive substances.  
Finally, there are first aid  
techniques for severe radiation  
damage.

Foods -

The best general protection  
is regularly eating lots of vege-  
tables and fruits, and eating  
simply — avoiding foods which  
will strain the body such as  
preservatives and processed  
foods. Leafy green vegetables,  
sprouts, and smooth-skinned  
fruits and vegetables are most  
important. These provide vita-

Below is a breakdown of where radiation affects the body

Natural radiation healing  
can take several forms. The first  
is to strengthen the immunity  
system and stay as generally  
healthy as possible. The second  
is to have enough vitamins and  
minerals so that radioactive  
forms of the minerals will not be  
taken in and bonded to body

The times listed next to the type of ray  
emitted are the half-lives: how long it takes for  
half of the radioactive material to break down.

I deliberately don't use the  
word “diet” to describe ways of  
eating because of its meaning of  
weight loss. Good health has  
nothing to do with weight or  
lack of it. “Dieting” and oppres-  
sive attitudes toward large size  
bodies are only more ways that  
have been used to keep people  
apart, alienated from our own  
bodies, hating ourselves and each  
other. Thinking about eating  
radiation protective foods as a  
“diet” brings into natural peo-  
ple’s health all the oppressive  
ways “dieting” has been used  
and strengthens the control large  
corporations have over our  
bodies and how we feel about  
them. Radiation protection has  
nothing to do with weight or  
losing weight.

Chlorophyll: produced by  
green plants. There is evidence  
that chlorophyll is radiation  
protective. It neutralizes poisons  
and toxins, and cleanses and  
rebuilds body tissues. Wheatgrass  
is a strong source of chlorophyll.  
Wheatgrass is the sprouts of  
wheatberries, a common grain  
found in regular grocery stores  

or health food stores. The  

sprouts are grown in a thin layer  
of moist dirt and eaten like  
alfalfa or bean sprouts — in  
salad, or sandwiches or by  
themselves. They can also be  
made into juice.

Miso: a salty, fermented  
grain product in mash form. It is  
made from soybeans, rice, barley  
or other grains. You can buy it  
in Chinese or Japanese food  
stores or health food stores, or  
make it yourself. Miso can be  
mixed with all foods as a season-  
ing, used as a sandwich or bread  
spread, or as a broth or soup  
base dissolved in water. Miso has  
a substance called Zybicolin.  
Produced by miso and natto  
yeasts, it attracts, absorbs and  
rids the body of radioactive  
elements. After the U.S. dropped  
the bomb on Japan in 1945,  
Doctor Akisuki and the staff of  
his hospital “worked daily in  
prolonged close contact with  
fallout victims in areas which  
were heavily damaged and highly  
radioactive.” They had been  
drinking miso soup regularly and  
did not suffer from radiation  
damage.

Vegetable Oils: Olive oil and  
peanut oil protect and rid the  
body of radioactive particles in  
radiation sickness. If they are  
rubbed into the skin they  
protect people working in  
atomic labs, plants, or mines.

Seaweed: Seaweed, kelp,  
and algin from brown Pacific  
kelp remove radioactivity and  

supply iodine and other  
minerals. Can be bought in  
grocery stores, Chinese or  

Japanese or health food stores,  
and eaten powdered as a season-  
ing, in soup, or as a vegetable.

Sunflower Seeds: contain  
pectin which binds Strontium-90  
(a radioactive element) in the  
intestines and reduces absorp-  
tion.

Blood Cleansers: These  
foods and herbs maintain good  
health. They help strengthen  
circulation and remove impuri-  
ties from the blood. Garlic,  
onions, ground ivy or creeping  
charlie (made into tea), sarspar-  
illa and sassafras tea together,  
burdock tea, dandelion root tea,  
and agrimony. Garlic and onions  
can be eaten regularly as clean-  
sers. They also help keep people  
in general good health.

Vitamins: Vitamins that  
help are large doses of E and C,  
fairly large doses of calcium.  
Regular doses of B-Complex and  
lecithin, and also rutin, from  
ground buckwheat, help.

Clay: Clay absorbs radio-  
activity in the body. Geiger  
counter experiments have shown  
that dry clay absorbs a large  
amount of radioactivity in the  
atmosphere after bomb tests.  
Drinking clay dissolved in water  
will absorb toxins or poisons in  
the intestines. Clay can be  
bought in health food stores.

Brewer's Yeast: A good  
source of Vitamin B and gener-  
ally healthful. Can be used as a  
seasoning or drunk mixed with  
juice. Sold at health food stores  
and maybe grocery stores.

WHAT TO DO FOR  
RADIATION POISONING:  
(severe) Mix one teaspoon  
baking soda, one teaspoon salt  
and one quart water and drink  
18 oz every two hours. If  
symptoms appear in head, chest,  
throat, glandular system or nasal  
cavity, add ½ teaspoon cream of  
tartar to the solution. Con-  
tinue dosage until all symptoms  
are gone. Take 3-5 grains of  
calcium with each glass of liquid.

My personal philosophy  
about eating in general is: be  
easy on yourself. Changing eat-  
ing habits is no small matter — it  
involves feelings about your  
body, childhood and culture. I  
know my eating habits are a  
form of security linked to my  
identity — when I change them I  
change more than just food. I  
think in our society the kind of  
change that is encouraged is  
drastic, cold-turkey. That way is  
easier for some people, but not  
for many of us. So if you want  
to, change gradually, don’t be  
hard on yourself, see it as a  
process. If you go back to the  
old ways for a while, maybe you  
need to, the tide will turn back  
later. Maybe you don’t want to  
change all your eating habits,  
but just add some of these foods  
to what you already eat. Or  
maybe you do want to change  
drastically. I don’t think we  
know enough about our bodies  
yet and the reasons why we like  
to eat what we do for anyone to  
have all the answers. So, keeping  
radiation protection in mind, do  
what feels best to you. Experi-  
ment.
