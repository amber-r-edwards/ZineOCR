Kittatinny: A Tale of Magic, by  
Joanne Russ. Daughters Publish-  
ing Co., Inc, $5.00.  
Reviewed by Michiyo Cornell  

I had a delightful time  
reading Kittatinny, it's the first  
adventure story I’ve ever read  
that had a young woman as a  
hero and had her go through  
adventures much as Tom Sawyer  
and Huckleberry Finn do in  
Mark Twain’s stories. The most  
striking feature for me was the  
reinterpretation of old sentimen-  
tal stories into something  
approximating modern sensibili-  
ties. Underneath the “simple”  
story is a sophisticated under-  
standing of women’s psychologi-  
cal herstory. Kit’s journey starts  
by accident when she gets lost  
following a wolf in the woods.  
The rest of the book follows  
her journey back home and the  
various mythic creatures she  
meets: The Little Mermaid, the  
Woman Warrior, Sleeping  
Beauty, etc.  

She also meets Baby Bro-  
ther (a baby satyr) in the  

woods. Baby Brother wants to  
become a human child, since he  
hates the thought of being  
a satyr who will just have  
offspring out of “a sense of  
duty” that Baby Brother will be  
forced to abandon to grow up as  
best they can. Luckily for  
Kit, she doesn’t have to eat as  
long as she carries Baby Brother  
which is “like carrying a cloud”  
on Kit’s back.  

Kit is a delightful young  
woman who cries when she gets  
scared (as when she discovers she  
is lost) but who also uses her  
head in time of danger. Her  
encounter with Slouches will  
illustrate the point. Slouches are

granite creatures who crowd in  
on a person and crush her to  
death. Kit thought about escape  
or someone rescuing her, then  
she realized she could cut a  
Slouche’s legs out from under it:  
“It was exactly like cutting  
twigs. It was easy. It was exactly  
the right thing to do. Slouches  
can’t be attacked directly, but  
those long, skinny, stringy legs  
are their weak point. They take  
months to grow back, and until  
they do, the Slouch is helpless.”  

Kit also meets mythic  
figures who have been reinter-  
preted. Sleeping Beauty, for  
instance, is a vampire who had  
been an overprotected child.  
The vampire wasn’t allowed to  
go out and play like other  
children. She was forced to stay  
in, be lady-like (passive) until  
her folks decide to have a spell  
put on the Princess to protect  
her even more. The spell worked  
the wrong way and Beauty  
turned into a vampire while  
everyone else in the palace slept.  
The last thing Beauty says to Kit  
is, “Don’t ever let them lock you  
up.” Certainly a welcome change  
from the passive Sleeping Beauty  
who waits for her “Prince” to  
come and wake her.  

I must also put in a word  
about the illustrations by  
Loretta Li. They are lovely ink  
drawings which would help any  
reader—young or old—visual-  
ize Kit and the characters Kit  
meets. My favorite is the one of  
Taliesin, the dragon Kit meets. I  
won't say what happens when  
Kit and her young friend, Rose  
meet again at the end of the  
story. Read it and find out!  

The Magic Coloring Book, by  
Joknee AvRutick, pictures by  
Etana Finkler  

Reviewed by Joyce Cheney  

Available at Bookstacks,  
and from the witches who  
created it.  

“I’m thinking about my  
friends in Vermont,” Juanita sat  
just under the moon. “My heart  
is open to you.” The moon hung  
silver and centered. The message  
moved low atop the ground at  
first, then lifted like a bird into  
the sky, bouncing off the belly  
of the moon into Vermont.  
“The moon is the same distance  
from me as from you,” Juanita  
said, out loud to herself and to  
her friends in Vermont. “I hope  
you are thinking of me tonight.”  
“Ella, Ella, Ella,” Juanita chant-  
ed, before closing herself like a  
flower bud.  

How to be objective about a  
book written/illustrated by two  
of our very own Burlington  
dykes? There we are on the  
cover, Burlington womyn danc-  
ing together under the moon  
while Juanita mind-stretches to  
us under that same moon  
thousands of miles away.  

The Magic Coloring Book is  
a product of Etana and Joknee’s  
many month, many mile journey  
thru Mexico, Belize, and Guate-  
mala last winter. The stories are  
tales of the real magic they  
experienced there; the characters  
are real. Joknee and Etana share  
their adventures with us —  
Caribbean seas, Grandmother  
Spirit House, jungle river trip,  
dolphin ferry, the market, the  
snake, the moon, the butterflies,  
the children...  

The words — slow, calm —  
make pictures of someplace very  
different from Vermont.  

light, ringing sounds like  

tropical bird feet walking in the  
sand...  

The music swept airily. It  
twirled and twisted like smoke;  
like a balloon it scurried quickly  
through the jungle and gently  
shook the trees.  

The pictures — simple, fun  
to color — are also of images  
new to most of our eyes: jungle  
plants and birds, thatched huts,  
ocean — but aren't those two  
Vermont dykes I keep seeing in  
those pictures?  

The book doesn’t claim to  
be everything: too many skinny  
womyn, no mention of the  
political realities in Mexico and  
Central America, no thoughts on  
what it means to be white  
American tourists there. Some-  
times the book is confusing.  
Joknee and Etana were too close  
to the stories in their writings;  

they needed to step away a bit.  

Sometimes the stories just don't  
have enough background and  
tying together information for  
someone meeting them the first  
time to follow or enjoy. Some-  
times the book is confusing  
because of untranslated Spanish  
words. It is an airy book — for  
the butterfly, moonglow,  

“shredded-coconut-sky-of-stars”  

parts of us. It is about magic —  
about joy in life.  

“I wish I could see a dol-  
phin,” said Gitana, being careful  
not to wish too hard, for fear of  
scaring the magic. “It’s a funny  
thing magic,” she continued.  
“It’s always happening. When  
the magic shows itself to you,  
it’s a matter of trusting what  
you see and feel, without  
holding on. Because as soon as  
you try and hold on to it, as  
soon as you try and make it  
yours, the magic disappears! It  
ceases to reveal itself.”  

Magic doesn’t replace strug-  
gles and head-work. We need  
both to get through. Don’t run from  
the word magic. It is not anti-  
struggle — just anti-worry. It is  
simple noticement of the won-  
derment of life. The Magic  
Coloring Book brings some light/  
warm/star/smiling to us. One of  
these next chilly nights take care  
of yourself, and let Juanita and  
Gitana share the magic of their  
adventures. A good reading and  
coloring story for kids of all  
ages.  

Her Voice in the Drum, by  
Rebecca Beguin  
Reviewed by Barbara Hirschfeld  
Rebecca Beguin was raised  
in South Africa, where English,  
not American, was spoken.  
French was her second language,  
and Afrikaans had its influence.  
Her writing reflects this aspect  
of the foreigner, toying with  

idioms. Rebecca has always  
loved the maze, the runes, the  
Celtic mysteries. Now — she  

a-mazes us with her rune-writing.  
In the thicket of clichés gone  
mad, metaphors intertwined like  
jungle vines, we find the inner  
chronicle of a lesbian swept  
away by erotic love, and coming  
home to herself and the comfort  
of an old friend.  

This book comes over you  
like an orgasm: personal, with its  
own rhythm. With a sense of  
humor about herself — in  
juxtaposition to the passion  
she finds herself embroiled in,  
the author plunges us into the  
vast sea of womyn’s emotions.
