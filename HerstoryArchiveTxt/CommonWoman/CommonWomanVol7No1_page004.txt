LOVE  
AND  
ATTENTION  

Smithfield, R.I. (AP) —  
Fifteen housewives who say they  
are overworked and underloved  
have declared themselves on  
strike until their husbands stop  
taking them for granted.  

“Appreciation... isn’t too  
much to ask for a slave who's on  
call 24 hours a day,” said Terry  
Waterman, one of the group of  
neighbors who have sworn off  
cooking, cleaning and other  
household chores until their  
husbands meet their demands.  

Five of the women were on  
the picket line for a second day  
Saturday outside their homes in  
their neighborhood of this rural  
town northwest of Providence.  

“We'll do absolutely none  
of the things that wives and  
mothers are normally expected  
to do,” vowed the movement  
organizer, Gloria Gangi. She  
carried a homemade sign that  
asked: “Have You Hugged Your  
Wife Today?”  

“The strike won't end until  
all the husbands get together and  
agree to pull their weight and  
show us some recognition for all  
the work we do. There'll be no  
meals, no laundry, no nothing,”  
she said.

“Pictures I Inherited”  

By Euan Bear  

From February 7 through  
February 28, I’m showing mat-  
ted photographs I’ve inherited of  
women in my family and photos  
those women saved of their  
friends and classmates. The  
oldest image is a 1945 copy of  
an 1888 portrait of my great  
great grandmother, my mother’s  
mother’s mother’s mother. Some  
of the pictures I know nothing  
about — not when they were  
taken or even who is in them.  
Many of them are of graduates  
of the Lincoln (Maine) Aca-  
demy, a “Normal School" for  
teachers. My stepfather’s mother  
went there and saved her class-  
mates’ pictures (Class of 1909)  
— and those of the children she  
later taught — for over seventy  
years.  

I've looked at these pictures  
a lot in getting ready for this  
show. The faces, especially the  
ones I know nothing about,  
intrigue me — I wish I knew  

more about them. Most of the  
pictures aren’t necessarily artis-  
tic photography, but there’s a  
roundness to the images, a  
whimsical look, a contrast  
between the deadly serious ex-  
pression and the huge hair bow  
that draws my eye.  
Pictures both take me out of  
myself in seeing pieces of others’  

lives who have had very different  

experiences from mine and  
remind me to take myself  
seriously: these women are my  

kin; because they existed, so do I.  
They remind me that I really  
do exist in the world. They are  
large substantial women — their  

pictures help me affirm myself  
as a fat woman too.  
I'm having a  

closing gathering on February  
18, at 8 p.m. at EWP. Please  
come, bring a picture, a story to  
pass around and share, food if  
you can and want to.

Teachers  

TEACHERS!! How does  
your feminism reveal itself in  
your classroom? How can  

feminism be integrated into our  
schools at every level — not  
just token courses or a separate  
Women’s Studies program? Nur-  
sery, elementary, high school,  
college teachers, members of  
woman's “true” profession,  
I would like to hear your stories.

THE CRONES NEST:  

A Community for Older Women  

IMAGINE... a nest of  
Crones, in which women may  
live together as we age; as we  
die. IMAGINE... a place affirm-  
ing in its processes the self-  
determination of each woman  
within. IMAGINE... a place  
where the wisdom of elder  
women is celebrated; wherein an  
elder woman may lead as active,  
as purposeful, as vocal — or as  
quiet, and contemplative — a life  
as she wills. A place which will  
welcome women whether hale or  
worn-down, of whatever color or  
creed or economic condition.  
But which is designed especially  
for women who, whether they  
are lesbian or heterosexual,  
choose to live their last years in  
community with other women.  

Such a space will be humane  
and womanly for the residents  
and for those providing care; will  
attract women from all points  
on the spectrum of age who  
share an interest in providing  
shelter and nurturance to elder  
women. Will provide a model to  
be copied, critiqued by like-  
minded projects, and by resi-  
dents and operators of less  
conscientious homes.  

Such a space will be built  
with sensitivity to the needs of  
aging women’s bodies. Will have  
softened corners, wide passages,  

places to mingle, to be alone.  
Colors, Music. Occupations for  
bodies and minds.  

The Crones’ Nest: A Com-  

munity for Older Women, is  
sponsored by the women of the  
Pagoda Temple of Love, a  

spiritual and cultural center for  
all women, located in St. Augus-  
tine, Florida since July 7, 1977.  
The Crones’ Nest is also being  
supported by donations from  
older women interested in this  
project.  

We are currently preparing a  
written description of our plans,  
goals, visions and financial  
needs, both long and short term.  
The first three months (October-  
December) are focusing on fund-  

raising, researching and designing  

the Crones’ Nest. The second  
three to four months (January  
— April) will focus on obtaining  
oral and film herstories of  
women 62 and over. These  
herstories will help create and  
design the Crones’ Nest, and  
will give us information on the  
housing and nurturing needs of  
aging women. The final time  
period will be spent developing  
and implementing the Crones’  
Nest, and writing and submitting  
grants to individuals and founda-  
tions for funding of the Crones’  
Nest: A Community for Older  
Women.  

IMAGINE... such a space  
and help us to realize our vision.  

Tax deductible donations  
can be made to the Crones’ Nest  
Project, and sent to the Pagoda.  

If you are unable to send a  
donation at the present time,  
but are interested in staying on  
our mailing list and receiving  
more information, please let me  
know. If you have ideas, experi-  
ence or other input to contri-  
bute, please let us hear from  
you.  

Many of us for many years  
have had fantasies of such a  
place. It is past time to turn  
fantasy into reality.
