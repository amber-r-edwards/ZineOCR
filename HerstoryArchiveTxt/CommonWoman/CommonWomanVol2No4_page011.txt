EXHIBIT

Church Street Center

The UVM Church Street
Center has announced a feature
exhibit, ‘Photographs by Young
Women’ of the Elizabeth Lund
Home. The photographs in this
exhibit are selected from appro-
ximately 2000 images made over
a six-month period by the
Elizabeth Lund Home residents
who participated in this special
project, funded by the Polaroid
Foundation and administered
and coordinated by the Image
Co-op, Inc., of Montpelier.

Seventeen girls and young
women between the ages of
fourteen and nineteen, plus one
older woman in her twenties,
edited their own pictures down
to approximately 200 for a
scrapbook at the residence, and
from those the images displayed
here were selected for display.

Each young woman who
chose to participate in the
project was given a Polaroid
camera for a two-month period
of time, returning it for use in
other Image Co-op projects each
alternating week during two
months. The camera was return-
ed every other week with a fresh
supply of film, and the Image
Co-op staff who worked at Lund
Home one afternoon a week
(Kenneth Lewis and Mike Bil-
lingsley) helped solve practical

picture-taking problems as they

arose.

The exhibit will be on
display at the Church Street
Center, 135 Church Street, Bur-
lington, until Tuesday, June 19,
1979. The public is heartily
encouraged to visit.

The Church Street Center
also announces a fresh variety of
workshops and mini-courses
beginning in late June on sub-
jects ranging from Accounting
for Small Business to Stone
Masonry to a study of the
I Ching, the ancient Chinese book

of divination. Two six-week
courses of special interest to
women are “Career Planning
Seminar for Women” and “The
Challenge of Human Sexuality.”

Sidney Holts, who is pre-
sently a counselor at the Center
for Career Development on the
UVM campus, offers a practical
seminar to enable women to
understand and assess what may
otherwise loom as the fore-
boding world of the outside. By
the end of the seminar, partici-
pants should feel more comfor-
table with the process of career
planning (which includes values
clarification, skills identification,
research and investigation tech-
niques, reality testing, etc.) and
should be able to employ it
when needed. They should also
be able to identify work-related
resources and should have iden-
tified several tentative areas of
work interest.

The emphasis of the course
on “The Challenge of Human
Sexuality” is education and
awareness, as opposed to ther-
apy, in order to further each
participant's efforts to develop a
personally satisfying sexual value
system. Bob Fine, presently an
Associate Professor of Social
Sciences and chairman of the
Human Services Certification
Program at Johnson State Col-
lege, will lead a supportive
discussion dealing with issues
and concerns presented by the
women and men in attendance.
In this way, participants may
address the need they share to
manage their sexuality through-
out a lifetime that promises
considerable personal and social
change.

Both these courses will be
held Thursday evenings, begin-
ning June 21, and require a
pre-registration. To register, to
request a catalog, to inquire
about other courses, workshops,
films and discussions offered at
the Church Street Center, or to
gather further information about
anything you may want to learn
or to teach, all are invited to
visit the Center at 135 Church
Street, or to call at 656-4221.

Status of Women

Fun and Games with the Gover-
nor's Commission on the Status
of Women -

By Robin Taylor

On March 12, 1979, Repre-
sentative Glendon King of
Northfield, a member of the
Vermont House Appropriations
Committee, proposed to that
committee that the Governor's
Commission on the Status of
Women be renamed the Gover-
nor’s Commission on the Status
of People. The Appropriations
Committee agreed to King’s
proposal and the new name was
inserted into the state budget.
Various individuals, includ-
ing members of the press,
noticed the change immediately
and contacted the Governor's
Commission on the Status of
Women (GCSW). Other people
contacted Jim Douglas, the
majority whip in Vermont's
House of Representatives. When
the budget was to be voted on
by the House on March 22, Rep.
Douglas proposed that the name
be changed back to the Gover-
nor’s Commission on the Status
of Women.

I asked Rep. King why he
had proposed such a name
change. His response was,
“Everyone should be treated
equally.” I couldn’t say another
word. My reality was too separ-
ated from his dream.

Rep. Douglas’ statement in
support of the GCSW was not in
the local papers, but he was kind
enough to repeat its essence for
me. “Despite considerable
strides in recent years there still
is a need for some advocacy for
women’s rights and because
there are still discrepancies in
salaries and employment oppor-
tunities, it seems to me that this
commission, or something like
it, needs to be continued.”

After the budget had been
passed by the House of Repre-
sentatives, it was sent to the
Senate Appropriations Commit-
tee. On March 29, the Senate
Appropriations Committee
accepted the proposal of its
chairman, Senator Boylan, to
reduce the funding of the GCSW
from $55,300 to $1. Sen.
Boylan has said that he feels the

GCSW is a waste of taxpayers’
money.

Despite lobbying efforts by
the various commissioners and
many others, the $1 funding for
the GCSW was approved by the
Senate on April 11, by a vote of
19-11.

From the Senate, the bud-
get went to the Joint Conference
Committee on April 13. There
were six men on that committee.
Representatives Carse, Graf and
Smith from the House Appro-
priations Committee met with
Senators Boylan, Horrigan and
Gannet from the Senate Appro-
priations Committee. The Joint
Conference Committee released
the state budget on April 20.
The funding for the GCSW was
$40,000.

“Take Back the Night” was
the resounding cheer that went
up from the voices of several
hundred women participating in
a localized version of an event
that happens nationwide on
April 28 yearly. These marches
were formed in protest of the
“authorities” telling us that we
should stay home and off the
streets at night because they're
unsafe for women, children and
old people... This instead of
confronting the rapists
themselves or the real problem
of making streets safe for us.

The march came together
quickly through the combined
efforts of the newly-formed
Women’s Rape Crisis Center and
the University of Vermont's
Women’s Center. There was little
formal publicity; mostly several
hundred women managed to
attend purely through word of
mouth. I know personally of
women who attended this event
coming from as far away as
Montpelier.

Before the march I was at
the Margie Adam concert taking
place at UVM’s Ira Allen Chapel.
When Margie heard about the
march that was forming, she
announced that she was going to
join us and encouraged all
present to attend.

On the steps of Ira Allen
Chapel women were already
gathering and the momentum
for the march was being charged
by women playing percussion
instruments and singing different
favorite Holly Near tunes.

The night was clear and
black. It was a little chilly for an
early spring evening. The only
mar in my vision was the police
escort readying up for our
“tour” of Burlington’s unsafe
streets. We didn’t need them.
They were there — it became
apparent later on — to protect
them, not us. I overheard a
woman’s comment as we were
beginning to march that is a
favorite. They were driving slow-
ly in front of hundreds of
women strong, marching abreast.
She said, “Why don’t we just go
over them.” We could have.

As we were gathering and
people left the concert, Lucy
from the Women’s Rape Crisis
Center called out to us to begin
convening on the drive directly
in front of the Chapel. She also
told us that this year we had a
parade permit “allowing” us to
proceed through the streets of
Burlington rather than having to
keep to the sidewalks as was the
case the year before. I can’t help
thinking they had some inkling
of our numbers this year, as we
would have been difficult to
contain to the sidewalk.

As we marched down Main
Street to the center of town and
back up Pearl, we began chant-
ing the messages of the evening.

There was a coalition effort
by all of the women and some
concerned men in the House of
Representatives to find another
$15,000 for the GCSW. Unfor-
tunately, they did not have quite
enough strength. The budget was
passed on April 21.

Anne Sarcka, executive
director of the GCSW, says that
there is just no way that the
commission can cut its budget.
Money will have to be found
through writing grants. This will
mean that valuable time and
energy will be taken from what
the commission should be doing
to do fundraising.

I think the entire legislative
process is a fairly good state-
ment regarding the status of
women in Vermont.
