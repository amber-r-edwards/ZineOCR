TOURING THE BRIGHT
LIGHTS OF
BURLINGTON

By Baba Rose

I played my first pinball
game many years ago while in
graduate school and working as a
residence hall advisor. Whenever
the claustrophobia of intimate
living with 800 people would
overwhelm me, I would lose
myself in the bright lights of a
campus pinball machine.

Generally, pinball held little
fascination for me and my
occasional forays would only
reaffirm my abysmal eye-hand
coordination. Besides, the scantily-clad and busty women in
helplessly seductive poses held
no allure. Given a spare quarter
and a pool table, my eye-hand
coordination rarely failed me.

I can’t recall precisely when
I started playing pinball again.
Accustomed to dropping into
Charlie's to meet friends and
shoot some pool, it was quite a
loss when it closed. Eventually, I
found the pool tables upstairs at
Upton’s and would cruise the
arcade games en route. After a
time the pool tables were
removed, but by then the arcade
games had become familiar and I
was able to play ‘eight ball’ via a
pinball machine.

In the past two years I’ve
become a devoted and sometimes
addicted arcade game
player. My preference is still for
pinball — as opposed to the
electronic video games — since
they are slower paced and my
eye-hand coordination is less of
a problem. And it is wonderful
when I find a friend who is also
into pinball.

As a feminist, however,
making my way through the
political and social issues repre-
sented in arcade games has
proved most difficult.

Once beyond pure visual
fascination and a generalized
guilt over enjoying any of the
games, I slowly began to appre-
ciate the cultural statements
they make. Indeed, it is no
exaggeration to say that the
world of arcade games is a world
of men, violence, science fiction,
and sex — in that order.

MEN: Most game players
are male; most female players
are there as companions of men.
Pinball games, in particular,

present extremely powerful male
images — medieval knights, jungle ‘lords,’ fire demons hurling
fireballs — and invite the male
player to participate vicariously
in that power. Teenage boys can
actually be seen relating to these
games as though they are a real
test of their masculinity.

VIOLENCE: Arcade games,
especially the electronic video
type, offer countless ways to kill
and destroy, usually through
simulated war. There is in this
setting something quite frighten-
ing about the spectre of war and
killing having been reduced to a
‘game.’ To walk into an arcade is
to be inundated with death and
destruction. For this generation,
John Wayne, as everyman’s hero,
has been replaced by a quarter
and an electronic game that
allows every boy to be his own
hero in battle.

SCIENCE FICTION: In and
of itself this isn’t too bad except
that most games feature inva-
sions, death and destruction.
There are a very few exceptions,
e.g. Alien Poker and Lunar
Lander where one attempts to
land a spacecraft.

SEX: The most extreme
example of its use in a pinball
machine is one called XENON.
Outwardly one would never
suspect it to be a sex machine
since XENON is a humanoid of
undetermined sex. Put in a
quarter, however, and a sultry-
voiced female says, “Welcome to
XENON.” Please keep in mind
we're not talking about a place.

Every time the ball hits the
bumper, our sultry-voiced
female says, “Ahhh...” (S&M?)

Putting the ball in a certain track
causes the ball to travel through
a long plastic tube while our
sultry-voiced female says,
“Ahhh... do that again.” Invari-
ably it is 12-16 year old boys
playing this (sex) machine.

Touring the bright lights of
Burlington can be an instructive
glimpse into the male world, as
well as fun if done selectively.
For would-be adventurers, I
offer the following mini ‘tour
guide.’

TYPES OF GAMES

PINBALL, Old Fashioned:
characterized by scantily clad,
busty women (usually white) in
helplessly seductive poses; may
or may not be accompanied by a
scantily clad and well-muscled
male protector (also white). e.g.,
‘Tarzan, Jungle Lord, James
Bond, Flash Gordon.

PINBALL, New-Fashioned:
basic game is the same but is
presented in a space motif with
exotic humanoids and some
form of combat. Additional
variations include machines that
talk, advising you what to do
next, congratulating you on
your accomplishments, and
challenging you to try again. e.g.
Black Hole, Fire Power,
Embryon, Black Knight.

ELECTRONIC VIDEO
GAMES (EVG), Blatant Death
Machines: these ‘games’ attempt
to simulate reality by creating a
total environment; e.g. in a
rumbling, maneuverable tank
destroying other tanks (Battle
Zone); shooting down other
planes (Red Baron); looking
through a periscope to launch
torpedoes; sitting inside a dark-
ened plastic bubble destroying
invading spaceships.

E.V.G., Less Blatant Death
Machines: these ‘games’ are no
less violent than those above,
they merely lack the simulated
reality. Some of this type
include Astro Invader, Wizard of
Wor, Astro Blaster, Missile Com-
mand.

E.V.G., Benign Games of
Skill: these games usually offer a
good eye-hand coordination
challenge with varying degrees of
difficulty, but are notable for
their relative lack of violence.
Included here are a variety of
road races, jumping frogs (Frog-
ger), Donkey Kong, a number of
maze type games (Tarc, Mouse
Trap, PAC-MAN), and a fine
game for lefties called Quix that
involves coloring in a screen
while avoiding some moving
colored lights.

WARNING

Addictive personalities
beware! Arcade games are
designed to give the player the
sense that if you play just one
more time you will do better.
Setting a dollar limit well
beforehand, or only carrying a
limited amount of cash will be
helpful ways to control addictive
tendencies.

WHERE TO PLAY

Shaker Mountain School has
a small arcade on North St. near
Champlain where your quarters
will help support the school.
They have mostly pinball
machines (and a pool table in
the back).

Aladdin’s Den, University
Mall, is mostly ‘death machine’
types and is peopled primarily
by kids being entertained while
their folks shop.

Barrel of Fun, Church St.
Mall, has a mixture of games
with slightly more pinball than
usually found in arcades. It
draws a lot of local young
boys and offers specials regular-
ly. e.g. ladies night.

Galaxy 6, on Williston Rd.
near the movie theatres, draws a
mixed crowd because of the
movies. If you want a broad
sampling of the Benign Games of
Skill, then this is the place to go!

Upton’s, Church and Main,
is mostly ‘death machines’ of
one sort or another. Arcade
watching, however, is best here.

ANARCHA-FEMINISM

By Laurie Larson

In the last issue of Commonwoman I began to outline a bit
what I see anarcha-feminism as being. Three basic tenets agreed
upon by most anarchists include (1) a belief in the abolition of
hierarchy, government and authority, (2) belief in both diversity
and unity, and (3) a belief in both spontaneity and organization.
I look to women as the catalysts for a social revolution as they
actually live it. I’m not sure how to attain utopia or arrive at any
semblance of what is “true,” but I do look to nature as one of the
few reliable teachers I have had. To know the land is to be
“grounded” or “centered” and to find a starting place towards
discovering self-empowerment. To understand natural cycles and
relationships is for me to understand anarcha-feminism...
and I am only just beginning. Please excuse me for talking too much; men-
tal masturbation is a questionable skill I’ve acquired from the
male European world of academia. I think I’ll stick to poetry and
music after this. And revolution,

This is getting rhetorical,
heady.” I agree. It’s all bullshit
on paper. So you say, “A lovely
utopian ideal, but no pragma-
tism.” But it is possible. There is
a history of the anarchist vision
actualized here on earth (as
opposed to Ursula LeGuin’s
planetary “other,” Anarres).
Among the pagans and witches
of medieval Europe, the Diggers
of 17th-century England, and
the people of the 19th-century
Paris Commune there was much
more than a trace of anarchist
activity. Native Americans for
centuries unknown have lived
using many anarchist principles.
Even groups like the Sandinistas
which are often thought to be
Marxist in nature, have strong
anarchist roots (hence the black
in their banners along with the
red).

In this century, over eight
million Spanish Anarchists
reclaimed over 60% of the land
and industry in Spain to be
worked collectively during the
Spanish Civil Wars. In Paris in
May-June 1968, students protes-
ting the war sparked a general
strike which almost started a
revolution. Unfortunately, as in
Spain, the Communist Party
worked against the direct, spon-
taneous actions of the students,
teachers, and workers in the
streets; “the Revolution must be
dictated from above.” The
moment was lost and workers
never actually seized the fac-
tories to work them using total
self-management...

The sixties in this country
saw protest after protest, which
did not have the consciousness
that the feminist and ecology
movements of the seventies have
offered the radical left. The
anti-nuclear movement in this
country is modeled on an
affinity-group structure, and has
pushed an ecological “issue”
towards a more political focus
with wide popular appeal. The
feminist movement has worked
for the most part in colorful
decentralist ways, and has em-
phasized process, as well as the
importance of a social (not
merely political) revolution.

Locally, in Burlington, there
are anarchists in several affinity
groups who do such varied
things as publish a great (if
sporadic) newsletter called
“Black and Green,” organize
educational direct actions and
street theatre, work to make
neighborhood organizations and
councils a viable reality, and
challenge the existing leftist
groups and politicians to go a
little further. We worry about
the industrialization of the Inter-
vale and valley farmland in
Chittenden County, the plastic-
capped and neon-sculptured gen-
trification of Church Street and
(coming soon!) the Waterfront,
the militarization of the already-
indoctrinating schools, the seem-
ingly unchallenged and rampant
development in Burlington to
turn it into a condo-ized suburb
with mall after mall (mauling us
all), the blatant harassment,
objectification and assault of
women from fraternities, bars,
the media and every mannequin
on Church Street, and on and
on. And on. I get depressed
sometimes, but never bored. Our
affinity group also networks
with others in New England, the
rest of the continent and over-
seas. As women, we understand
the necessity of this kind of
support.
