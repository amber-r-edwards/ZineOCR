Listening ........  
And Moving  

By Deane Brittingham  

Information is power, and  
with it we become powerful,  
transformed and empowered.  
That is why there is such an  
all-out effort by the right  
wing to keep information from  
us. An all-out effort to suppress  
us as women — what we have to  
share and know about ourselves,  
and each other. Each time as  
women we speak out and share  
our lives, we empower ourselves  
and other women, and we begin  
to end the lies and silences. Our  
Bodies, Our Selves, a book by  
and for women, is being targeted  
by the right wing as obscene.  
Why? Because it speaks out,  
teaches us and informs us. In  
Richford, Vt, an attempt was  
recently made to ban John  
Steinbeck’s Grapes of Wrath, a  
book about Oklahoma families  
who migrated to California during  
the Depression. Why?  
Because it too teaches us differ-  
ences, and therefore, informs us.  
But, we are listening... and  
moving to action.  

We are listening to the  
fallacies told by the Reagan  
administration. And we see the  
contradictions in what they tell  
us we should do, and need,  
and what they are doing and  
getting. We are aware of the  
ever-increasing use of violence  
against women by men. Last  
month the FBI reported that  
there has been a 5% increase in  
violent crimes, including rape,  
aggravated assault and murder,  
in the first 6 months of ‘81. We  

CHAN  

are aware of the violence against  
women in the right wing's  
attempts to define who we are,  
to limit our reproductive rights,  
our rights as women to control  
our bodies, to seek abortions.  
And we know of the hatred and  
violence committed against  
those of us who are Lesbians. We  
are aware of the attempts  
to do away with affirmative  
action programs.  

We read the newspaper  
accounts (given with no com-  
ments) of the horrendous sexual  
and physical abuse of a 2-year-  
old girl in Montpelier, and the  
release of her assailant — her  
father. We read on the same page  
of the same paper of the sen-  
tence plea-bargaining on behalf  
of the 16-year-old boy who  
killed his pregnant lover. We  
read of the agreement by male  
attorneys and judges to suppress  
evidence in the trial of Louis  
Hamlin, who killed a 12-year-old  
girl. Evidence of incest, porno-  
graphy, evidence of deep-rooted  
hatred of women in the family.  
What we don’t read about is the  
collective decision made by local  
press to not report the details of  
this brutal, sadistic murder, this  
violence against women. But we  
know why this information is  
being kept from us.  

We also read the names of  
the “prostitutes” in Burlington,  
but not the names of the cus-  
tomers. Why? Because the men  
are “prominent” Burlington citi-  
zens. We read in the Vanguard  

205 Dorset St:  

Press the boys’ editorial on  
“Prostitution Hysteria” and  
their reasoning that the men  
were possibly only “potential”  
customers. If we are to assume  
there is any logic to this argu-  
ment, then aren’t the women  
also only potential “prosti-  
tutes?” And we read the boys’  
solution of legalizing prostitu-  
tion, assuming men’s rights to  
women’s bodies. We are listen-  
ing... and moving to action.  

We are listening to and  
aware of Reagan’s $36 billion  
cuts in human service programs  
and the concurrent $1.5 trillion  
increase over 5 years in military  
spending. And we know who  
will be paying for this. It’s not  
Reagan, the ‘modest million-  
aire’ according to national  
columnist Hugh Sidey. This  
“modest millionaire” with 6  
pairs of $1,000 cowboy boots, a  
ranch, and $200,000 worth of  
new china to eat off, while other  
people simply starve. We know  
that these cuts will primarily  
affect women and children by  
cutting abortion rights and fund-  
ing, day care, welfare, Medicaid  
and social security benefits. We  
know these are attempts to keep  
us as women controlled. We  
know not “allowing” us the  
ERA keeps us in slavery. We  
know that keeping us home,  
beaten, barefoot and pregnant  
will keep us out of the job  
market and economically tied to  
men and their violence and  
hatred.  

We are aware of Reagan’s  
concept of a “limited nuclear  
war,” a war which even the  
Congressional Office of Techno-  
logy Assessment tells us will kill  
in the first 30 days between 2  
and 20 million of us!! We know  
about Three Mile Island, and  

As women, our resistance  
to men’s teachings and use of  
war, violence and hate, requires  
a revolution of thought, action  
and power. This Revolution  
must be brought about by  
women, supporting and validat-  
ing women. Women unafraid  
of, untied to and unwilling to  
protect men. Women unwilling  
to stand still, waiting for men.  
Women willing to bond toge-  
ther for each other and ourselves  
in peace and community. We are  
listening... and moving.  

Vermont Yankee. We know  
about the 35 reported “broken  
arrows” — accidents with  
nuclear bombs. And we know  
that the greatest threat of  
nuclear destruction to the U.S.  
comes from the U.S. We know  
of the U.S. involvement in

supporting oppressive military  
regimes and dictatorships around  
the world,  

In the 60’s and 70’s many  
of us worked for the future  
through the civil rights, women’s  
and anti-war movements. It is  
now the future, and this  
isn’t exactly what we had in  
mind.  

But we are listening... and  
moving to action.  

This month over 3,500 women  
encircled the Pentagon,  
creating different, positive ener-  
gy, using mind games creating  
new thoughts, affecting today  
and tomorrow, making deep,  
root changes. Knowing if we  
aren't listening and moving  
today for an end to all this  
violence, there simply won't be a  
tomorrow.
