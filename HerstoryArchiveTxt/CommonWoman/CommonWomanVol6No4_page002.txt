Waitressing

By Linda Comito

It should be stated quickly.  
Even though there are more  
women corporate executives,  
bank trustees, professors and  
doctors than ever before, the  
general work situation for most  
women has not been signifi-  
cantly affected. Nursing, secre-  
tarial work, teaching (in elemen-  
tary school) and waiting on  
tables are the jobs that continue  
to be dominated by women.  
85.1% of those who wait on  
tables are women (Monthly  
Labor Review, April, 1982).  
Today women earn fifty-seven  
cents to every dollar a man earns  
(down two cents from 1970).  

The 57 cent figure is a  
blatant piece of information,  
offensive and overwhelming.  
There are more subtle bits of  
education in the scheme of  
women and work. For instance,  
jobs that were once male-  
dominated, well-paid positions  
have become, over time, low-  
paid positions—dominated by  
women. Bank tellers and elemen-  
tary school teachers are exam-  

ples of this.  
Then there are the consistent,  
persistent reports of  
inequality from the U.S. Depart-  
ment of Labor. In April 1982,  
for the same job: on  

Nice Jewish Girls — An  

Introduction to a Review  

Oy — to write a review of  
Nice Jewish Girls — I can't do it  
— but an introduction, a begin-  
ning — yes — for visibility, for an  
end to invisibility.  

“Jewish invisibility is a  
symptom of anti-Semitism as  
surely as lesbian invisibility is a  
symptom of homophobia.”  
(Evelyn Torton Beck in her  
introduction to Nice Jewish  
Girls). Nice Jewish Girls is about  
the invisibility of Jews, and anti-  
Semitism in the world, in the  
women’s movement, in the les-  
bian community, in relation-  
ships, and within ourselves. It is  
about the invisibility of lesbians  
in the Jewish community; it is  
about the invisibility of Sephardic  
Jews among Jews. It is the  

passion, anger, voices of many  
Jewish lesbian women — sister  
thoughts to my own, precious,  
rare, here in Christianland New  
England.  

I am a Jewish lesbian  
woman of Eastern European  
cultural tradition — grand-  

daughter of Polish and Russian  
descent, second and third gener-  
ation American. I was born in  
Brooklyn Jewish Hospital and  
grew up in Queens, New York  
hearing Yiddish from my grand-  
parents only in choice expres-  
sions. When they talked to each  
other in Yiddish we (kids) were  
not to understand. Nice Jewish  
Girls speaks directly to my  
experience as an Ashkenazi Jew.  
With Yiddish inflection and  
phrasing page after page it rattles  
free forgotten parts of my  
childhood, opens a closet of

The statistics build up  

against women. It is not true,  
the numbers state, that a woman  
will be treated as an economic  
equal if she gets the same  

education and does the same job  
as a man. Yet women continue  
to enter new fields, further their  
education.  

I have read of female law  
students being harassed by their  
male colleagues. I have read that  
female college professors com-  
plain of unequal treatment.  

I was given a new title and  
responsibilities but not the usual  
raise. (It was explained that I,  
being female, was lucky to be  
getting the experience.)  

The situation is more than  
a struggle with a set of percen-  
tages and mathematical com-  
parisons. The facts, the statis-  

tics that illustrate a woman’s  
economic status in this society  
do nothing to clarify the causes  
or results of the dynamic they  
expose. Power, vitality, expec-  
tations, relationships between  
men and women, women and  
women, members of a family —  
all are affected.  

And what is being said to  
women?  

If money-earning capabi-  
lity is a measure of respect in  
our society, does earning fifty-  
seven cents to the man’s dollar  
mean that women’s work is not  
important, that their money is  
“pin-money,” that they do not  
belong in the working world  
even though they spend eight  
hours a day there?  

Is it too late or too early  
to understand that when a  
woman does the same job as a  
man she should earn the same  
amount?  

Ask any waitress. She is  
doing it for the money. Whe-  
ther she is supporting her  
children on her own, support-  
ing an artistic interest or politi-  
cal activities, saving to go  
on a trip, paying tuition. She is  
doing it because she can earn  
more as a waitress than she can  
in other fields where women  
are accepted and, for most  
women, these are the jobs she  
can get.  

I know of female construction  
workers who are daily taunted  
by the men they work with... a  
female press operator who can  
get no information, no support  
from the male employees.  

I quit an office job because  
her employer pays her very  
little (where money can mean  
reward and respect in a socie-  

ty).

dusty but familiar vocabulary  
and expressions. Reading this  
book my body aches for an old  
familiarity. But Brooklyn to  
Burlington, nice Jewish girl to  
radical lesbian feminist is a long  
ache. I am a Jew in Diaspora.  
What does that mean? Jews not  
in the Homeland, Israel, Jews  
not among Jews, Jews not  
among family. Why? I am not a  
child, but a grown lesbian  
woman and not a teacher, no  
grandmother to whisper sweet  
Yiddish in my ear, bubbele,  
shana maidele. Can I come back  
to the relatives with women on  
my lips? No child. No wedding  
to dance at. Harriet Malinowitz  
in her story Coffee and Cake  
speaks for me. She realizes as her  
brother responds to her coming  
out with “Why is it so important  
to you to tell the world?” that  
“...the crazy thing I hoped to get  
from him. I hoped to see him  
dance.” YES!  

Dovida Ishatova says, “But  
to be a Jew, the daughter of a  
survivor, and a lesbian? How can  
that be?” And we are all daugh-  
ters of survivors on an actual or  
an emotional level.  

Not all Jews are Eastern  
European. Sephardic Jews, a  
“minority within a minority” in  
America, “don’t know from  
Yiddish and gefilte fish!” Rachel  
Wahba’s words. In reading her  
writing and in attending recently  
an evening on Sephardic Jews, in  
San Francisco, I realize how  
pervasive the “Ashkenazi  
assumption” is — that I, as a Jew  
grew up with only vague images  
of what Sephardic meant, with  
no sense of the separate history  
and culture of these Jews — with  
whom I share a history of  
persecution and murder for  
being Jews.  

Antisemitism. I ask, Why is  
this ism different from other  
isms? Why in the litanies of isms  
— racism, classism, sexism — is  
antisemitism not there? And I  
imagine your answers — because  
Jews are “passing” in America.  
(Two generations past, Nazi  
Germany, Jews, passing and not,  
gassed.) Because Jews have made  
it in America, have privilege,  
(passing with changed noses  
and names and straightened  
hair — that’s a privilege.)  
Because Israel is an imperialist  
state. Because Black people are  
more oppressed. And I hear my  
own answers of fear and inter-  
nalized antisemitism echoed and  
elaborated in Trena Klepfisz’s list  
of questions for Jews in her  
essay, Anti-Semitism in the  
Lesbian/Feminist Movement.  
Internalized antisemitism. I  
recognize it in myself so recently  
it shocks me. An article I wrote  
for Commonwoman last issue —  
a meeting I attended last month  
— where I recited isms and left  
out antisemitism. “If I am not  
for myself, who will be?” (Rabbi  
Hillel).  

Antisemitism in the  
women’s community doesn’t  
only come in the form of  
omission. Evelyn Torton Beck in  
one of many recountings,  
describes an antisemitic passage  
in our beloved Rubyfruit Jungle,  
and her own reaction to it at the  
time. “In 1974, as an emerging  
lesbian, I didn’t want to admit  
that the movement's leading  
fiction writer was basing her  
humor on age-old anti-Semitic  
stereotypes. I simply couldn’t  
afford to take it in. So I kept  
silent. In those early years of  
struggle it seemed unworthy to  
make a fuss. And worse — it  
seemed divisive. I could not yet  
claim my anger. I wanted too  
much to belong.”  

Speaking out, getting angry,  
recognizing self-denial and anti-  
semitism is an awakening, a  

“remembering for many of us  
who have blended into the  
women’s community melting  
pot without noticing that the  
goddess was always carrying a  
five-pointed star. This month  
let’s call her princess as a recla-  
mation of a negative stereotype.  
Let’s picture her pushy, and  
dark-haired, and carrying a  
Jewish star. Melanie Kaye in her  
excellent article Some Notes on  
Jewish Lesbian Identity provides  
us with a list of words to  
reclaim. What's the matter? You  
don’t want to reclaim Jewish  
American Princess?  

Our images, our culture, has  
been absorbed and assimilated  
and tokenized at the choice of  
the gentiles who love Passover,  
and hate Israel, who love choice  
Yiddish expressions and use  
them with more ease than I who  
struggle with my ch’s to say  
chutzpah like my grandmother.  

I realize that this is not an  
introduction to a review after  
all. It's a reaction. It’s a rash. A  
rash of unspoken feelings, fears,  
and accusations beginning to  
surface.  

For Jewish Lesbian Women.  
Yes Yes Yes. Read Nice Jewish  
Girls. This book is ours. You can  
taste it like noodle kugel, like  
hamantaschen, like rugelach,  
like chocolate covered halvah —  
treats I don’t get enough of. I  
hope it opens us to talk more to  
each other — to name anti-  
semitism when we feel it — to  
feel pride in our families, our-  

selves and each other as Jews.  

These reactions are dedicated to  
Carol Cohen who told me so.
