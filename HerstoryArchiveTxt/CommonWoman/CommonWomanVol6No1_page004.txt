**KLAN PROTESTS**  
By Sherri Keefe  
Raleigh, N.C. — About 20 robed Ku-Klux Klansmen marched to the Capitol seeking commutation of the sentence of a white man convicted of firebombing a black-owned newspaper, Virgil Griffin, identifying himself as the Grand Dragon of the Invisible Empire of the Knights of the Ku-Klux Klan, said they were protesting because “a white Christian brother is in jail.” He accused Governor Jim Hunt of being “prejudiced against white people.”  

Lawrence Little, serving a life sentence for his conviction for the firebombing of a newspaper, is the self-described “propaganda minister of the Rights of White People organization.” Uniformed police and undercover agents lined the sidewalks. No trouble was reported as the 20 or so spectators, including several black children, watched in the chilling rain, seeking the $10.5 million judgment against the Kerr-McGee Corporation. The panel’s ruling reversed a May 1979 federal court jury award of $500,000 in personal injuries and $10 million for punitive damages against Kerr-McGee. Left intact was a $5,000 property award for furniture and clothing that had to be destroyed because of radioactive contamination of Silkwood’s apartment.  

According to Daniel Sheehan, lead lawyer in the Silkwood case, “The Silkwood case is not over. Plutonium contamination and the civil rights of labor union organizers are important issues to the public, both for achieving justice in the Silkwood case and for other possible similar situations.” The nuclear industry cannot be allowed to run roughshod over our citizens’ lives, denying them their human and civil rights. These are moral issues.  

**RAPE VICTIM WINS SUIT**  
Dedham, MA — A 25-year-old woman won a $550,000 civil judgment against the man who attacked her. “It doesn’t matter how much money it was or even if I see any of the money. To hear the judge say, in essence, that this man was guilty of a crime and I have a right to feel the way I do — it was like the final chapter of a book.”  

**FIRED/REHIRED**  
The punitive award was dismissed on the grounds that the 1954 Atomic Energy Act pre-empts state remedies authorizing such damages; the personal injury claim should have been dealt with in Worker’s Compensation Court and the panel felt that the evidence was not enough to support the contention that Karen Silkwood was intentionally contaminated with plutonium.  

**RABBIT ROUNDUPS**  
Boise, Idaho — About 800 farmers in southeastern Idaho have demanded — and apparently won — certain concessions in the past year: the closure of a state prison and of a trailer park housing earthquake victims in Naples, and an end to plans to lay off some 500 auto workers. Men, women, and children armed with baseball bats, tire tools, ax handles, and golf clubs drove about 2,100 rabbits into a pen and beat them to death. Additional roundups were planned.  

**GUARDIAN ANGEL SLAIN**  
Trenton, NJ. — A member of the Guardian Angels, an anti-crime patrol organization, was shot to death by a policeman while both of them were apparently responding to an alert of an attempted burglary nearby. Other guardian angels on the scene said that Frank Melvin, 26, a Black man, was shot dead as he was identifying himself to an officer he was approaching. These witnesses say they feel the officer responded with a typical “knee-jerk reaction” and shot from racist fear as the black man approached in the charged situation of the burglary.  

The police department, on the other hand, called the police department in New Jersey's largest city a “bozo operation.” Melvin was shot by a second officer who was on the roof of a building looking for the robber. He allegedly spotted Melvin approaching his partner and called for him to stop, shooting when he didn’t. Curtis Silwa, founder of the Guardian Angels, is convinced that the police report is a cover-up and is seeking to have a special prosecutor assigned to the case. “You cannot expect county prosecutors, who are affiliated with the Newark political machine, to conduct an impartial investigation,” said Silwa, who called the police department a “bozo operation.”  

**REAGAN INFANT DEATHS**  
Washington — Kathleen Newland of the Worldwatch Institute reported that cuts in the health system to reach out to serve those who need the services. “No country can afford to become complacent about its infant mortality rate,” she explained. “A high rising infant mortality rate, or the demand for a special prosecutor, represents a failure of the health system.”  

She told reporters that cuts in social programs can be expected to exert an upward pressure on infant mortality rates. She said one-fourth of mothers giving birth at the District of Columbia General Hospital have had no prenatal care and attributed that to a combination of “inability to pay, ignorance, and inertia.” This represents a failure of the health system to reach out to serve those who need the services.  

The Anti-Defamation League of B'nai Brith reported that for the third straight year, reported acts of anti-Semitism in the United States have more than doubled. The league cited 974 cases of anti-Jewish vandalism and 350 attacks against Jewish people in 31 states and Washington, D.C. The comparative figures for 1980 were 377 cases of vandalism and 112 assaults.

**HAMLIN SENTENCED**  
Burlington — Louis Hamlin was sentenced to serve six to fifteen years in prison for sexually assaulting his daughter. Attorney Mark Keller said that the sexual assaults had been going on for 11 years, most of the time without detection. Hamlin was charged after police seized pornographic material, taken by remote control, of Hamlin engaged in sexual acts with the daughter.  

**AFTER DOMESTIC ARGUMENT**  
Elyria, Ohio — Clifton Snowden, 21, of North Olmsted, shot his two children, wife, and mother-in-law to death in a crowded shopping mall parking lot after a domestic argument. He then shot and killed himself, police said. The victims were Patricia Snowden, 20, Ellen Mahon, 49, Shyla Ann, 3, and Amber Lyn, 1. Lorain County Coroner William Kishman said the four occupants of the car were dead at the scene.
