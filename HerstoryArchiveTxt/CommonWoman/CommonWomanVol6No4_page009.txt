The Mountain in Me

‘The mountain in me said to stalk on the trace

of a wind dance in stillness and drums

and fire.

‘To coil strings that release fever and threaten sleep.

I remember the small scale circus of events, the
crowded life after birth,
the giving of rapture
the sacrifice of soul.
I slept to dream and filled boxes with silent ragings:
about living colors
about electricity in waking
about swallowing the moon

I wanted to plant peas in the sloshy mud

‘And fever pact with the purpose

To start my body moving with the grace of the seasons
and surrender
alive

It lifted slowly, the mountain in me, like an old person’s
labored dozing breath.

I began swimming

my face, arms and legs;

body in a slapping rhythm,

I whispered,
carry me through... let me just swim back again,
and back,
again-
and back.

‘The water. The foam.

The splashing jubilation of muscle and holiness.

The power of me

against me.

He once said to me,

“You can be whatever you want to be.”

Yes, I said. I know. But it’s not that easy.

It’s not hiding behind you under blankets and dusts
It’s not jumping up assaulting the dawn. -

It's not just filling my skin with white words and stringy expressions.

It’s not gathering faceless babies over and over,

nor quieting the fears of naked boredom with poison and smoke.

It fills the spirit this thing
and crawls through the very rawness of me.
It scares, yet soothes.

It was wrong to be bound in the face of change,
to begin with haggard excuses and end with defeat.

__ We

It was wrong to huddle in dread of war and men spitting at their
own creation.

To silence me for fear of going mad in the giving of my womb back
to the warm soil

in praise;

accepting the reality of not nursing another life again.

It was wrong to condemn

yet not dance at all.

I feared the mountain in me
as it became loud and unruly at times.

I feared the jumpy desperation, the steaming anguish of
invention.

It haunted me in quiet and chaotic days

it wrapped its force and held me immobile.

‘The sadness of dying thoughts, and the vivid quake of lustrous
hues making their way through;

I feared the emerging woman.

Would my voice sing sturdy if I let go—
my legs—

would they bear the pressure of poetry in motion...
would my heart mirror the chants and heed my body
wealth?

It thundered fluently, the mountain in me,
illuminating a soaring genesis.

It came,

as the day comes when you realize the leaves are indeed
transforming into a drama of brilliance.

It came,

lifting the drowsy oppression

the distorted plainness and

simple inelegance

It rose above the waste, the desolation of raped woods
and sky

and began its ascent

and touched with the tender offering of dynamic fervor
an intensity of life.

To love and

seize the day-star shaking it silly,

to cry

yet pass through change

solid, free.

‘The mountain stays forever,
molding a prelude of radiance as I live on.
Ellen Leigh Burke

Caw

There
crows calling
I see you
flapping
towards me
black
hot
low
crow's eye
glint
even teeth
flashing
what would
my mother
caw?

HECUBA TO ME

I used to cry over 19th century novels
when patience and virtue breached mighty walls
and the lovers
who traveled to Ultima Thule
for a gill of cold spring water
always inherited the kingdom of desire

how many summer campaigns and winter sieges
have I been knocking at your locked gates
picking at the mortar with raw fingers
loosening a stone a century
long nights lying awake
alert for the creak of the drawbridge

arcing through all this time
like the strobe-lit image in the citrus commercials
those jewel-drops of juice
spraying into the air
are a hundred million moments of pain and fear
each burning separately
moments when I knew
that you would never

it’s funny
how the seasons change
so quickly
yesterday
there was snow
on the ground
today
I've washed my curtains
and hung them out to dry
somehow
that is significant

a personal sign
of spring's officialdom
the smell of spring
is of freshness and life
I want to take it all in
with a long deep breath
