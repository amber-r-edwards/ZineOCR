POT SMOKING

(continued from page 4)

felt securely focused on my own
process,

In these ways, I put mari-

juana to work for me for
months. Not only did I sense I
was discovering formerly

repressed sides to my person-
ality, but I found that I could
control my moods, divert pain
and in a sense ward off evil
spirits. Smoking pot seemed a
way to fight the passivity of
getting stuck in a bad mood.
Whenever I anticipated a poten-
tially tense situation (staying
home all day with my children,
facing a confrontation at work,
going to a party) I would smoke
in an effort to let go of negative
expectations. Or if I just came
out of an unanticipated tense
encounter I would smoke so that
I could let go of the anger or
frustration or sadness more
quickly — a way to reward
myself for getting through. I
became convinced that it was up
to me to make myself feel good
rather than expect others to
make me happy, and I believed
that I was taking care of myself
by giving myself automatic per-
mission to feel good no matter
what the external circumstances.

Smoking dope was also a
much-loved sensual ritual. I
never rolled several joints so that
I could carry them around like a
pack of cigarettes. I always
rolled one just prior to smoking,
and I loved the challenge of
lighting a match in a stiff wind. I
loved the pungent odor; and the
taste in my mouth as well as the
dryness always reminded me
that I was still stoned an hour or
two later. Sometimes I would
avoid drinking alcohol so I could
preserve that telltale dry-
ness.

The advantages of smoking
far outweighed the damage I
suspected I might be doing to
my health. For one thing there is
no tar and nicotine in grass. And

for another I probably did more
harm to my body breathing
automobile fumes than inhaling
the one or two joints a day that
I enjoyed. I discovered a won-
derful book by Andrew Weil
called The Natural Mind which
had a couple of chapters entitled
“Straight Thinking,” “Stoned
Thinking.” More and more I
sensed the dichotomy between
the straight world and the
stoned world, and dope helped
me go on trips for periods of
time during the day that took
me out of the straight world.

Despite my affinity for the
weed I often did wish that I
could affirm myself as easily
when I was straight as when I
was stoned. However, I figured
that after a while I would just
stop smoking because I would
find I didn’t need it anymore. I
would be so used to functioning
from a sense of inner-directed-
ness, I would create an environ-
ment for myself where linear
time would not be so much of
an issue, and under the influence
of pot I would learn so many
new ways to bring about deep
relaxation that eventually I
would just not bother smoking
anymore. In fact, though, I was
smoking more and more. At
times I would go through
periods of just smoking home-
grown because I felt guilty about
spending so much money on the
stuff imported from some
Southern clime. During those
phases dope might help me relax
for an hour or two during some
part of the day, but after awhile
I craved really getting stoned. By

that I meant smoking strong
enough pot (dark brown, or if I
was really lucky, bright gold) so
that I could put myself into an
altogether different realm — so
intensely aware of the physiolo-
gical effects that I knew beyond
a shadow of a doubt that I was
truly in a stoned state.

Little by little I began losing
trust in my relationship to pot.
For several months when I first
lit up and took those initial
tokes which brought on a rush
of euphoria I would always
accompany that sensation with
an inner monologue which
sounded something like this:
“Ah. This is it. This is how I
need to feel all the time. Now I
remember the frame of mind I
need to be in to cope with all
these changes I’m going through,
with all these decisions I have to
make. Now, if I can only manage
to hang onto this, I'll have it (it?
my life? my problems?) knocked.” But after several months I
found myself getting more cyni-
cal about that initial rush. “Here
I go again — thinking that
everything's going to be great.
Well, everything’s probably not
going to be shitty for the rest of
my life, but it’s also not going to
be great either.” Another prob-
lem I noticed was that whenever
I saw a particularly beautiful
sunset or sat by one of Ver-
mont’s extraordinary babbling
brooks and for some reason did
not have any dope on me, I can
remember thinking, “now if I
were stoned I’d really be enjoy-

WORKER-OWNED
BUSINESS

ing this.” Instead of learning
from my stoned experiences
so that I could carry over what
felt like intense focus on the
here and now, I found myself
focusing on my lack of pot.

Whenever I felt I was
smoking too much I would try
to decide what part of the day I
would benefit the most from
smoking. Should I save my one
joint for the evening when I
knew I could be home alone so I
could assure myself a pleasur-
able, relaxed stretch of solitude
right up until bedtime? Or
should I smoke just after break-
fast so I can start the day aware
of the potential spontaneity
within the structure of my day?
Or should I smoke right after
work so I could make the switch
from hopping from one appoint-
ment to the next dutifully
fulfilling everyone else’s expecta-
tions, to paying closer attention
to my own rhythms, getting
back to that timeless realm of
self-love? I found that once I
made a choice when to smoke,
the times I chose not to smoke
felt like I had to put myself
through at least a few moments
of self-discipline and at worst a
long period of self-abnegation.

But even if I kept down to one
joint a day, I felt as if I was at

least guaranteeing myself one
period of sanity, one period of
pleasure, one period of fulfill-
ment sometime during the day. I
felt as if I deserved at least that
much from my life.

I started smoking dope at a
time when my life seemed secure
and routine. For awhile I
delighted in breaking down my
defenses within the relative
safety of my marriage and my

holiday of such love and won-
derfulness, why wasn’t all the
money for this extravagance
being used for food, clothing,
decent housing and heat for lots
and lots of poor and older
people? (And this was only one
small city in the whole country!)

The scene in Burlington is
not so flashy. But when I saw
the men getting paid to spend
their time driving around, wast-
ing gas to put up decorations,
which waste electricity, all for a
purpose which I find oppressive
and aggravating — I can't say I'm
pleased.

As a lesbian (wimyn identi-
fied womyn) the fact that Santa
Claus, Jesus, and God are all male
images is one more form of
alienation and oppression.
Although I am white, I am not
unaware of how racially oppres-
sive Christmas is as well. A white
savior, a white Santa Claus for
a very white holiday.

So next year, when you
wish someone a merry Christmas,
stop and think or ask if Christ-
mas has anything positive to do
with her/his life.

One interesting fact: many
businesses in this country get a
large percentage of their profits
for the entire year during the
Christmas season. In other
words, profits from this white,

job, but I feel now as if there
was a dangerous distortion to
those stoned visions... Making
those visions a reality meant
change. In the past year I have
separated from my husband and
one of my children, moved,
changed jobs. Dwelling on the
visions while stoned seemed to
postpone for awhile the pain of
letting go. But eventually I
noticed that besides guaranteeing
myself a couple of hours per
day of deep relaxation, intense
excitement, courage or creati-
vity, I found more often than
not that I spent some portion
of that same day anxious and
panicky, overwhelmed by my
problems, weak and ineffectual.
Even though there might have
been several hours between
those two frames of mind, it
occurred to me that smoking
dope was related to those mood
swings. Whereas for awhile I
associated dope with slowing me
down, I began wondering if dope
was in fact raising my expecta-
tions, giving me a delusionary
sense of control over the process
of pleasure. (What? No pleasure
in store for me today? Well, I'll
fix that in a hurry!) I didn’t
want to believe that for every
high there had to be an equal
and opposite low, but I was
aware that during those
moments of panic and insecurity
I would add my smoking habit

to that list of what-I-must-be-
doing-wrongs (as well as not
enough exercise, too much
sugar, too much caffeine, not
enough B vitamins, not enough
contact with people, too much
contact with people, not enough
time spent writing, singing, danc-

Christian holiday have a lot to do
with keeping this white, Christ-
ian, very oppressive country
going.
I’m sure there are people
who will read this and say some
version of, “Oh, can’t she relax
and enjoy anything?” Well, with
nuclear power killing us every
day, poor people freezing and
starving to death, more and
more poor people in jail for
financial crimes, racial tension

still exploding, etc., you can

ing or playing, too much time
spent cleaning an already clean
house). It was getting so that
every time I lit a joint I would
start gearing myself up for the
bout with anxiety which of
course stopped me from getting
high. When it appeared as if the
anxiety was becoming as predict-
able as the euphoria I decided I
had to try and stop smoking.

So I spent a few very
difficult weeks weaning myself
from dope in somewhat of a
desperate effort to control the
anxiety. I started saying “no”
when a joint was passed, I let
myself feel restless and unfocus-
ed out in the woods or home
alone, I wrote without experi-
encing those waves of self-
affirmation. Sure enough the
panic began to subside. For
awhile I was so relieved that I
wasn’t in as much pain as before
that I almost felt high... but not
quite. When the novelty of the
relief from pain wore off, I
began struggling with the fear
that I would never get back to
those soothing hours by the
woodstove, those powerful
visions, that automatic capacity
to remain centered. For so long
my experiences of pleasure were
linked with dope that I felt I had
conditioned myself to associate
pleasure only with dope. I
remember those first couple of
weeks when I stopped smoking I
felt intensely relieved whenever I
caught myself feeling content or
delighted and remembered that I
wasn’t even stoned. I felt a trust
in my world that I hadn’t really
allowed myself to experience for
a long time even though I found
I could rarely hold onto those
moods for more than just a few
moments.

It wasn’t until I stopped
smoking that I became painfully
aware of just how passive I had
become all those months. So
much of my life had been
structured around dope that I
found myself faced with chunks
of time I couldn’t fill. I no
longer could content myself
with sitting still and envisioning
better days to come. Sitting still
started feeling like inertia rather
than reverie. And I began to
mistrust a process that got me
from a place of feeling bad
about myself to a place of
feeling good in five minutes (the
time it took me to get stoned).
I don’t intend to sound
self-righteous. I stopped smoking
dope not because I’m virtuous or
disciplined, but because I had to.
After awhile smoking seemed to
trigger an inner panic that felt
unbearably painful. The panic
may have been related to a fear
of dependency, too intense
a reminder of my former life,
the need to confront the conse-
quences (and the pain) of my
decisions so that I could move
on, or the need to build up
stronger defenses against the
straight world, not tear them
down once or twice a day. My
moods are much more even, but
I miss those effortless highs. I
am certainly not experiencing
pleasure as consistently and as
predictably as before, and I may
try smoking again now and then
to see how I'm affected. My
hope is that I will eventually
regain that love of solitude,
those long periods of utter
relaxation, that freedom from

fear of unstructured time, and

that trust that I can give myself
pleasure without having to rely
on marijuana.
