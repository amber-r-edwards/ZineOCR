Definitions of feminism

“Yes, but...,” I said, hesitating.  
“Ah, ha!” he said, cutting me  
off. “All women I ask say that.”  
He continued, “I think we could  
do a structural analysis of  
American feminism and verify  
that women don’t know what it  
is that they all profess to  
believe.”  
—a conversation with a  
UVM professor  

with silence and savagery  
with impulsion and madness  
we cannot be tamed  
and you fear us  
Aneca Corvo  

A woman wants to cry.  

She is tired of fighting,  

tired of answering back  

to sexist men, peeping  

toms and their FBI friends,  
so-called friends who praise  

her for her sensitivity and then  
turn away, sexist men and women  
who call her he just to  

get her mad,  

health being a joke because  
people will praise her for  

being a vegetarian, natural person,  
and then fill up on meat, coffee,  
cigarettes, people who wear  
fashionable (fascist)  

clothes, while all smiles  

at her as if her depression  

was for their salvation, because  
they won't cross the line.  

Yesterday, Today and Tomorrow  

They grow so fast!!!  

Where have the years gone  
Yesterday I was changing diapers  
Last night I was fixing bottles  

Today has sprung upon me  
You play outside — alone  
You go to camp — alone.  

~ You read stories — alone  

Will tomorrow come so quick  
When you walk out the door  

As independent women  

With lives and minds of your own  

When tomorrow comes, will I let go?  
Will I be sure my job is done?  

I only hope I've aided, in some way,  
Your ability to be all you’re capable of.  

Yes, my daughters, tomorrow is on its way  
And though I’ve made mistakes all along  
I want you to always know, I love you  

Comparing, 1982  

It’s mellowed  

I guess  
to like it is  
in the North —  

No colored and white signs  
Some genuine acceptance  
some grudging toleration  
some murderous hatred  

And the continuing  
picking off of Black people  
by the police.  
—Phyllis R. Sawyer  

To Spanish Moss  
I would never guess  
you were cousin  

to a pineapple  

But then, all relatives  
do not look alike.  

in the summer heat  
the juices flow all over  
abundantly  

unabashedly.  

and it is sweat Father  
and it is blood Mother  

They trickle down my back  
ooze between my legs  

glue me to the chair,  

sweat shit piss blood  

— Phyllis R. Sawyer  

the first time we shared your bed  
we bled... all over each other  

simultaneous moon cycles  
creating beautiful Rorschachs  
on your lavender flannel sheets.  

the first time we shared your bed  
we bled... all over each other  

simultaneous moon cycles  
creating beautiful Rorschachs  
on your lavender flannel sheets.  

I knew I would see her today  

some old connections are beyond verbal justification.  
the significance of this meeting  

lies somewhere between my present and past  

only for me to appreciate.  

We carry on — our pasts into the present  
knowing nothing has really changed,  
yet the details are different  
I want always this unspeakable comradery with life  

I could love your work if the wall you call Separatism  
allowed me my bridges.  
—Jane  

Stillbirth  

Conceived by accident —  
A minor miscount —  
unwanted growth within  
and yet without —  
strange part of me;  
unfeeling, I observe  

it grow full term  

and then give up.  

The labor to expel  

brings full term of pain;  
unexpected agony  

follows the unexpected beginning.  
My screams unheeded  

(except for nurses’ laughter.)  

The shot at last, when  

too far gone to stop  

the involuntary shudders —  

tides, pushing at the dyke.  

No delight — the rhythms  

and feelings are my body's, not mine  
until  

waking after nine months  

semen tears saliva snot.  
words of liquid base reality  
the terse speech of my body  
pouring out, plural, prodigal.  

listen Father  

listen Mother  

don’t be squeamish  

I am made of these words.  
—Aneca Corvo  

And no matter which paths you choose, I'm proud of you.  
—Teresa-Kay Matthew  

I gather strength to push,  
body focused to one end  

No sound now  

No energy spared in that direction  
No thought, feeling  

Just the body’s urging  

It’s done, gone  
Thought returns  
There is no cry  
I am just me.
