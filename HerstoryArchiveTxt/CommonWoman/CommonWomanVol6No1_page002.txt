TAX RESISTANCE

(Commonwoman interviews  
Lori Barg of the Central Ver-  
mont War Tax Conversion  
Effort)

By Paij Bailey

Paij: Why do people choose  
to be tax resistors?

Lori: Our statement of  
purpose speaks of the moral and  
physical imperative of war tax  
resistance. We can control our  
lives in three ways: with the  
ballot, with our money, and  
with our bodies. We are people  
wanting to be socially responsi-  
ble. We are not willing to contri-  
bute to the annihilation of the  
planet. We are willing to pay for  
things people need to live. We  
are not trying to get out of  
something, we're trying to be  
responsible the best way we  
know how. Mary Bacon Mason  
has said, “The only possible  
defense for any people is friend-  
ship and mutual help, that is real  
defense.” I will pay my full tax  
if I can be assured that it will be  
used for civil purposes. I will pay  
double my tax if it will be used  
to aid suffering people any-  
where. But rather than use,  
make or pay others to use the  
sinews of war, I will accept  
prison or worse.

This Valentine’s Day will  
mark the anniversary of one year  
in existence for Every Woman's  
Place. Monday night, January  
18th, an open community meet-  
ing was held to report on the  
status of EWP and to gather  
community feedback. The meet-  
ing was well-attended and  
though discussions were limited,  
some important topics were  
raised. It is hoped that women  
with feedback for the Center  
will attend collective meetings  
to voice their concerns. These  
meetings take place on the first  
and fourth Mondays of every  
month at 7 p.m.

The center is located at 200  
Main St., and is open most lunch  
hours. A lack of staffing has  
forced EWP to have irregular  
hours and they are seeking  
women to staff the place so the  
hours can be more consistent.  
Other events at the center are in  
the calendar EWP regularly pub-  
lishes, and often posted on flyers  
around town. The center has  
also provided meeting space for  
ongoing groups. A sample:  
NOW, Overeaters Anonymous,  
Mothers Support, yoga and  
Commonwoman.

The programs at EWP are  
increasing in number and  
variety. Check this month's  
calendar for a sample. Still, EWP  
welcomes and encourages any  
woman with an idea or desire for  
a program to contact the pro-  
gramming committee and make  
it happen. Speaking for the  
programming committee, Dolly  
Fleming said, “We feel it is  
important to make a concen-  
trated effort to reach all classes  
and races of women. We want to  
publicize that all our programs  
are economically accessible; no  
woman should not come for lack  
of money.” Previously the cen-  
ter has not made that known  
and this is one important new  
decision that seems to have been  
made. EWP is accessible, but this  
will be every woman's place only  
so long as every woman makes it  
happen.

This writer has seen four  
other women’s centers open and  
close in 12 years of women’s  
movement in Burlington. EWP is  
the fifth and most utilized  
center we have had. It is a vital  
resource that runs on woman  
energy. If you want to see a  
thriving women’s center here,  
consider contributing some time,  
energy and/or money to EWP.  
Staffers are needed during the  
day and all committees welcome  
new members. There are also  
one-time jobs and tasks to be  
accomplished, so if you have  
some time but don’t want to  
make a regular commitment,  
consider contacting the center  
about helping in some specific  
way.  
The collective is composed  
of the financial committee,  
Ginny Wynn. Fund-raising: Sue  
Gillis, Pat Torpie, Roz Payne,  
Suzanne Webb, Pat Fontaine,  
Joan Knight. Programming (this  
committee changes periodically):  
Dolly Fleming, Judy Watson,  
Bosha Gordon. Publicity: Mary  
Twitchell and Mitzi Ware. Space:  
Mary Twitchell. Staffing: Mary  
Bently and Nancy Rowan. Library:  
Helen McHenry. Information and  
Referral: Dian Kendrick Mueller  
and Nancy Spanbauer. Art  
Gallery Space: Roz Payne. Two  
new committees were formed  
that need members: the child-  
care and outreach programs.  
Outreach would be a good place  
to direct your energy if you are  
one of the women who thinks  
the center is not reaching some  
segment of the community that  
you are particularly concerned  
about.

EWP’s library is well  
stocked with feminist books and  
periodicals which can be bor-  
rowed or enjoyed in the space.

The Art Gallery space is open to  
any woman who wishes to  
present her work.

The problems EWP is facing  
are a need for more staff and  
more women to help with  
specific tasks. The second major  
discussion that took place at the  
Monday night meeting was  
around finances. The expense of  
maintaining a space downtown is  
high and much of the collective  
energy goes to fund-raising. This  
is something the collective  
would like to be freed from in  
order to focus more on the  
possibility of another, owned,  
space and on doing more out-  
reach. One suggestion that is  
being considered is asking 300  
women for $25 each which  
would cover the rent for a year,  
thus freeing women to put their  
energies into new directions and  
growth for the center.

After the committee  
reports, the talk turned to  
community feedback. The dis-  
cussion was limited by time so  
certain topics were chosen. The  
first issue was that of alienation  
experienced by some women at  
EWP fund-raisers. A woman felt  
alienated and attacked by  
another woman’s description of  
straight women. The general  
consensus seemed to be against  
censorship, but that controver-  
sial material might be channeled  
into certain times, rather than at  
large community events. No  
decisions were made around any  
of the issues discussed as only  
the collective has decision-  
making power. As previously  
mentioned, the collective is  
welcome input at their bi-  
monthly meetings.

The next issue was that of  
men at events. There were strong  
feelings expressed that EWP  
should be an all-women's space  
and that there are few enough  
such spaces for women. Some  
women also felt that men were  
not an asset at fund-raising  
dinners. Other women were  
more open to men but most  
supported the idea of all  
women’s space and all agreed on  
the need to make clear in  
publicity whether events will be  
all women or open to men.

Childcare was discussed and  
it was noted that there has been  
no childcare at EWP events of  
late. Women felt and the collec-  
tive agreed that childcare needs  
to be dealt with. A childcare  
committee was formed. Again  
the discussion just touched on  
the issues involved here.

When people choose to  
resist war taxes there are differ-  
ent approaches. Some people  
send 62% of their tax and use  
the 38% for life-supporting  
causes; some people choose not  
to pay 50%; some people choose  
not to pay 55%. Some people  
refuse to pay anything on the  
premise that the government's  
major financial interest is war  
and that is their major business.  
It is true that the money just  
goes into one pot to get divided,  
so of anything you send, 55%  
will go for war.

Those of us who have  
chosen to take the risks of  
conscience are not trying to get  
out of anything. We are trying to  
exercise social responsibility; we  
are trying to be just. We're angry  
enough and conscious enough,  
and have decided not to buy  
into a business whose service is  
to destroy life. We have set up  
an alternative fund to redirect  
withheld war taxes.

Paij: What are the origins of  
tax resistance in this country?

Lori: I guess one could say  
that tax resistance is as “Ameri-  
can as apple pie.” This country  
was founded on resistance to  
unfair taxation by the British,  
the Boston Tea Party. Of the  
little I remember from fourth  
grade history, it is the cry of  
“No taxation without represen-  
tation.” This country was  
founded on the principles of  
freedom, but we still have had to  
struggle to obtain equality. The  
Civil War abolished slavery, the  
women’s suffrage movement  
gave women the right to vote,  
and the next struggle will  
probably be for the right not to  
kill. If only we could legislate to  
abolish war the same as legisla-  
tion abolished slavery. Tax resis-  
tance has been a method for  
people to act. People get angry  
and they want to do something,  
and something effective. In  
India, Gandhi used the British-  
imposed salt tax for an effective  
nonviolent campaign against  
British Colonial rule. In the  
United States, tax resistance  
helped create this nation.

Henry David Thoreau served  
time in jail because he refused to  
pay war taxes. He said essen-  
tially that one should cast their  
whole vote, not merely a strip of  
paper; that the two requirements  
of war are warm bodies and cold  
cash. Thoreau and others have  
understood the importance of  
taking appropriate action  
according to one’s beliefs. When  
Emerson asked Thoreau what he  
was doing in jail, Thoreau  
answered, “What are you doing  
out of it?”
