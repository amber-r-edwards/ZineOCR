Reflections on Nicaragua — after  
a brief visit in November 1983.  
By Carter Heyward  

Dec. 31, 1983  
On freedom: Is Nicaragua  
building a “free society?” It  

depends upon what you mean  
by “freedom” and with whose  
“freedom” you're concerned —  
The Sandinistas are not inter-  
ested in providing an arena in  
which the few, the monied  
families, have “freedom” to do  
as they please at the expense of  
the poor. The primary objective  
of the FSLN is to create a  
society in which all persons are  
free to live, which means having  
access to food, shelter, health  
care, and literacy skills.  

On the church: There are  
two churches — not, essentially,  
Catholic and Protestant (though  
these branches grow side-by-  
side). There is a hierarchical  
church, governed by bishops and  
other officials, a church divided  
in its loyalty to the revolu-  
tionary process. And there is a  
people’s church, composed of  
the campesinos, workers, and  
their advocates, which has been  
all along the heart of the revolu-  
tionary movement. Seldom have  
I even imagined the depth of  
passionate faith and evangelical  
witness I experienced in our  
meeting with some 150 members  
of the people’s church in Estelí.  

On violence: We so-called  
First World folks need to be  
clear that violence is not a  
monolithic phenomenon, simply  
the means to revolutionary  
change. Somoza’s dictatorship  
was a violent state: held in place  
not only by a vicious national  
guard but also by the sort of  
violent economic and social  
policy that condemns the major-  
ity of people to death by hunger  
and disease. Similarly, the vision  
of the “contras” — to establish  
what they, with the support of  
the U.S., call a “democracy” — is  
a violent vision of toppling a  
government which is feeding all  
people and replacing it by  
something in which there are  
bound to be gross numbers of  
hungry and cast-away people.  

On the Miskito Indians —  
The Sandinista leadership admits  
to its inadequate and racist  
treatment of these Indians, but  
also asks us to realize two  
things: (1) that the Sandinistas  
did not invent this racism, but  
rather inherited it from the  
Spanish colonizers of Latin  
America, whose closest friends  
have been the Anglo colonizers  
of North America; and (2) that  
Nicaragua cannot be about its  
necessary business of working to  
end its own racism as long as the  
U.S. is waging an undeclared war  
on Nicaragua.  

On women: Nicaraguan  
society, including its Sandinista  
leadership, is sexist. The female  

leadership is aware of this and  
angry, for example, about the  
draft law which exempts  
women. However, the gains that  
have been made for women since  
the 1979 victory have been  
many: giving women property  
rights; establishing paternity  
responsibility; extending rights  
of decision in child-rearing to  
women as well as men; and,  
most of all, having created a  
socio-economic climate in which  
children do not die of malnutri-  
tion and inadequate health care.  
First World feminists need to be  
careful about laying our experi-  
ences and concrete goals on  
women in other cultures. At the  
same time, neither we here in  
the U.S., whatever our color/cul-  
ture, nor our sisters elsewhere, can  
afford to “overlook” the  
liberation of women as a funda-  
mental aim of the revolutionary  
process. Sandinista women and  
those of us U.S. women on this  
visit were in agreement about  
this.  

On gays: We were told that  
this is a “non-issue” and, simply,  
that there are no laws against  
homosexuality. Given the pre-  
dominant Spanish/Catholic cul-  
ture of Nicaragua, no less sexist  
and heterosexist than other Wes-  
tern cultures, Nicaragua seems to  

be at a critical turning point  
in its theopolitical treatment of  
homosexuals, and of all matters  
relating to sex and gender.  
Nicaragua (1) could become, like  
Cuba, a nation in which gay men  
and lesbians are unacceptable  
participants in public life; or (2)  
could endeavor to build a  
society in which the common  
good is not cemented in gender-  
roles and particular family con-  
stellations. The former option is,  
to this point, normative in most  
capitalist and socialist societies.  
The latter would involve some-  
thing new in terms of revolu-  
tionary social transformation. It  
seems to me unlikely insofar as  
Nicaragua’s people must struggle  
to maintain a stable social order  
in face of massive external  
threat.  

On my meeting in the  
Tegucigalpa (Honduras) airport  
with “a close friend of Tacho’s”:  
The man wished to talk to me,  
did not wish to tell me his name,  
but introduced himself as “a  

close friend of Tacho’s (former  

Nicaraguan dictator, Anastasio  
Somoza).” “He was a greedy  
man,” this stranger spoke of  
Somoza. “But you must tell  

your people that his family was  
lovely. A family of generous,  
caring people, whose name has  
been marred by one man.” This  
stranger’s lament was for a  

country that has “fallen prey to  
the Communists” because one  
man, Somoza, turned out to be  
such a “greedy man.” “Toward  
the end, even I, who was his  
friend, was against him. Ninety-  
nine percent of us were against  
him,” he asserted. “But I feared  
this would happen. Somoza was  
so bad and had brought the  
country to such shambles that  
his replacement, whoever they  
were, were bound to be even  
worse.” “And what is your hope  
now, for your country?” I asked  
this man, having learned from  
him that he is living in exile in a  
neighboring country. “I want to  
return to my country, of  
course,” “Do you think this will  
be possible?” I continued. “I  
hope so,” he said, “and I think  
so, with the help of your Presi-  
dent Reagan. Unless you Ameri-  
cans re-elect him next year,  
however, my country may be  
doomed.”  

On Reagan: The Sandinis-  
tas, as well as the campesinos  
and people’s church members  
with whom we spoke, view  
Reagan and current U.S. policy  
as the source of their problems:  
a “warmonger,” “the leader of  
the rich against the poor,” the  
bearer of bad-will and evil  
against all that is truly free, just,  
good. The contra leadership with  
whom we spoke, together with  
other opponents to the Sandinis-  
ta government, view Reagan  
as a savior, without whom  
Nicaragua, in the words of the  
exile in the Tegucigalpa airport,  
“may be doomed.”  

On the Kissinger Commis-  
sion: Both the Sandinistas and  
leaders of the political opposi-  
tion to the government in  
Honduras (with whom we met  
in Tegucigalpa) were outraged  
by Kissinger himself and by  
most members of this Commis-  
sion. Rita Delia Casco, former  
Ambassador to the U.S. (during  
Carter's last year in office),  
spoke candidly with us: “Under  
the pretext of dialogue, your  
government sends a group like  
the Kissinger Commission, which  
informs us that either we will do  
things your way or be destroy-  
ed,” she recounted. “They were  
to be a fact-finding body. Pre-  
sumably, their role was to listen,  
But all they did was talk to us  
about our ‘lack of freedom,’ our  

Published Every Six Weeks in Vermont  

being a ‘closed society,’ our  

being ‘unwilling to listen to  

anyone but communists.’ And  

when Comandante Ortega finally  
got up to speak, Mr. Kissinger  
removed his earphones, and we  
heard one of the Commission  
members say to another, ‘Stop  
listening to this son-of-a-bitch.’”  

On Honduras: We were in  
Tegucigalpa and its surrounds (as  
far northwest as La Paz) for two  
days prior to our trip to Mana-  
gua. While there, we met with  
leaders of various human rights  
and labor organizations; journa-  
lists; a Honduran colonel (head  
of public relations for the  
military); several of U.S. Ambas-  
sador Negroponte’s assistants;  
the head of COHEP (private  

enterprise organization); and  
Indalecio Rodriguez, one of the  
directors of the FDN (Nicara-  
guan Democratic Front, the  
Honduran base of the contra  
movement). My impressions:  
that Honduras is fast-becoming  
a U.S. Marine base; that, with  
the intensified U.S. presence,  
repression against the poor and  
those who oppose U.S. policy is  
increasing; that, although mild  
by Guatemalan/Salvadoran stan-  
dards, the incidence of torture,  
disappearances and the virtual  
“build-up of a Police State” is on  
the rise; that, for us U.S. women  
sympathetic to the revolutionary  
process in Central America,  
Honduras was a scary place to  
be.  

On why the U.S. does not  
wish to tolerate (1) the Sandinis-  
tas; (2) revolutionary activities  
in Salvador or Guatemala; (3)  
Honduran activists who oppose  
military build-up in Honduras:  
Put simply, we cannot tolerate  
having neighbors who do not  
wish to be economically depen-  

dent on us; politically unaligned  
with us; and philosophically  
divergent from us. As Jeanne  
Kirkpatrick has noted, “It is in  
our interests [economic/politi-  
cal] to follow the course we are  
on in Central America.” Just as  
it has been in the Philippines,  
South Africa, Chile and else-  
where in the so-called “develop-  
ing” world. The problem, from  
the perspective of the U.S.  
government, is not “violations of  
human rights” (which are infin-  
itely more flagrant in El Salva-  
dor than in Nicaragua) and it is  
not “Soviet imperialism” (These  
nations may turn reluctantly to  
the Soviet sphere for help only  
when they are under the gun of  
U.S. imperialism). The problem  
is that each of these small  
nations, in its own way and in its  
own turn, is struggling to build  
a mixed economy (with both  
socialist and capitalist ingre-  
dients); to remain unaligned in  
relation to both superpowers; to
