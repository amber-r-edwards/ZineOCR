EATUIRIES  
HAIR: To Shave or Not to Shave  

By Dian Kendrick Mueller  

(The following is a  
conversation about hair held by  
a group of women. Some names  
have been changed to protect  

the shy.)  
DIAN: I remember when I  
was in junior high school I  
shaved my arms, which is the  
one time in my whole life I’ve  
ever done that.  

ELLEN: You mean under  
your arms.  

DIAN: No, no, my actual  
arms. I did it because I have hair  
on my arms, and it’s not that  
nice, soft, blond down that some  
people have, it’s black hair. And,  
you know, romantic heroines in  
movies and popular girls in  
school did not have black hair all  
over their arms. So at one point  

I got desperate enough to shave  
my arms, and then when the hair  
grew back it was all stubbly and  
rough — it was awful. Well, I  
lived through that and I didn’t  
do it again and I don't worry  
about it too much anymore.  

I started shaving my legs and  
under my arms when I was  
about 14. I remember I was  
taking a bath and I looked at my  
legs and I thought they looked  
just like spider’s legs and I was  
so distraught; I thought they  
really looked terrible. And so I  
shaved them, and I really sliced  
myself up in the process, too —  
you know how you nick  
yourself and the blood runs and  
all that stuff? And so for years  
and years I kept that up — I'd  
shave myself once a week. Then  
a few years ago I thought, ‘Now  
what in the hell am I doing this  
for?” and so I haven't shaved for  
a long time, but I have this  
feeling that if I should ever want  
to wear shorts or a short skirt  
again I wouldn't do it if I had  

hair on my legs. I’d shave my  
legs or else I wouldn’t wear a  
short skirt. I haven’t reached the  
point yet where I can expose my  
hairy legs to the world.  

ELLEN: Try going for a job  
with hairy legs! I have a funny  
story about legs and underarms.  

JENNIFER: I had a friend  
who did the same thing your  
mother did and she didn’t feel  
clean unless she shaved under  
her arms. I started shaving my  
legs and underarms when I was a  
teenager and then in my late  
years in high school I started  

When I started shaving my legs  
and underarms I was a teenager.  
Then when I went off to  
Berkeley to become a hippy, I  
stopped shaving. I went home to  
visit my mother — and my  
mother always shaved under her  
arms, but she never shaved her  
legs; she had really nice legs — so  
I came home, and she noticed I  
had hair under my arms and she  
said, “Ellen, what are you doing  
with hair under your arms?  
What's the matter with you?”  
And I said, “Well, you don’t  
shave your legs.” And she said,  
“Oh, but my legs are nice.” And  
so we finally worked it out that  
I liked hair under my arms and  
she liked hair on her legs so  
everything was cool.  

I was getting really sick of it and  
thinking about how stupid it  
was, getting cut up and all. And  
I had eczema and it bothered  
my skin, so why bother your  
skin that's sensitive? In college,  
I just stopped shaving altogether.  

ANN: I remember an example  
of how ridiculous it is to shave  
legs. When I was in high school,  
I used to do a lot of camping, like  
for two or three days at a time.  
I remember one time I was  
camping and there were these  
women, out in the rustic woods,  
with their backpacks and just  
the essential things, and they  
were down by the brook with  
their soap and razors, shaving  
their legs — on a camping trip! I  
mean, who cares?  

JOY: My first experience was  
when I was in the sixth grade —  
I was about 12. My best friend  
and I went up into my bedroom  
and we did the peroxide trip,  
which was to spread hydrogen  
peroxide all over our legs,  
figuring the hair would turn  
blond. Well, nobody told us  
about the incredible itching  
sensation you get from peroxide.  
We started stamping our feet and  
running around the room — it  
was torture. Finally, I couldn't  
stand it anymore and I started  
scratching my legs and I had  
these big, red welts all up and  
down my legs. And I don’t even  
think our hair turned blond after  
all that. You put yourself  
through this torture because you  
think the hair doesn’t belong  
there.  

ELLEN: One of the things  
that really surprised me after  
coming out of the subculture  
that I lived in for such a long  
time in Berkeley was coming to  
Vermont and finding women  
who shaved under their arms. I  
mean I could somewhat  
understand women shaving their  
legs if they had straight jobs or  
something, but to shave under  
their arms really flipped me out,  
because the only people who see  
hair under your arms are like  
lovers, or people that you live  
with, or people you're really close  
to. I really think that hair under  
women’s arms is wonderful and  
it’s very soft and I also think it’s  
very sexy and sensual. And I  
could not understand why  
women who didn’t shave their  
legs shaved under their arms — it  
really freaked me out.  

NANCY: When I was young,  
it was completely the opposite.  
When you wore sleeveless shirts,  
you were for sure not supposed  
to see hair — that had to be  
shaved.  

DIAN: Or a strapless formal?  
Wearing a strapless formal with  
hair under your arms just didn’t  
make it.  

NANCY: I think a parallel to  
this is deodorant. The smell that  
you get, people try to cover that  
up and then if you have hair —  
obviously hair and odor go  
together.  

ANN: Yeah. A lot of women  
say that the reason that they  
shave under their arms is because  
of smell.  

ELLEN: But another thing  
about shaving that we've already  
talked a little bit about is that  
whenever you shave, unless you  
shave every day you feel it, and  
it really doesn’t feel nice at all.  

It’s not sensual to be with  
somebody whose legs or  
underarms are prickly. And they  
are when you shave and it  
doesn’t feel sensual at all.  
JENNIFER: Of course a lot  
of women use depilatories.  
ELLEN: But even those you  
have to use real often.  
ANN: And they’re dangerous.  
BYMMY: I was on a swim  
team in high school, and in my  
senior year I decided to stop  
shaving. I'd had it with shaving  
and I was starting to read  
feminist literature and seeing the  
politics of shaving and I decided  
I didn’t want to go through all  
that shit just to be acceptable, so  
I stopped shaving. Then my  
swimming coach told me that I  
should start shaving again, and I  
said, “Well, none of the men  
shave," and he said, “Well, do  
you want to be a man?” I got a  
lot of hassle from him about  
looking downright shitty at  
swim meets, and he'd say,  
“Come on, why don’t you just  
go home and shave? It’s not  
going to hurt you.” And he  
would hassle me about it  
regularly, and so I finally gave in

CONVERSATION:  

FEMINIST THERAPY  

By Dian Kendrick Mueller  

(The following is a  
conversation between Dian  
Kendrick Mueller, a member of  
the Commonwoman collective,  
and two therapists at Networks  
in Burlington — Diane Gottlieb  
and Edie Israel. This is part of a  
continuing series on feminist  
therapy.)  

DIANE GOTTLIEB: I am a  
therapist and I am a feminist.  
It's easier to define being a  
therapist, which is somebody  
who works with people and tries  
to help them get in touch with  
some of their choices, get in  
touch with their strengths,  
sometimes get in touch with  
their pain, and work on  
unresolved issues. Being a  
feminist has been an issue in my  
life for years, since back in  
1966. In 1966, I was at the  
University of Wisconsin and it  

was during the anti-war days and  
the men I was involved with at  
the time were struggling with the  
issues of the draft and a group of  
women got together, recognizing  
that the draft wasn’t going to  
directly affect them, but that  
there was an indirect effect.  

We got a group of women  
together to talk about how we  
felt and what we wanted to do  
about the draft. That was the  
first time I was involved in direct  
consciousness raising or  
identifying the issues as being  
different for men than for  
women — out loud and in an  
organized way. We ended up  
looking at what it means to be a  

woman in our society which  
wasn’t directly being addressed  
out loud at that time.  

DIAN KENDRICK  
MUELLER: I think that's the  
way a lot of women got into  
feminism. Many women were  
involved with the peace  

movement and with student  
freedom and so forth and came  
to resent the position they held  

in peace groups or student  
groups. They came to resent  
doing the mimeographing,  

getting the coffee, being the sex  
object — whatever was needed  
by the men in order for the men  
to survive.  

EDIE ISRAEL: Probably  
when it really hit me was when  
I went to New York to study  
dance in 1968. At that point  
most of the choreographers were  
male and most of the dancers  
were female. I had to deal with  
how I felt about that, and I  
started organizing with other  
women to form our own troupe.  

DIANE: I've spent a long time  
thinking about “What is feminist  
therapy?” This is partially  
because for years in the  
Burlington area I have been one  
of the people who have been  
associated with the women’s  

movement who is also doing  
therapy.  

DIAN: Are you  
psychotherapists, psychologists,  
psychiatrists?  

EDIE: I’m a dance therapist.  

DIANE: I’m a social worker.  
Both of us have master’s degrees.  

EDIE: And in this setup (at  
Networks) we've all shared a lot  
of skills with each other. So  
while I’m trained as a dance  
therapist, I do a lot of verbal  
interaction, too.  

DIANE: And I do movement  
work, too, so we've both learned  
from each other.  

DIAN: To get back to  
feminist therapy — what do you  
think about that?  

DIANE: I take into account  
the economic, role-structure  
system that happens in our  
society. What I mean by that is  
what is expected of women, of  
men? What is expected by  
society in terms of jobs, in terms  
of roles, in terms of all the  
expectations that have been put  
on us? I examine what kind of  
power women have been taught  
that they’re allowed to have or  
not have. I look at the choices  

and where there aren't choices —  
what is our relationship to  
competition, to money, to  
decision making, what does it  
mean to give up some of the  
power in the house? All of these  
issues are things I bring into  
therapy when I’m working with  
not only women, but men and  
women, or families.  

The other main issue that  
comes up for me is allowing  
people to feel that they have  
choices, within the confines of  
our society, within the confines  
of the economy, and helping  
them to realize some of those  
choices. If in fact someone  
decides to go out and have a  
profession that’s a choice, or if  

someone decides their profession  
is staying at home, that’s a  
choice.  

The other thing that comes up  
a lot, especially with women, is  
that women feel powerless, and  
part of the work we do here is  
helping women get in touch with  
their own personal power and  
learning ways to use it.
