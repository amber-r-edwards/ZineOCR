| Commonwoman would like to publish an issue on sexuality. We'd like it  
to reflect the complicated and sometimes contradictory ideas and feelings  
concerning eroticism, passion, pornography, anti-pornography, sadomaso-  
chism, lesbianism, heterosexuality, bisexuality, butch-femme relationships,  
bestiality... How do we evolve a feminist ethic/aesthetic around sexuality?  
We want your stories, poems, essays, erotic fantasies..., and what about the  
centerfold? Some good catalyst material are the June ’82 issue of off our  
backs, the Heresies sex issue, Susan Griffin's Pornography and Silence.  

Send typewritten double spaced manuscripts, B&W cartoons, graphics  
and photos to Commonwoman, Box 242, Winooski, Vermont.

on the collective is paid for her work.

Dear Sisters:  

I am thoroughly enjoying our  
exchange sub with Commonwoman.  
I really love to be in contact with  
feminists across the country involved  
in writing and generating new ideas.  

But I had to write to you about  
Linda Wittenberg’s front page article  

' rlatawrn gs.) 282) entitled “Compu-  
terland is Coming.” I understand  

and identify with her hatred of  
regimentation. However, I think she’s  
confused computers with their mis-  
use,  

If I had to work all day in front  
of somebody else’s VDT doing  
pointless, boring work, I wouldn’t  
like it very much. Instead, we have a  
microcomputer that I can use as I  
please, and I love it.  

I have not found that it makes  
me less creative, nor that I use it to  
avoid solving my own problems.  
Instead, it’s made it possible for me  
to write more, and organize better!  

We have a word processing  
program and I swear it’s changed my  
life. Now I can rewrite and rewrite to  
my heart’s content and not have to  
retype and retype (the line printer  
does it for me.) I can spend more  
time interviewing people, doing  
research and thinking of the most  
effective, creative way to express  
what I mean rather than typing. I no  
longer put off writing letters, either.  

I used to have to type labels for  
our Free Press subscriptions and our  
local Community Festival minutes  
every time I turned around. Now I  
can press a few buttons and presto!  
new label in zip code order, no less.  

In addition to this, I can do the  
Free Press advertising billing on it, a  
chore that used to take me about  
four hours, in less than an hour! We  
also are able to help other good  
organizations get things done: the  
Tenants Union and the Women’s  
Action Collective (a radical women's  
umbrella group, including Women  
Against Rape) are putting their  
mailing lists on our computer for  
free, And we're doing jobs for money  
for a number of other organizations  
— which helps them and us.  

Technology is not the problem,  
it's how people use it and who  
controls it,  

Love,

Arson at GCN  

To the Editor:  

The terrible fire on July 7  
devastated the Gay Community News  
(GCN) offices. Several people had to  
be rescued from fire escapes, but  
fortunately there were no injuries.  
Despite the loss of vital equipment  
and files, GCN published the first  
issue of its tenth year on schedule on  
Saturday, July 10.  

Both the Boston City Arson  
Squad and federal agents from the  
Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms divi-  
sion of the Treasury Department are  
investigating the fire. Although  
neither agency is willing to make a  
statement yet, we believe that the  
fire started as a result of arson: arson  
for profit or arson for political  
vengeance,  

GCN has been the victim of  
anti-gay attacks throughout its his-  
tory, including numerous break-ins,  
bullets through our windows, vandal-  
ism, and the mysterious death of  
GCN News Reporter David Brill in  
1979. However, with the support of  
our community we become ever  
more determined to struggle on in  
the face of each new attack.  

We are gratified to say that the  
community response to the fire thus  
far, both in Boston and across the  
country, has been immediate and  
generous. Several benefits have  
already taken place and more are  
planned in such far-reaching places as  
New York, San Francisco, Chicago,  
Philadelphia, and Provincetown. But  
we urgently need more help. GCN’s  
initial fund-raising goal is $100,000;  
this money is needed for a new office  
as well as for equipment, the recon-  
struction of archives and records, and  
other emergency expenses.  

Please help us continue this  
tradition of excellence. Your contri-  
bution of $1000 or $100 or $10 —  
whatever you can give — will help us  
rebuild.  

There's no one else we can turn  
to. Thank you.  

The GCN Board  
of Directors

Editor’s Response  

Dear Roz:  

Your question was “Did Common-  
woman edit out a photo of an  
Israeli woman holding a sign about  
the PLO?" We checked with every-  
one in layout and editorial commit-  
tees and no one knows of any such  
photo.

Dear Commonwomen:  

The September issue of Com-  
monwoman is excellent — lots of  
information, humor, ideas and poli-  
tics.. Thank you! I am proud to be a  
subscriber and look forward to issue  
no. 5.  

One criticism, however. Please  
give credit where credit is due. The  
illustration on page 10 is not credited  
and it comes directly from the Hand-  
book for Women on the Nuclear  
Mentality. The woman who drew it,  
Valarie Page, contributed her time  
and talent free and deserves recogni-  
tion too,  

I am enclosing a copy of a  
statement that was presented at a  
recent hearing in White River Junc-  
tion on the proposed opening of an  
“adult bookstore.” The town has  
granted parking spaces with the  
understanding that the “bookstore”  
will attract customers after the  
normal “peek” business hours. The  
next step is a permit for a theatre to  
operate within the bookstore, and we  
all know what that means. Women  
Against Nuclear Development is  
coordinating its activities with the  
Vermont Coalition Against Domestic  
Violence to, at minimum, make the  
connection between violence in our  
everyday lives and the pornographic  
industry.  
Thanks for your work on  
Commonwoman!  
Best,  
Nina Swain  

P.S. In the past we have asked  
that any material used from the  
Handbook, be given credit in the  
following manner: Where it’s from  
authors' names (Susan Koen and Nina  
Swain), full title (Handbook for  
Women on the Nuclear Mentality),  
and where copies can be obtained  
(ask your local bookstore, or send  
$4.00 to WAND, Box 801, Norwich,  
VT 05055). The third edition of the  
Handbook was printed in August and  
has been enlarged and revised, thus  
the increase from $3.00 to $4.00.  

Help Anna Kissed is in  
trouble. Her ex-husband  
has served her with two  
counts of child stealing  
and extradition to Cal.  
in an attempt to gain  
custody of her two girls.  
Despite a history of his  
abusive behavior, she is  
in trouble because she is  
a transient political dyke,  
“not mother material.”  
Anyone who can offer  
supportive info, energy,  
legal advice or money,  

please call Laie 363-3536.
