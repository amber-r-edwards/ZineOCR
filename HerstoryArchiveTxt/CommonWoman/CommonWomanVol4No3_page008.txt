I always knew I wanted to  
have one or two children and  
adopt one or two others. When I  
envisioned myself doing this, it  
was always with the hope that I  
would have a well-established  
career and some form of finan-  
cial security. I didn’t set any age  
limit on myself, but I told  
myself that I could “wait” to  
have children. Well, it didn’t  
happen that way. When I got  

pregnant, I didn’t have a job  
because I had been fired. Not  
only that, but I didn’t know  

much of anyone in New York  
City where I was and I was  
scared and unprepared for child-  
birth.

I thought about abortion  
for a while and looked at news-  
paper ads for abortions. The  
conclusion I came to was that  
abortion is not always the  
answer for a pregnant woman  
who is poor and struggling,  
especially if she wants a child. I  
sometimes regret being a  
mother; there are/were times  

when I hate(d) it, especially in  
the beginning. The first six  
months were a drag. This little  
creature depended on me for  
everything — food, clothing,  
shelter — everything. It was fun  
and sensual/sexual when she  
nursed, but it was not fun to  
scrimp for endless bills and  
sometimes live on rice and  
potatoes for a month because I  
didn’t have the money for food  
stamps. It was not fun to be  
continually tired and to live  
around people that I had very  
little I could share with. It was  
not fun to have only an hour a  
week off childcare, so I could go  
to the library and read.  
Motherhood as it is con-  
ceived in our society is totally  
unreal and it shows itself in  
ruptured relationships and trou-  
bled children all over this  
country. Men are continually  
giving women the line that  
mothering is the single most  
important thing that a woman  
can do and that just ain’t so.  
Motherhood is important, but so  
is fatherhood. Most women are  
forced to “be there” for child-  
ren. Oftentimes, the father tries  
to start a relationship with the  
kids when the kids are teenagers  
and more interested in the  

outside world and their own  
bodies than in being Daddy’s  
grown-up babies. Besides, being  
a parent is for women, not for  
men, or so most men seem to  
think.

Then, of course, there is the  
problem that mothers are to  
blame for whatever is wrong  
with their children or wards.  
This goes from having problems  
relating to the outside world to  
intrapsychic problems. The truth  
is society sets up expectations of  
the mother/child bond that no  
one can meet. No one can be  
all-giving, all-sweet, and there to  
meet anyone’s every need, yet  
this is expected of all mothers,  
regardless of their personalities.

A single mother’s bind goes  
a little further than that, though.  
A single mother is more likely to  
be poor than a single father,  
which means she probably can’t  
afford to hire a housekeeper to  
live in and take care of the kids  
as my father did after my  
mother died and before my  
stepmother moved in. It’s true  
money doesn’t solve everything,  
but it sure does help with some  
basics, like enough food, enough  
clothes and a decent place to  
live for oneself and one’s  
child(ren).

X X Alix with

Women’s Music is something  
special! Concerts have come to  
mean more by the innovative  
ways they have been opened up  
to women in the form of child-  
care provided and having inter-  
preters for the hearing-impaired.

The performers are talented  
women we have come to know,  
and as they enter our lives, there  
will be one or two we choose as  
our personal favorite. It might  
be because of the rhythm of the  
music or the rhyme of the  
words, and even the personality  
and appearance of the star  
herself. But when it comes to  
women’s music, the political  
views of the performer have a  
great deal to do with the choice.

When I first heard the music  
of Alix Dobkin it was the start  
of learning about a whole  
culture - I never would have  
guessed existed and the when  
and where of this is maybe why  
I feel so strongly about her. In  
the two years since her first  
album arrived at my home, I had  
only heard her at the Michigan  
Womyn's Festival. So when a  
chance came to see her doing a  
benefit for Elizabeth Stone  
House in Boston, I of course  
went. Performing with Alix were  
Suzann Jessie Pearl, formerly of  
the Berkeley Women’s Music  
Collective, and Davida Ishatova  
(Goodwoman), and interpreter  
Aileen O'Neill. They managed to  
raise $1500 for this important  
center.

Like the warm hand of  
friendship, the bond between  
artists and audience was almost  
overwhelming. Alix’s music  
showed the love and caring and  
pride that we all need in our  
lives.

When Alix speaks on sub-  
jects she feels are important,  
trying to point out our responsi-  
bility to see our differences and  
change ourselves so we can end  
the harm we do to each other,  
this, too, is her style of enter-  
taining.

But in using the stage to  
voice her views, it could become  
one-sided if Alix did not see it as  
her responsibility to open herself  
up and hear other women’s  
views. This is done when pro-  
ducers can arrange for a Gather-  
ing or Potluck on the day after  
the concert.

In Boston, it was a Gather-  
ing of two-and-a-half hours at  
the Summerville Women’s Cen-  
ter. The conversation was on  
various subjects, and since Alix  
had a ‘touch of laryngitis her  
lover, Denny Brown, helped  
answer questions. But Denny did  
more by helping it to stay a  
Gathering and not letting it  
become an interview.

I'm only writing about  
Alix’s views, because I failed to  
take notes and the names of  
those there. Not that they  
weren't equally important.

Alix still feels it important  
that she is identified as a lesbian  
separatist, that the unspoken  

A mother needs to feel good  
about herself before she can be a  
good parent. If you’re stuck all  
day, every day with a child and  
no chance to nurture yourself,  
the consequences for parent and  
child can be very bad to tragic.  
Why aren’t we taught to be  
decent parents? Why can’t every  
woman, child and man assume  
the basics of life: decent food,  
shelter and clothing? It seems  
like the profit motive overrides  
all these concerns. Why is  
welfare attacked as a waste when  
the military budget is the largest  
share of the tax dollar? There  
are people, and I am one of  
them, who lack the circum-  
stances to be able to earn their  
living and their children’s at  
work they find meaningful. So, I  
do housecleaning, which uses  
little of my capacity, but house-  
cleaning is better than being  
alone in an apartment with a  
child all the time.

One thing that is vital to all  
single parents (especially  
mothers who can’t afford to pay  
for childcare) is to build a  
network of friends who will  
exchange or do childcare for and  
with them. I am involved with  
other single mothers in coopera-  
tive childcare and it’s a lifesaver.

Love  

myth is one of a lesbian who  
never, ever chooses to deal with  
men and who expects all women  
to do the same. But, for her, the  

meaning of separatism is “a  
consciousness, an analysis, and a  
commitment to the well-being  
and best interest of women in  
general and lesbians in particu-  
lar.” She spoke of her family  
and her daughter and the men  
and boys who are a part of her  
life.

Alix also spoke about why  
Women Only events are impor-  
tant, knowing that other per-  
formers want to open their  
concerts to men because they  
feel that they can reach more  
women and a larger audience for  
their music this way. If we want  
Women Only, then we should  
say so to producers and perfor-  
mers.

What Alix feels is that we  
have just begun to understand  
what it means and how precious  
and different our time in Women  
Only spaces is, and that it is  
self-defeating to characterize  
such spaces as ‘closed.’ An  
event may be “closed” from a  
man's perspective, but not from  
a woman’s.

Alix sees how frustrating it  
is to see obstacles that keep us  
from this “wholesome, healing  
and liberating and yet often  
devalued” space. The obstacles  
are caused by guilt of those who  
do not understand the necessity  
of Women Only spaces and

MMONWOMAN MAY, 1981  

I may not get to do what I want  
all the time, but I get to do it  
more than I used to: We all need  
breaks from work and childcare  
is no different.  
I wish that more commun-  
ity organizations would sponsor  
childcare for whatever events  
they have when it’s not appro-  
priate for young children to be  
there. It discriminates against  
poor women like me who cannot  
always find or pay for childcare  
when events go on that they  
would like to attend. And it  
hurts to be asked to leave when I  
attend an event hoping my  
young daughter won't get too  
restless or “noisy” so that I can  
go to whatever event I want to  
go to. All too often, it doesn’t  
work and I have to leave or not  
attend at all. And my life is  
poorer for the lack of oppor-  
tunity I face as a poor, working  
mother.

“who measure it according to  
the absence of men” instead of  
by the good it does for women.

On her views about little  
boys coming to Women Only  
spaces, she talked about prob-  
lems she has had with their  
mothers and she wanted it  
known that she does not hate  
little boys. But the fact is there  
are few Women Only spaces and  
little girls want time away from  
boys, too. Alix wondered if it is  
good to teach boys they have  
the right to go anywhere they  
please, with no regard for the  
wants and needs of women and  
girls, and if this might not also  
teach them to see lesbians as  
their enemy. She wondered  
whether this view comes from  
their mother not understanding  
why we need Women Only  
spaces.

As Alix talked, it was clear  
she is very opinionated and does  
not change her mind easily. But  
what she believes she is willing  
to back up with action or with  
words or music.

Her style and manner may  
cause some women to step back  
from her, but not to be unaffect-  
ed.

In ending my article, I add  
this:

Wouldn’t it be better to  
have a “star” that causes the  
interaction of growth in us by  
feeling and thinking, than a  
“comet” that rushes by leaving  
nothing but a bright glow to  
remember? I believe Alix Dob-  
kin is a star in the best sense!
