forward a few steps and repeats

gigantic mosquitoes so that my
first instinct was to smash the

big buggers, but they’re vegeta-
rians, they don’t bite, and they’re
extremely graceful when not
trapped inside a car, but in an
environment which doesn’t inhi-
bit the slow and flowing move-
ments of their thready legs. One
afternoon on a mountainside I
found a pale yellow cranefly
with indigo blue, bulging eyes in
the tall wet grass and wild
mustard. I wanted to take a
close look at her, so I lifted her
in my hands, but much to my
dismay her legs came off so
easily I must have injured her
beyond repair with my rough
touch. I placed her back in the
grass, crippled, and left that spot
feeling clumsy and guilty. On
my way back down the moun-
tain I was pulled towards a
sunny patch in the dense woods
and spread my jacket on the
damp ground close to a tree
stump very nearly claimed again
by the earth. Balancing straight
up in a sculpted garden of moss
and rain-soaked fungus was the
pupa of a cranefly — emerging,
transparent, pulsing, nearly out
of her protective covering except
for her gangly legs, the last to be

freed. I witnessed her birth in
my hand, knowing I wasn’t
to damage her body if I

remains of the pupal skin she
was still attached to. I placed her
back on the stump after watch-
ing her come most of the way
out so she would be in familiar
territory when she took her first
steps. To my satisfaction she had
all six legs (I counted them as I
would the toes of a baby), and
in the course of writing about
her she dried off in the sun and
disappeared into the world to
meet her fate and make her
choices like the rest of us.
Amazed, grateful, the cranefly

spirit in me was certainly reawa-
kened when I somehow led
myself to this magic spot in the
woods to witness a fresh new
start and absorb a lesson in
gentleness.

I would like to imagine that
I could plunk myself down in
any one of dozens of spots on
some grassy hillside and by so
doing create again and again a
room of my own vaulted by sky
and brimming with details. If
each room had a decipherable
message from the bugs that I
could figure out how to save the
planet by opening my pores and
analyzing the data. My obser-
vations would not be controlled
as they are in a traditionally
patriarchal laboratory. As a
matter of fact I would have to
learn not to regret that I could
never return to that very same
place when the field is June high
to a bug’s eye and the clouds are
shaped in just that perfect way.

(Continued from Page 6)

For instance, one of my
clients was quite clear that her
father’s sexual play with her had
hurt her, made her furious and
distrustful of men. What she
didn’t realize before coming to
therapy was that her reaction
was not just to men but to

everyone; that she felt as power-
less in adult close relationships
as she had felt when she was her
father’s 6-year-old sexual toy.

As she became clearer on
this, she saw various power
maneuvers that she was accus-
tomed to using with people,
especially men. Whether or not
she would decide to stop using
these tactics, she at last knew
why she was “that way.” And
another reason to be that way
follows.

In a recent presentation on
“Child Sexual Abuse,” Lauren
Berrizbetia made the important
point that the other part of the
trauma is the mother’s abandon-
ment of the little girl to her
father’s invasion (consciously or
unknowingly). My client also
felt this very strongly and
attributed it to her mother’s
own depression or to being
unlovable herself. These are

serious issues to be worked
through.

However, she came to rea-
lize that she also attributed her
mother’s abandonment to a
power split in the family and in
the world at large: “men exert
power/ women do not.” She
therefore did not want to be a
woman and was quite filled with
self-hate, which emerged in a
variety of ways. (The other side
of the coin was several other
women I worked with who had
so-called “hysterical” symptoms
in the place of exerting power or
autonomy. They felt that this
was the only way “to be a
woman” and only while slowly
giving up these ways did they
realize the degree of self-hate
that had been involved.)

As for my client — had we
only discussed her family’s
dynamics we might have accom-
plished a lot. But the crucial
work, I feel, was discussing the
position of women in the world
which her family only epitomized
to her. If only her parents
had seemed totally abnormal to
her, but no — they seemed
almost the norm to which she
too as an adult woman would
have to conform.

A previous counselor had
suggested that my client projected

world at large. But she could not

you should not be happy to stay
home and do those things
because you're following the
stereotype, you're subjugating
yourself to others, you're a
servant to your family. And yet,
at the same time, feminists are
also saying that
about women as opposed to men
is that women are nurturing,
that women care about the
quality of life. So that’s really
rather confusing. In my case,
I do get pleasure out of cooking
a good meal, or baking some-

suppose that must be part of the
way you feel, too.

BOBBI: Yes. It’s a way of
giving of myself, rather than
going out to work and coming
home and giving a paycheck. It’s
also something that is unique to
each person that does it. I guess
almost anyone could go out and
get some kind of work and bring
in a paycheck, but not everyone
can do the same things that you
as a woman can do in your own
home. And each woman does
things differently.

DIAN: And so in a way you
have more freedom by working
at home than you would by
working in the marketplace.

BOBBI: Yes. I've tried both,
and I prefer to be at home.

surmount her abused past and
self-image, without a political
perspective which reinforced her
perceptions.

The power imbalance
between men and women (both
in action and in self-image)
invades all child-rearing (even
the New York Times recognized
this in their March 22 Sunday
Magazine article on ‘Women and
Dependency”). I don’t think we

can understand family sexual
abuse, overcome its effects or
prevent its occurrence without
first seeing these power dyna-
mics in general, and then analyz-
ing their particular impact on
individual families and lives
(along with all the other emo-
tional dynamics that operate in
all of us).
