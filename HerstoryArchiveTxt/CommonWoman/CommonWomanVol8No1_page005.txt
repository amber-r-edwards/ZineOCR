Family Stories

By Jackie L. Berger

1933

My Aunt Mae met Uncle
Raul in Chicago. He was the
handsome Nicaraguan at the
university's International House
party. When Mae announced
she was to marry the boy as
soon as he graduated and move
to his country, the family was
enraged. As new immigrants and
Jews, my family must have
known the chain of their tradi-
tions and faith would be pre-
carious in this new country. But
for the first delicate link to be
broken so soon was too much.
Mae became a Catholic and so
her whole branch of the family
tree was “lost.”

1966

I got to take two weeks out
of school. I was six and had just
learned to pronounce the word,
“Nicaragua.” Aunt Mae’s daugh-
ter Carmen was to marry a
wealthy Nicaraguan man and all
of us were invited there for the
wedding. We practiced rolling
our r’s, Nicarrragua, Carrrmen.

Carmen was a grown-up, I
thought. She was eighteen and
thin as a model. Her pink crepe
dress, her white skin, her black
hair teased high and her heavily
made-up doe eyes made every-
one want to touch her. She was
kissed by one relative after
another. I remember wondering
why she wanted to kiss now
when she would have to kiss at
the wedding. At the reception
my mother said that was some
of the best champagne she'd ever

seen.

Nicaragua was a series of
dream segments collected on a
family vacation. One night my
brother David and I were left in
the care of some distant rela-
tives-by-marriage. I remember a
beautiful tiled hall and a sunken
living room. We watched tele-
vision in Spanish and laughed at
jokes we probably wouldn’t have
understood even in our own
language.

The countryside passed by
the window of our rented car.
Uncle Raul waved his arm over
an expanse of fields that
belonged to him. A tangle
of green came after the neat
rows ended. Then dirt streets
piled high with garbage,
and flies circled the heaps. In
an open market I saw a pig we
passed by and I was amazed. The
kids were dark and swelled with
poverty. I remember watching
one kid give another a piggyback
ride. The rider’s too small pants
exposed a brown butt, but it
didn’t seem funny here.

Even then there was an
undertow of tension. When
David got lost we spent one
whole day weeping in the police
station trying to cross the
language barrier. What if he
never turned up? I would be an
only child. We were going to
drive through town with a loud
speaker, but the system broke
down. David was a clever boy,
though, and remembered the
name of our hotel. Ten days
later the hotel was bombed. We
heard the news over the radio,
back in America.

1966

The next time we saw
Carmen was on television. She
was Miss Nicaragua in the Miss
Universe pageant. We called my
dad from the backyard when she
appeared on the screen. She
looked like a bride again.

Later the pageant photo-
graphs filled up the hallway of
the apartment Carmen shared
with her mother and son in Los
Angeles. Her handsome husband
had taken a mistress and Carmen
was considered a foolish girl for
complaining. The one-year
marriage was over, and his name
would be lost to her. She would
have lost custody of her baby had she remained in
Nicaragua. A boy child goes to
the father in the case of divorce.
So she smuggled her infant son
back to America in the middle
of the night like a criminal. Soon
after, my aunt flew out to join
her daughter and grandchild in
their new life.

1975

During the Passover seder at
our home each relative at the
table read from the Haggadah,
telling the story of freedom.
Uncle Raul, here on a visit, did
his best with a thick accent.

David and I looked at each
other, eyes rolled.
After dinner the family
discussed politics. Uncle Raul had
no kind words for the illegal
immigrants who poured into Los
Angeles each day from South
and Central America. They were
his workers back home. He had
grown rich off the labor of
interchangeable peasants who
picked clean the fields of his
coffee plantation. He told us
they don’t want to learn to read,
they are peasants, Jews fleeing
his Nicaraguan Egypt.

My relatives themselves had
been good immigrants, one
generation removed from the
peasants their parents were.

Ridding themselves of shame-
ful accents, they became good
students in the lessons of assimi-
lation, survival. They revealed
their real selves in private hours.
Jewish intellectuals, they had
scavenged their way to the
middle class. Now Uncle Raul’s
words made us all uncomfort-
able. Arguments flared, then
petered into gossip after Aunt
Mae, Uncle Raul, and Carmen
said goodnight.

1980

After the revolution, Uncle
Raul couldn't get out of Nicara-
gua. Aunt Mae, Carmen, and her
son Shermin lived in Miami now.
They sent letters to the relatives
begging for money when the
flow of income that Uncle Raul
had always sent suddenly stop-
ped. They informed us they
would lower their standard of
living. They would move from
their Coral Estates condo. Carmen
would go to public school.

Uncle Raul was an old man and
his safety was all that mattered,
they said. An aunt with political
connections would see what she
could do to get Uncle Raul out.
We knew in our hearts we were
helping the wrong side. Somoza
was a criminal and my uncle was
no saint. But family was more
important than morals.

Present

They are united at last, my
Aunt Mae and Uncle Raul. A
retired couple in Miami like so
many of their Jewish neighbors,
Shermin will leave for college
soon. Carmen has never remar-
ried. She lives with her aging
parents to whom she is devoted.

Gorpa Lox MEETS Goldilocks -

Subversive Dolls

By D. Maloney
(A synopsis of a report from The
Nation, Dec. 24, 1983 —
although this may sound true, it
is fiction.)

During the Christmas sea-
son, millions of Cabbage Patch
Doll “fakes” entered the U.S.
illegally.

The Immigration and
Naturalization Service ordered
that “all Cabbage Patch kids not
legally in the country be sum-
marily deported.”

But agents expected to have
trouble telling the real dolls
from the “fakes.” The main
identifying feature is the navel —
or the lack of — in the fake
dolls. And due to the lack of
female I.N.S. agents, it would be
impossible to do stomach search-
es of the millions of girl dolls.

The C.I.A. picked up on the
I.N.S.’s suggestion that the for-
gery could have been the slick
and professional work of the
K.G.B. (!)

The C.I.A. leaked copies of
a report titled “Operation Cab-
bage Patch” that concluded that
the fake dolls were of “Marxist-
Leninist” origin and that
millions were parachuted into
the U.S. at prearranged drop
points.

The C.I.A. theorized that
the doll drop was a plot to
undermine the U.S. economic
recovery by a “direct strike at
the Christmas buying season.”

According to a C.I.A. infor-
mant, the Commie scheme had
two stages. First, the dolls would
be infiltrated and sold; next, the
originators of the plan would
start a disinformation campaign
designed to cause parents to
demand refunds from Coleco
(the original Cabbage Patch Doll
maker).

The plan, of course, called
for spreading the rumor that the
children who sleep with the dolls
will contract AIDS.

What else; they haven't all been
willing to verbalize. How do you
manage around roommates,
children, visiting parents, or in
extreme cases like mine, neigh-
bors a quarter-mile away? Can
you manage to suppress the
sound effects and still have a
good time? I try when circum-
stances require, which they all
too often do, but with only
variable success. I wish people
would talk more about what
goes on for them; I am beginning
to think I have finally done it —
come up with a really unique
thing — except that I have run
into one other woman who is an
equally loud disturber of the
midnight peace. I am pretty
grateful to her for her piercing
shrieks, and wish a few more
would break the silence at least
verbally. Once I get this topic
sorted out, I can think of a cou-
ple of dozen more we all ought
to be talking about but never
seem to.

Drug Warning

Spread the word (excerpt from
Fullcircle)
ZOMAK — a drug used for
pain, including menstrual
cramps, was taken off the
market this summer. It was
found to cause severe allergic
reactions which resulted in the
deaths of five women. If you
have an old bottle of this drug
on your medicine shelf, return it
to the pharmacy or throw
it out.
