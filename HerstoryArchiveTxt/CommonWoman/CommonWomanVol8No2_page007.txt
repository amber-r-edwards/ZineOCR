I ride the city bus in Jeru-
salem looking at all the people. I
read the scars and wrinkles of
the old, the expressions of
determination and stubbornness
in the faces and gestures of the
adults, and the hopefulness in
the bright blue and brown-eyed
youth. I search these faces of
Jews who have come — North
Africa brown from Morocco,
Tunisia, Algeria, Libya, Egypt;
Semitic faces from Yemen,
Syria, Iran, Iraq, Turkey; from

Great Britain and the Medi-
terranean countries including
Spain, Portugal, France, Italy

and Greece. Blond and blue-eyed
Jews from Scandinavia, Holland,
Germany; from Poland and
Eastern Europe on through the
Soviet Union (where millions
still are not permitted to leave);
from India and even China (at
one time); from scattered Jewish
communities throughout the
continents of Asia, Africa, Aus-
tralia, and from most every
country in South, Central and
North America. I search these
faces looking for my own.
Searching for my own roots to
this tiny piece of semi-desert
land and for the meaning of my
ancestral and cultural links to
this internationally and racially
diverse people. Here I am, a U.S.
citizen. What is my connection to
all these people? I am amazed at
the leaps my ignorance, racism,
and culturally biased views must
make to accept myself as part of
the Jewish people.

Our Jewish lineage goes
back almost four thousand years
to Abraham, a member of one of
the many semi-nomadic tribes
living on this Middle Eastern
land. Abraham became the first
Jew (as our legends go) to
recognize the concept of one
God, thus separating himself and
his offspring from the other
pagan tribes. The Jewish people
lived in Palestine creating the
biblical kingdoms of Jerusalem,
and later were conquered by a
long series of empires. Even-
tually, around 70 A.D. they
were forced out of the land by
the Romans, and into exile and
dispersion, known as the “Dias-
pora.”

My eyes take in a view of
Jerusalem: the old city with its
generations of thick, now
greyed, stone walls; the new
city’s homes and buildings con-
structed of the same white
stone; and rocky hillsides nestled
with Arab and Bedouin villages
amongst patches of green and
the protruding white stone. I
remind myself of my history.
The Jewish people did not
choose to leave this land, they
were forced out. It has been in
these recent 2,000 years of
maintaining our Jewish identity
and culture, while living in
whichever countries would
tolerate us for unpredictable
amounts of time, that we have
taken on the characteristics of
each of these countries and they
have become a part of us.

I have come to Israel as a
traveler on a tourist visa for one
year, a tentatively privileged
Jew, crossing borders with a U.S.
passport. I look at this conglo-
meration of Israelis living and
struggling in their brand new and
ancient country. Many come to
Israel to live proudly their
Jewish culture and identity,
others as worn refugees of
Russian pogroms, Nazi holo-
caust, European ghettos, victims
of anti-Semitic outbursts world-
wide. Still others have come to
Israel with ideals and dreams of
returning to their homeland,
living on the land and building
an alternative Kibbutz commu-
nity. And of course many are
born here, Sabra Israelis. The
name Sabra is taken from a
native cactus fruit, prickly like a
porcupine on the outside and
sweet within.

I find no outward imme-
diate warmth or embrace that I,
another Jew in the Diaspora, have
finally found her way home
again, if only for a visit. Instead
I find a toughness, a coldness, a
pushing and shoving on buses, in
lines, a short-temperedness in
the market or in asking direc-
tions on the street. It’s no big
deal to be a Jew in this country.
No special bonding around going
to a Passover seder, closing your
business on Saturday instead of
Sunday, explaining to people
why you don’t celebrate Christ-
mas, or how you can be a Jew
but not be religious. Those are
all understood and accepted for
the most part, though politically
there are tensions and differ-
ences between religious and
secular Jews. The toughness and
rudeness of the Israeli is also
understood when you come to
see the hardships and pressures
that make up an Israeli’s daily
existence. Imagine needing to
constantly secure your borders
from potential military aggres-
sion. Every Israeli Jew is either a
soldier, will be a soldier or has
been a soldier, with the excep-
tion of married women and
certain religious groups. Imagine
living in a frightfully unstable
economy with a yearly inflation
of 200%, rising unemployment,
and major cutbacks of govern-
ment subsidies and social ser-
vices. Imagine being involved in
five major wars in a short
35-year history of statehood in
which no family has escaped
direct loss. Imagine occupying
territories in which the Pales-
tinians are rightfully angry,
and fearing the Arab extremist
group's goal of annihilation of
Israel. Imagine living in a coun-
try unified as Jews, but made up
of a wide variety of conflicting
cultural differences, values,
racial prejudices and attitudes.
Imagine having a country after a
long and recent history of being
scapegoated, and wanting to
shake the oppressive stereotypi-
cal images of Jews. Imagine
feeling the need and urgency of
self-determination for Jews,
competing with a high Arab
birth rate in Israel, and the
unresolved Arab-Jew tensions.
The Old Testament is the
basis of Jewish religion and is
also the roots of Christianity and
Islam. I think it’s important to
take note how these Bible
stories have led to creating the
myth that Jews and Arabs are
intrinsic enemies. When Abra-
ham’s wife Sarah could not
conceive a child, Abraham
fathered a son with Hagar, an
Egyptian servant girl of Sarah’s,
and named him Ishmael. When
God later blessed Sarah with the
miracle of birthing her son Isaac,
he promised both sons that they
would each father a great nation.
Ishmael is described as being
wild, free, untamed and against
everyone, while Isaac is said to
be the son with whom God
would fulfill his covenant with
Abraham. It is said that from
Isaac came the Jews and from
Ishmael came the Arabs. So in
this potent story, Abraham is
the father of both the Jews and
the Arab people, and God in a
sense pits the brothers against
each other by favoring Isaac.

In the late 18th century in
Europe, the modern Zionist
movement was begun by Jews
who held very little traditional
religious beliefs. The main goals
of Zionism were to achieve the
liberation and the normalization
of the Jewish people. The
unusual and complex situation
of the Jews being both a people
without a land and a religious
denomination was thought to be
solved by creating a Jewish
secular state. If the Jews had
their own country, their own
land and self-determination,
then freedom to practice reli-
gious Judaism would be ensured,
and the Jewish people would
no longer be refugees and
victims of anti-Semitic fascism
and massacres.

I had been taught growing
up that Jews are special people
and in general are humanistic,
intelligent, moral, philanthropic
and resourceful. Being in Israel
has shown me that Jews are like
people everywhere and contain
all the different values, elements
and ranges of personalities. The
creation of the State of Israel
and desire for the normalization
of the Jewish people, in my
opinion, has done just that. Now
Jews have a country that
includes all the complex prob-
lems and corruption as every
other country. We have our
share of Jewish thieves, rapists,
beggars and batterers, along with
our brilliant doctors, scientists,
artists, farmers, teachers and
loving family members. Israel
has achieved a ‘normalcy’ of
desiring the materialism and
values of the western world. It
has a ‘normal’ western demo-
cracy with a Declaration of
Independence that proclaims
equal rights for its minorities
and yet discriminates in its laws
and policies. We share emotional
and historical claims to the same
piece of land as the Palestinian
Arabs and our ‘normal’ govern-
ment seeks to solve these con-
flicts through military power,
while the majority of our
‘normal’ people are tired and
saturated with war. There is a
heavy pressure for sex roles to
remain traditional and emphasis
on the ‘normalcy’ of the nuclear
family.

I believe the Jewish people
(as all people) are entitled to
liberation and self-determina-
tion. As long as we are living in a
world of nation states and
borderlines, I believe it is abso-
lutely necessary for there to be a
Jewish homeland. Israel’s right
to exist continues to be a topic
of discussion. To me, this is
anti-Semitic and another exam-
ple of the out of proportion and
negative attention that Israel
receives. This does not mean
that I support the corrupt
decisions of the current Israeli
government. I would say the
same about the policies of most
governments in the world today,
and yet I do not hear the exis-
tence of those countries up for
debate.

Although the Jewish people
are directly connected to each
other through culture, tradition,
and discouragement of inter-
marriage, the effects of 2000
years of Diaspora have also made
us as much strangers as relatives.
I, as a United States-born,
secular Jew, may possibly feel
more in common with a U.S.
born Christian than with a Jew
from Argentina. And from the
surface, a Moroccan-born Jew
may appear to have more in
common with a Moroccan Arab
than with me. In coming to
Israel I have had the opportunity
to spend time with my Hasidic
relatives of Russian background,
Sephardic relatives from Tunisia,
and Eastern European relatives
from Hungary. In these encoun-
ters I have felt the connection
and similarities of our shared
Jewish traditions, along with the
distantness of our philosophies
and lifestyles.

The one bond we share as
Jews and have never escaped in
all of history is that of anti-semi-
tism. It has unfailingly cut across
all racial, class, national and
generational barriers. This is a
very powerful and moving reali-
zation in my life and in the lives
of Jews worldwide. It's a sad
link to share, a depressing
statement on the evolution and
development of mankind. It’s
very ironic to me, that I feel this
deep-rooted and reoccurring
hatred of Jews to be the most
urgent reason for my identifica-
tion as a secular Jew and the
need for a Jewish state.

Being in Israel has been a
confrontation of my ‘Jewish’
realism and my ‘Jewish’ ideal-
ism. My realism sees Israel as a
necessary focus for the survival
and protection of the Jewish
people. As Jews, we need to take
care of ourselves and our own
issues first, because if we don't
no one else will. My idealism
only hopes that within this
insane sickness of anti-Semitism,
that I and other Jews will learn
quickly to relate our oppression
with that of oppressed peoples
everywhere. If we can then use
our collective anger and con-
scientiousness to rise above the
patterns and perpetuation of
anti-Semitism, racism, classism,
sexism, ageism, looksism, and all
other of the death culture’s
causes, then there remains a
glimmer of hope for humanity.
