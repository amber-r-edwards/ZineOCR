Tale

(Continued from Page 2)

a previous hearing that his real
net personal income was in
excess of $96,000 a year.

The judge then recessed the
hearing to chambers where a
written order was issued by
Judge Keyser.

The order says that the
three checks made out by the
husband for the past six weeks
support of the wife were impounded
by the court and placed in the
hands of the court clerk to be
given as a retainer when the
woman hired a lawyer.

Judge Keyser also imposed a
penalty on the woman, to be
paid to the husband for the
expenses and legal costs to
appear in court with a lawyer,
without considering that it was
the husband who had disobeyed
the court order in the first place.
Judge Keyser ordered that the
penalty be paid to the husband
in the form of deducting half of

the next two months support
payment.
The husband has departed

for a vacation in sunny California
for the Yuletide holiday.
Judge Keyser, presumably, will
be enjoying the good cheer and
comforts of his home in heavenly
peace. The woman and child
are wondering how they will
survive the Vermont winter. The
winter slowly grinds on.

Lunar
Toots

Dear Commonwoman women,
Thanks so much for putting
so much into this issue! It's
excellent so far as I’ve read. I’m
really excited about the lunar
calendar and have been using it a
lot. I appreciate the work that
went into it and would like the
woman who made it to know
that I’m really enjoying it.
I have no bucks on me and

not much more stored away, but
when I get more I’ll send you
some.

Thanks,

Kayla Becker

lunar calendar in our February
issue.)

Apology

Commonwoman:

My comment in “Three
Carpenters” in the December
issue of Commonwoman complaining I was being paid $5 an
hour, what laborers are paid,
understandably sounded like a
put down, as if my time is so
much more valuable than theirs,
I apologize, it was not intended
to be.

I’d prefer to be working in a
society that values all labor
equally, but unfortunately I’m
not. My comment was in reference
to men carpenters with
skills equal to mine being paid
$8 an hour and men and some
women laborers on construction
sites being paid $5 or less. I’m
pissed men get away with paying
me less based on their standards
than they pay themselves.

Again, to all people who
labor, I’m sorry.

P.C.
Revisited

Dear Commonwoman,
I would like to respond to
two readers’ letters that
appeared in the most recent
issue.

Elfy Janesdaughter, I really
appreciated reading your letter
about fat oppression. As a thin
woman, I have been indoctrinated
with a “fat is a slob” attitude.
Through reading fat oppression
articles and letters like yours, I
have learned much. Being visually
impaired, I experience people’s
looksism that makes them
uncomfortable at my presence. I
can feel their pity/fear. I realized
through the articles that looksism
is manifested in many cruel ways.
My learning has helped me in my
support of friends.

The other letter I would like
to respond to really scares me.
Joy Nelson’s words could easily
come from the mouths of
Khomeini or the Moral Majority.
The letter was about her reactions
to the “P.C. ‘House Beautiful’”
article in a recent Commonwoman,
I quote: “I am afraid that even
joking in this vein allows yourselves
and others to view you with less
than total respect. [My emphasis.]
There are better ways to laugh.”

Let me start by saying that I
am in no way personally attacking
Joy. I don’t think that she is
really aware of an aspect of her
statement. This attitude about
an ideology being so holy and
exalted that you can’t poke a bit
of fun at it is DANGEROUS. It
is the attitude of the Patriarchy,
with all its hierarchies and death.

I see Political Correctness as the
opposite of what I hear out of
their mouths — total hypocrisy.
It reminds me of a lesbian
version of the Moonies — sans
Sun Myung Moon.
Here we are, lesbian/feminists,
talking about love, caring,
nurturing, etc. We even talk
about the right to control our
own minds and bodies. And
when women do this, WHAMO!
Out you go. Suddenly one is
confronted with the idea that
you are free to think and act as
you choose as long as it follows
the “correct” line. Well, this all
seems very Patriarchal to me.
When I was coming out,
most of my support came from
my straight friends. Not the
“supportive” Dyke Community.

Being active in social-change
groups, in all this time, never
have I felt such keen pain,
self-doubt, and alienation than
at the hands of these “loving”
women. I have been purged in
true fascist form.

I have since picked up the
broken pieces of my lesbian life
with the love and support of the
other P.C. victims. The P.C. dykes
would surely hate my friends.
We are doing something constructive
with our lives. We even have
differing opinions (P.C. Sin
No. 1) and ways to make life
better for ourselves, our loved
ones, and communities.

I am so happy to see other
victims of this nonsense speaking
out. I am happy to see the Third
World women speak out. I no
longer feel alone. I feel that the
P.C. issue is an integral part of the
issues of class and race. Political
Correctness is a WHITE,
MIDDLE-CLASS fantasy! I hope
to hear more on this issue.

our energies. We were not
utilizing the space to its fullest
and many of us began to feel it
as a financial burden.

It was because of these
types of feelings and pressures
that we began meeting weekly as
a group in January to discuss
and question our status, goals,
and options. These discussions
led to an agreement that CVWC
should move to a smaller, less
expensive space in the Barre-
Montpelier area. It seemed as
though we had been operating
under unrealistic expectations of
ourselves and the Women’s Center
for a while. The discussions
were good because they forced
us to be honest about our
limitations and our priorities.

So far, our plan for the
Women’s Center is that it
operate as a Feminist Bookstore/
Resource/ Referral/ Advocacy
Center for women. Our exact
schedule of hours is yet to be
formed, but we have plans to be
open at least two days a week
and two evenings. We welcome
any women musicians, poets,
etc., to initiate evenings of
entertainment, political, or cultural
events. The new space is a
lot smaller than our old one
(11’ x 14’) so we will no longer
have the luxury of holding our
meetings, dances, and other
events in our own personal
space, but we will be advertising
such events and their locations.
Some positive aspects of the new
space is that we will be renting
from a woman, the rent is
only $75 a month, and we will
be sharing the building with
Legal Aid. A drawback to the
space is that it is on the second
floor and we will still be inaccessible
to women who are unable
to climb stairs.

My personal feeling is that
this move is a good one for the
Women’s Center women. It has
pushed us into a lot of consciousness
and discussion about our purpose,
our goals, our commitments to the
community and to each other, our
differences and limitations, and the

HEY! DID YOU HEAR THAT

ways we relate and avoid relating
with each other. Our meetings
are taking a more personal tone;
we are becoming aware of the
ways in which we can and
cannot trust and support each
other. It seems like we are
dealing with very real issues, and
being honest with each other.
We are moving in more ways
than one. I feel really good
about our changes.

We welcome all women who
want to join us in this process.
