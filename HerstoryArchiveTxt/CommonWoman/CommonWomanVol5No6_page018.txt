otherwise neutralize the Black
and socialist (ed. note) move-
ment. The framing of BPP
leaders Huey P. Newton, Ericka
Huggins, Bobby Seale, the assas-
sinations of Chicago BPP leaders
Fred Hampton and Mark Clark,
the forced exile of activists such
as RAM leader Herman Fergu-
son, the arrest and attempted
frame-up of the New York
Panther 21, and the attack on
and imprisonment of the RNA
11 in Jackson, Mississippi are
just a few examples... By the
many leaders and
members of those political
organizations under attack had
and continue to have their lives
disrupted by government-
initiated repression... Some
went on to become the nucleus
of the armed clandestine mili-
tary resistance of the Black
community, the Black Libera-
tion Army (BLA).

“Then as now, the govern-
ment responded by orchestrating
a big lie about a terrorist
threat... The projection of the
BLA as a band of wanton
criminal cop killers was central
to this... Then as now, most
people in this country bought
the lie, enabling the FBI and the
local police forces to embark
upon a shoot-to-kill strategy
with little opposition. (Many)
were murdered by the police on

the streets during this time,
others (including Dhoruba
Moore and the New York Three
— Herman Bell, Anthony Bot-
tom and Albert Washington)
were framed and convicted...
All, with the exception of Assata
Shakur (who escaped) remain in

prison today. They must be seen
as prisoners in a continuing war
begun in Africa against colonial-
ism...

“Ten years later, the
repression continues, and the
people of this country were
convinced that Fulani Sunni-
Ali (Cynthia Boston) was a
terrorist conspirator, involved in

a threat to the democratic
process of America, in the
Nyack robbery. And only

because of the way she was
arrested and the RNA connec-
tion. The government was able
to create a powerful image of
danger through its use of air
force and army personnel, tanks
and combat helicopters... She
walked free from jail five days

later when the government was
forced to acknowledge that she
had been a thousand miles away
on the day of the robbery...
Fulani’s real crime in the eyes of
the government is that she has
rejected capitalism because of
what it has done to her people...
Nyack was but an excuse to go
after Fulani and the RNA...
COINTELPRO lives on and no
democratic or revolutionary
response to the attacks on us by
the government will go
untouched by it... No one and
no nation is safe from the U.S.
government in its frenzy to
wipe out serious opposition to
its policies and programs... As
conditions in this country wor-
sen, and more and more militant
forms of fightback against
oppression develop, it will be
easier to fit Nyack into a revolu-
tionary political framework. It
will be easier to see Sam Brown,
Kathy Boudin, Judy Clark and

Dave Gilbert; arrested in direct

connection to the robbery, and
Sekou Odinga and Eve Rosahn,
arrested in the repression result-
ing in Nyack, as political prison-
ers in that same historic war
against repression...”
