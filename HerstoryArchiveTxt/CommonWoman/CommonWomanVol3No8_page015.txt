Justa Housewyffe  

’Tis said that writers take a walk  
To get their exercise.  
For hours of typing in their chairs  
Strains fingers, bottoms, eyes.  
But me, I’m Justa Housewyffe,  
Too oft bored into my shoes.  
(No wonder we may overeat.  
Or turn to pills or booze.)  
So, Justa Housewyffe may spend time  
To bang at her machine  
But gets her exercise as well  
By having House to clean.  
She sweeps and vacuums, even sings  
To blast the blues away.  
Do tell, Sister, have you too  
Been Housewyffing today?  
—Jena, Varre
