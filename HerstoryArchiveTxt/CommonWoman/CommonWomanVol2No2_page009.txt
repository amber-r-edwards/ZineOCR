mother who must forego work
possibilities and restrict herself
to the home. As a third of
Winooski's families are single-
parent, many people with
school-aged children are limited
in what types of work they can

for their children to be fed. The
one daycare center in the town
cannot take children at lunch
time, and it is difficult to find a
neighbor or friend to do it on a
steady basis.

Phil Fermonti, the Alli-
ance’s only paid staff member,
said of the school board and
administrators, “They seem to
have this picture of Mom in her
Campbell's soup apron, waiting

around in the kitchen for the
kids to come home. Like she has

nothing better to do. I know one
woman with a seven-year-old
daughter, who has the options of
working and having her child
come home to fix her own
lunch, or staying home and
getting welfare. She doesn't
want welfare, but she has no
choice.” Fermonti said that
there are many others in a
similar situation.

A new survey is being
conducted to find out how
many children would take part
in a bag lunch program, and if
residents think it would have a
positive effect on their families.
The proposed lunch program
would cost $1.25 per week, to
cover the cost of supervision.
Supervision duties are not now a

part of the teachers’ contracts.
The alliance favors hiring com-
munity people for the jobs. Mr.
Messier said he would prefer to
have “professionals” look after
the children.

“We can’t handle the insur-
ance costs of community wor-
kers,” Mr. Messier said. “We
want what's best for the kids,
but I don’t want to see the
school become a babysitting
agency. The problem is with a
lot of parents who don’t want to
pay their dues.”

Dorothy Fuller is one par-
ent who is quite willing to
assume part of the responsibility
for getting a lunch program
started. The mother of seven
children, she is active with the

Alliance’s Lunch Committee. “If
there was a bag lunch program, I
think a lot of parents could go
to work. There’s going to be
more jobs now in Winooski — a
soap factory's opening up,
there’s the new carpet factory,
and Facette's is going to open an
outlet here. Everybody I've
talked to says it would be a good
thing... My kids hate walking
home for lunch. It's at least a
mile each way. Sometimes they
just go to the store and buy junk
food. I don’t think it’s very
nutritious either, for kids to
have to hurry home and gulp
their food down. They don’t
digest properly... I just don’t see
how the school board can turn
down all these people.”

theatre. On Friday, marching
through Montpelier to Snelling’s
office, dressed as sportspeople
and with one woman swaddled
in bandages, we mocked Morse’s
statements that abuse of women
was merely “recreation.” We
proceeded to Snelling’s office
where we left a copy of a press
release reiterating our call for
the firing of Morse because his
statements were ‘symbolic of a
broader social attitude that
promotes violence, exploitation
and degradation of women.”

Although the Governor may
have hoped the issue, and us,
would disappear, neither did. On
Wednesday, 1/31, Peg, Deane,
Betty, Linda Wittenberg, Roz
Pfeiffer and Cheril Grenier met
with Morse, Bill Gilbert, and
representatives from the Govern-
or’s Commission on the Status
of Women. In a 2½ hour meet-
ing, we again called for Morse’s
firing and discussed the need for
legislation to fund shelter
homes, safe homes, and educa-
tion and training for officials
and the general public on the
issue of violence against women.
We pointed out that the State
has the financial ability with the
7 million dollar surplus to
finance this legislation. The
often heated meeting produced
no results on the firing, and left
many of us with the feeling that
little would be done by the State
because of a lack of commit-
ment to the needs of women.

On Friday, 2/2, Peggy
Deane and Ann Sarcka, execu-
tive director of the Governor’s
Commission on the Status of
Women, met with Mike Naurath

to discuss introducing legislation
outlined above. A proposal was
submitted for legislation for
statewide funding. Later, we met
with GCSW members to discuss
how we could work together,
and to find out what their
commitment to battered women
is.

While our efforts to oust
Morse have not been successful,
we have made the issue of
violence against women a public
issue. Women’s past work, as
well as our commitment to focus
on the needs of battered women,
will continue to ensure that
officials of the State assume
their responsibility to offer
protection and money to battered
women. Although the
Governor's office attempted, by
pitting women’s groups against
each other, to divert our ener-
gies, we stressed that we would
not buy into this patriarchal
attitude and technique of getting
women to fight each other
rather than the oppressor. The
united strength and willingness
of the women to work together
and continually refocus on the
issue proved our determination.
The effort of the women has no
doubt been a surprise to the
State, and one which we will use
whenever needed to further our
goals.

Once again, the time has
come for us to begin to be
visible, to put our bodies on the
line and to demand action. We
will not be ignored or go away —
we will remain to help our sisters
as long as this problem exists.
Together we will challenge and
change the attitudes that women
can be abused and that they will
remain silent and hidden. Any-
one interested in helping please
