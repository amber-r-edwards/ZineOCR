Sfull of accusations and rumors,
zpainful scene. She learned to
Strust more that it’s okay to not
Oalways “have it all together."
SFive daughters, by this time all
Sfeminists, all lesbians, too, en-
Scouraged and trusted her to love
Gherself. She allowed herself, with
much, much painful struggle, to
love her womyn friends too, in
particular to act on loving her
close friend, to be lovers with
her.

Yes, Cecilia Baldo. Straight,
as a self-focused strong womon
of color. From her also I learned
the painful art of acting tough
on the outside, keeping it
together for “everyone else.” (I
have since, with loving help from
my Colchester family, unlearned

much of this). Mother of six,
wife of a young lawyer, mom
always, and still does to a great
extent, put herself last... she had
one heavy case of “How to
Be a Good Mother.” I see now
that her life was hard, that dad
never validated the enormous
amount of work she did, that
she never had much space for
anything but the kids’ needs and
the husband’s demands.

After a while, and with the
culture as it is, she probably
thought it should be enough,
and forgot about wanting other
things. Until she started going
crazy with it; I remember, I was
in high school. I would come
home sometimes and find mom
huddled in a chair, crying hard.
Something “little,” like having
to make supper one more time,
had broken her. It scared me

then, I had believed her “super

mom” trip, and I didn’t know

about Adrienne Rich, about
nuclear family as patriarchal
womon's prison. Then I was
afraid and didn’t believe myself
when I told her, “It’s okay,
mom.”

Oldest daughter, outspoken
radical feminist before I knew
there were others; somewhere
inside mom celebrated my out-
rageousness, defended me when
they tried to expel me once —
told them I was a top student,
top athlete, well loved — she
told them they must be wrong
somewhere. Soon I had “poli-
tics,” and soon I visited home
and breathed feminist anger.
Validation for mom, threatening
to dad. Stronger and clearer I
watched her grow.

An incredible story, simpli-
fied to be sure. I could write a
book about mom, maybe I will.

Here though is a short sketch,
the first thoughts that come to
my mind. Not touched are the
years we fought, the expecta-
tions she had of me, my anger at
some of her classist (acquired)
ways, the way she needed me to
be a mother, very young, of my
four younger sisters. But as I sit
now in Michigan, on land where
only womyn are camped toge-
ther, working, I think with an
intense sense of love and respect
for this womon who I lived with
for 18 years, who I look a lot
like, who loves me intensely, and
who I am only now learning to
really talk with, enjoy, play
with.

My mom, 50-year-old Portu-
guese womon, womon-identi-
fied, lesbian, mother of five
strong self-loving lesbian daugh-
ters. I treasure her, celebrate her,
want to live again with her, by
choice and in friendship this
time, on land with womyn.

away from an event... because of
money. I bring these issues out
in hopes of encouraging talk in
the community about money,
class... Finally, I urge women to
support women’s culture accord-
ing to their means. I want
women to come to events if they
can't pay and not feel guilty.”

Music Midwives has started
dealing with class issues amongst
ourselves and in relation to the
Burlington community, which
we want to be a continuing
process.

Then the wimmin of Alive!
arrived in Burlington. “Having
them around town that week
was wonderful, I was scared they
might be in the way, that they
would take up more of my/our
(Music Midwives) energies — but
instead sharing and being with
them was energizing, easy to do.
Each of them carries her
Strengths with her and is really
open to sharing them. They fit
right into Burlington's spinning
web of womyn-energy.” “The
intense spiritual and emotional
high of the concert made every
ounce of the work worth it to
me.”

Then it was over. “For days
after the performance, I was
quite overwhelmed, sad, cried a

lot and felt a loss, a separation.”
“I felt the loss of intense day to
day connection with other Music
Midwives and sharing four days
with Alive! wimmin.” “I realized
that it was over and I had to let
go. I had to deal with the rest of
my life, the part I had put on
hold for three weeks. It helped
incredibly to find out that other
wimmin (and not just Music
Midwives wimmin) felt similar to
me. The energy in the Unitarian
church on November 8, 1979,
was so high I think we could
have done a ‘Take back the
night’ march all night, or moved
a mountain, or changed the
world.”

As for Music Midwives, the
success of “our first production
level has given us the
desire to continue.

Already we have received
two donations, one from a
womyn in Montreal, to be used
for our next production. We
want to bring music to Burling-
ton which speaks of wimmin’s
desires, spirit and growth. We
have been inspired and so have
many others, and we are going
to keep moving ahead to cele-
brate our womyn-selves, sharing
the pain and the joy. Sharing,
sharing.
