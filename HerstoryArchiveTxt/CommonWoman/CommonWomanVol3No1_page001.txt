The Sexual Revolution  

Until now, women have  
struggled for freedom as the men. Only in the  
so-called sexual revolution, and  
probably characterized it, was  
sheltered from criticism by the  
the recognition of the objectifi-  
cation of our bodies as a central  
contention for feminists, did  
women begin to question. Scat-  
tered action against pornography  
took place in the early seventies.  

They must turn over the profits of their  
past production of pornography  
to begin to undo some of the  
damage they and their ilk have  
done to women... Of course, we

Candles, flowers, announce-  
ments, women’s products and  
the arts have come to indicate  
a woman’s environment. 1979 has  
been a wonderfully rich year for  
women’s culture in Burlington.  
Among our sharings have been: a  
one-woman theater piece, Foot-  
hold, by Jane Day; Witch 1,  
A Band of Women; Holly Near,  
J.T. Thomas and Wendy Dragon-  
Fire at the Flynn; Flo Kennedy,  
Margie Adam, Rita Mae Brown,  
and Angela Davis on the UVM  
campus; the Roche Sisters at  
Hunt’s; Three Clowns from  
Boston; Kate O'Halloran at the  
UVM Jazz Series; Alive! at  
the Unitarian Church; Kay Gard-  
ner at the Warehouse; Kate  
Wolff from Putney; talent shows  
at St. Paul’s and the Winooski  
Mill; Hillary and Vaughn at the  
Black Rose; a summer of Sunset  
Coffeehouses — did you catch  
Donna Fialkoff’s mime? Whew!!  

On December 2 Joyce Shail-  
or produced Alix Dobkin in  
concert at Warehouse Hall and  
financially did slightly better  

than break even. Given our  
impoverished herstory in the  
male-dominated power struc-  
ture, the fact that this concert  
paid women, provided work  
exchanges and didn’t need  
volunteer labor is significant and  
encouraging for our female  
future!  

Alix Dobkin has been a very  
important person in my own  
life. The “Lavender Jane Loves  
Women” album was among my  
first experiences with women’s  
music. Hearing that word  
lesbian in positive, affirming  
statements repeatedly did have  
an amazing effect on my  
lifestyle. How could this woman  
say such strong stuff against men  
and so assuredly? I was appalled  
— and in my heart, I agreed with  
every word.  

Alix now looks softer than  
in 1974 — her hair curled; her  
shirt shined, I wondered if her  
man-hating would have toned  
down too. At the concert I  
heard her say she loves her  
father; that she is able to toler-

Male Sexuality and Violence  
In the early seventies, no  
doubt influenced by the women’s  
movement, sociologists  
began to question what Eliza-  
beth Fisher calls ‘the confusion  
of male sexuality and aggres-  
sion.’ The raising of the issue

and have polite conversations  
with a few men she knows. And  
in a calm, clearer than ever way  
I heard her righteous anger  
saying it’s not “human beings”  
who have devastated our planet  
— it’s men; not “human beings”  
who rape and brandish nuclear  
radioactive doom — it’s men.  
Alright Alix! Goddess — it felt  
good to me to hear her in her  
own inimitable style rap out the  
thoughts and feelings about men  
so many of us (gay and straight,  
young and old, black, red,  
yellow and white) carry inside  
and share with so few.  

Musically, Alix is  
better. Her voice and guitar have  
always been excellent. Her  
songs: the old, still fresh and  
strong; the new, real and power-  
ful. She shares with her audience  
deep parts of herself through her  
lyrics and presentation — parts  
that dykes especially can relate  
and empathize with. I appre-  
ciate, admire and congratulate  
her political/personal work.
