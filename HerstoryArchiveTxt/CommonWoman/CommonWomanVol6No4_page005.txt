& AAAS FUTURE

FUTURE. VISION:
Yours or the CIA’S

By Peggy Luhrs

Some of the most important
work we have to do is envision-
ing a female future, something
different than the one the boys
(military industrial establishment)
have planned for us. If
you don't know what the boys’
plan is, remember Watt and the
environment; we don’t have to
worry about it because Jesus is
coming. The Bible is a prediction
of Armageddon and as Mary
Daly points out the patriarchs
drew up this future and intend
to make it come true. The world
today is functioning in accor-
dance with patriarchal myths
drawn up thousands of years
ago. Until women assert and
actualize their own vision we are
stuck in their terms and those
terms are terminal. Primary
then, is having a vision. We must
understand that it is at the
mythic level that patriarchy is
most deeply embedded and has
its strongest grip on the world.
When we see that, we can see the
power of a new imagining.

Myth is a model for
behavior. I see it as a meta-
program for the mind, meaning
that at a deep and subconscious
level myth has programmed the
way we behave. What is suggested
to the subconscious
is received as the truth. Fed and
bred on patriarchal mythology,
we are still operating with
male myths that are designed to
deny and destroy the divinity of
the female and keep us from our
very selves. We must give our
selves room to surface and
replace our conditioning with
our own story.

“Unless we give ourselves
strong suggestions we end up
being controlled and molded by
the strongest suggestions made
to us — from society or specific
people.”
Peggy Allegro

In Sumeria, around 3,000
B.C., which is about the time of
patriarchal takeover, there is a
myth about a contest between a
goddess and a god. The change
from goddess to god-centered
culture took several millennia,
going from great goddess figures
to mother goddesses, to the
goddess and consort (often a son
or brother).

Finally there is a takeover
by the gods and a corresponding
increase of violence and decrease
of creativity, all culminating in
the vengeful, single deities of
Christianity, Islam, and Judaism.
In this particular myth the god
Enki challenges Ninmah, the
goddess, to a contest to see who
can make the more imperfect
beings. Ninmah does her worst
but all her creatures are fitted
into society. Enki goes to work
and makes a creature so dis-
torted and warped that life is
barely present. Ninmah is unable
to do anything for it and shrieks
with rage and despair. Thus the
goddess makes life but the god
excels at misery and death.

In the United States in
1945, atomic scientists assemble
at Los Alamos at a project called
Trinity to watch the first atomic
bomb explode. It is recorded
that these usually secular scien-
tists reacted with religious fervor
at the sight of the bomb going
off. In 1982, they have named a
nuclear submarine Corpus
Christi (body of Christ). God
excels at destruction. Destruction
is the religion of patriarchy.

In despair at the capacity of
the male for destruction, woman
lost sight of her own real power
and we have been ruled by gods
and war ever since. We are meant
to believe that the power of
destruction is the greatest power
there is. If we live in fear, we
will never know our own power.
Judy Grahn defines power as the
apple tree producing an apple. A
farmer owning an apple orchard
has only control; he does not
have the power to make an
apple. It is in fact men’s envy of
our birth function that has led
them to be masters of destruc-
tion in their need to compensate
themselves for lacking the power
of women. They have also done
their best to control birth with
negative results.

My vision for the future is a
world where both sexes and all
races live together in harmony
and where all of us are encour-
aged to develop our talents and
our individuality to the limit,
while respecting the individual-
ity of others. In this world, we
would all have equal dignity,
responsibility, and privilege, and
women, people of color, child-
ren, and the poor would not be
used as scapegoats and as cheap
labor by white males of the
upper and middle classes. In this
world, children would be loved
and nurtured by all, with no one
person so tied to childcare that
the job became drudgery. There
would be no child abuse, wife
beating, or rape, all of which are
crimes against individual human
dignity. Working in the women’s
movement to make this vision a
reality is my first priority in this
lifetime.

I have just been reading
about the CIA and its use of
psyche warfare. Part of its
strategy is to make the world
seem more threatening and vio-
lent than it is already. The idea
is to spread nausea and terror,
thereby paralyzing the popula-
tion and making them easily
manipulable. Psychology Today
did a survey and found that T.V.
watchers believe the world is
more threatening and violent
than those who do not watch
T.V. THE PROGRAM IS TO
PROGRAM. When a group is
afraid, they can be told what to
hang onto for security. And
guess who’s going to tell you
what to do? The CIA does not
want you to be in touch with
your own power nor does any
government because they are
about control. Destruction is not
real power; it is only negation.
But the patriarchal world is
enthralled with it. The man who
is talking about the dangers of
the CIA says political education
is important to overcome the
nausea that the CIA tries to
spread. If their tactics are
known, they are not useful to
them. Women can see all of
patriarchy as a program to keep
them powerless and afraid, look-
ing to some male god for a
non-existent protection in the
state of war that male supre-
macy is, and the state of rape
that it is.

Susan Griffin pointed out
years ago that “rape is,
among other things,
‘attacked keeps women attached
to a male for protection or limits
their freedom of movement. On
a collective level, when there is a
collective female uprising, war
can function as the same kind of
social control. All of this male
striding and saber rattling is to
impress women and themselves
with their power and keep
women from knowing our own
power.

In later Sumerian Myth, the
gods totally take over. Marduk
(the god) slays Tiamat (por-
trayed as a sea monster). He
takes the lower half of her body
(he has smashed her skull and
thrown her blood to the North
wind) and uses it for the Earth.
The warrior god creates the
universe from the body of the
conquered goddess. Here the:

Weaving the Future

By Michiyo Cornell

Women: we know the pain
of now, the sorrow of starving in
physical or spiritual being of
sisters and brothers. Our child-
ren must not endure such
lives. We must work for the
future now. Now is the weaving
time. Our hands weaving peace
and love. Our hands are not
without conflict but the unity,
the theme is our love for the
Earth and the wholeness of her
Being.

I have a vision of hands,
women’s hands weaving the
tapestry of our future. White
hands, yellow hands, brown
hands, red hands, and black
hands gathering the warp and
weft of our lives to make peace.
Women’s hands to make peace
where all colors are welcome:
white to black and in between.

Movement, sound, touch we
love ourselves and each other.
There is no more sacrifice of self
to others, of others to self.
There is no need for that. We
meet our needs in unity. Because
I have enough doesn’t mean you
have too little. There is enough
love and food and space for all
of us. Weaving, weaving this is
our weaving time. We will teach
all mothers’ children to love.

We will be
becoming who we can truly be.
Our vision will transform the
world and liberate the life force
patriarchs have tried so hard to
crush.

crazy. Livin dreams'll lead ya to
the end/s of yrself”

“We must envision the world
we want, make it so real in our
hearts that it already exists, like
the child growing towards birth
while we shape our songs of
encouragement.”

Elsa Gidlow

ing because it is absolutely
predicated on self-trust.”
