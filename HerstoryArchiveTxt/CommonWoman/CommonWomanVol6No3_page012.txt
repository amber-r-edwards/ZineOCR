Nell and Lynn are beginning  
to work on a book about Rose  
and her dying weeks at Glen  
Eyrie. The main part of the  
book will be the journal and  
photos from that time, along  
with an introduction, a part by  
Vicki, and a section about our  
process, confusions, and the  
things we learned about Rose’s  
physical care. We want to reach  
everyone who was involved to  
find out if you want your name  
used, or if you want to use a  
pseudonym, and whether we can  

use photos that you are in. We  
are also real open to your  
feelings, opinions and memory  

as to what you think the tone  
and focal message of the book  
should be.  

ANYONE — the women  
who were actually there as well  
as the women in town — who  
would like to write a few lines  
about how you felt then or feel  

Lesbian Herstory Archives  

Commonwoman just  
received the recent archives  
newsletter (which we send on to  
the EWP library) and we want to  
help spread the word. The  
Lesbian Herstory Archives exists  
to gather and preserve records of  
Lesbian lives and activities so  
that future generations of Les-  
bians will have ready access to  
materials relevant to their lives.  
The hope is that Lesbians will  

record their experiences in order  

to formulate our living herstory.  
The Archives will collect  
and preserve ANY materials that  

are relevant to the lives and  
experiences of Lesbians: books,  
magazines, journals, news-  
clippings (from any media),  
photos, bibliographies, herstori-  
cal information, tapes, films,  
diaries, oral herstories, poetry  

and prose (published and unpub-  
lished), biographies, autobiogra-  
phies, notices of events, posters,  
graphics, and other memorabilia.

RENOVATED BUILDING  

now looking back, please do so  
by August 1 and send it. We  
hope to compile an afterword  
in the book that includes all of  
these statements, and it’d help  
us project this and shape the  
project if we could get responses  
as soon as possible. If you can  
think of someone who may not  
see this notice (in Common-  
woman and in letters to the  
women who were at Glen Eyrie  
often), please copy it and pass it  
on.  

So far we have only met a  
few times. A woman writer in  
San Francisco, Sue Zemal, is  
helping too. We are writing  
(collectively) an introduction  
and an outline, and looking for a  
publisher. We are thinking in  
terms of a year or so timewise  
for this project. We don’t expect  
the book to make much money  
if any beyond our expenses, but  
if it does we are talking about  

and obscure references to our  
lives.  

In reading the newsletter I  
am moved by the dedication and  
vision of this work; it is a  
volunteer effort of love and  
pride that has been growing for  
over seven years now. I visited  
the Archives in New York (as all  
Lesbians are welcome to, just  
write or call ahead) and spent  
hours pouring over endless  
shelves, boxes, photo albums,  
diaries... like no library I've  
ever been in. Validation. Cele-  
bration. Lesbiana.  

Anyway, maybe you didn’t  
know about it (there are now  
other archives too, one in Flor-  
ida and one in Kentucky. See  
our last issue). The newsletter  
is full of notes asking/encour-  
aging you to send contribu-  
tions from your life, tucked  
in between amazing herstories  
and coming out stories from  
the twenties and thirties.

Beginning this project is  
sometimes bringing up lots of  
emotions. Old memories get  
stirred up. Many women who  
shared this time, both directly  
and indirectly, have moved away.  
The journal many of us wrote in  
is amazing. It was a special,  
incredible time.  

So please send your feelings  
and ideas; we'll try to keep in  
touch (maybe in this format)  
with whoever requests that  
about the progress of it all. And  
if you want to communicate  
with either of us specifically,  
please call or write. And take  
care,

Reminding that we create his-  
tory as much as we discover it,  
the women of the Archives ask  
that you send photos from any  
(all) phases of your life, old  
diaries and journals, and a note  
I especially liked: “Where have  
all the love letters gone? Don’t  
destroy letters, send them to  
the Archives!”  

The best thing about it is  

that it’s TRUE. All contribu-  

tions are lovingly welcomed —  
“famous” or not, you have a  
place in the Archives. We ALL  
create this Lesbian reality and  
the Archives want to include  
your life in its treasures. To  
arrange a visit, to get on the  

mailing list (everything they  
send in the mail is safely  
covered... the reality hurts), or

Getting Stronger: An  

Invitation By Sue Schein  

I would like to invite  
wimmin to attend an event I am  
producing on May 22nd in  
Plainfield (see ad and calendar  
entry), and to explain what I  
have been trying to do with this  
work, and what will be happen-  
ing on that evening.  

In the past few months, I  
have taken photographs of wim-  
min making themselves stronger,  
using weights, martial arts, wea-  
pons, tools, etc. These are the  
images the phallocentric media  
have kept from us, and these are  
the images I wanted to see.  
Especially I was looking for the  
wimmin who appear hardly ever  
in media: wimmin whose skins  
are dark, bodies are fat, who are  
noticeably physically challenged,  
are old, young, real butch.  

There are in the pictures I  
was able to make some fat  
wimmin, some black wimmin,  
some chicana wimmin. But not  
enough. Limited to who hap-  
pened to be using the facilities  
(in Boston) on the day I hap-  
pened to be shooting, I have really  
only a cross-section of the gym's  
(the dojo’s, the target range’s)  
clientele. And in order to render  
visible those of us who have  
previously been blanked out of  
pictures, I feel we have to make  
an urgent priority to see lots of  

pictures of lots of diverse body  
(and lifestyle) types. Therefore,  
I consider my show only a start,  
and will leave one wall blank so  
that those of you who attend  
can bring along a snap, drawing,  
image that will be able to be  
seen by others, that will explore  
this diversity.  

The show will consist of a  
display on the walls of photos  
and collages, perhaps a slide  
show, a forum for discussion,  
and a demonstration by many of  
the wimmin from the New  
England Women’s Gym, who are  
in the pictures, of competitive  
powerlifting and body-building  
techniques, working out for  
fitness and strength, and self-  
defense. Tentatively scheduled  
to appear are some wimmin  
from Quebec, trained in Wen-do  
—a martial arts form for wim-  
min. And a dance will happen  
which may be engineered by  
wimmin from Quebec who have  
a business as audio engineers,  
DJing dances and concerts.  

Many of the images have  
been xeroxed and will be sold as  
CHEAP ART to raise money  
for Aid to Incarcerated Mothers,  
an advocacy group for wimmin  
in prison and their children.  
There is no admission charge —  
my hope is that you will donate  
an equivalent amount to AIM or  
buy lots of CHEAP ART.  

Womana-ture Productions  

What does an aspiring poet,  
writer, artist, musician do to get  
her creative material out to the  
general public? Where would she  
go for help? The answers lie in  
the formation of a new produc-  
tion company called Womana-  
ture Productions.  

Founded by three women,  
artist/writers, of Vermont, who  
felt the isolation of creating in  
Vermont without channels or  

easy access to the public, this  
company is a clearinghouse for  
creative visions.  

The three women, Linda  
Suskin (Indigo), Donna Van  
Marter and Cynthia Isleib of  
Richmond, Vermont, left their  
previous professions as speech  
pathologist, teacher, carpenter  
to create this clearinghouse as  
support for their own artistic  
endeavors.
