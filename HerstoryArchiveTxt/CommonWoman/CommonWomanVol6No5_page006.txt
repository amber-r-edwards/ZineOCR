Local Songspinners

The oral tradition is many
many generations old: it is
singing and storytelling as a way
to share news, teach lessons, and
entertain ourselves. Singers and
storytellers used to be our
neighbors; now, they're way way
up there on stage, or in a record-
ing studio: fantasy stars. It is
important to remember that
each of us has songs inside of
ourselves to share.

If you create music (even if
no one else knows you do)
please share in a celebration of
local women’s music. First, we
plan to collect the songs and
print them in a booklet. Then,
there'll be a gathering, a com-
munity sing. At the sing, the
booklets will be available, and
we can all learn each other’s
songs. Women could bring tape
recorders to the sing, and make
'tape records,' to learn the
songs better, and to just enjoy at
home.

Songsharing is a source of
strength, validation, and fun for
all of us woman-survivors. If you
have some songs that will feed us
and amuse us, and that feel good
for group singing (being simple
enough for others to learn)
please send them. In addition,
send your favorites!

If you can write out musical
notation, send written-out notes
and words, along with a tape. If
you don’t use written music,
send the words and a tape.
Include your name, address, and
phone. Send your songs in by
October 15, to Songspinners, 78
Monroe St., Burlington, Vt.,
05401. If you have questions or
want to help organize the
booklet or sing, call Joyce,
863-3586. Be Brave! We want to
hear!

Perhaps this was the first
social event, of my time anyway,
with no business allowed, but
the business of thanks. It was
the first annual herstorical din-
ner, on August 8th of Women
Helping Battered Women, to
celebrate the return of a shelter
to Burlington.

The first shelter came and
went, and served many women,
before it was finally defeated by
hard economic realities. The
second shelter, opening soon, in
the Year of the Battered
Woman, is being funded by a
$85,000 dollar HUD grant
through the city of Burlington.

We met at Glen Eyrie, on
the lake, to eat, drink, talk, sing
and celebrate each other for
eight years of continued hard
work. The event bolstered the
spirits of today’s women, and
commemorated those of the
past.

There are more thanks due,
to women who have moved on,
and women outside the collec-
tive who have helped through
the years. We'd like to offer our
special thanks to Sandy Baird
who gave us tremendous sup-
port, provided us with office
space, and has shared her legal
skills freely to help battered
women. Thanks to everyone,
and a reminder that the work’s
never done; volunteers come and
go, burn out is high and new
energy is always needed. Any
donations, of time, money,
furniture, dishes, use your ima-
gination, are welcome. Call us at
658-3131.
