THE OTHER AMERICA

Latin American
Conference

By Nancy Powell

The one-day conference on
Latin America at Trinity College
which was held on April 4 gave
participants some first-hand in-
formation on the intolerably
repressive conditions under
which native peoples are fight-
ing. A film, My Country, Occu-
pied, graphically illustrated how
U.S. corporations bleed these
countries, in this case Guate-
mala, dry, how people work for
40 cents a day for United Fruit,
are killed for attempting to
organize, but do so anyway. And
always, our responsibility as
Americans who profit by an
easy, comfortable standard of
living made possible only by
exploitation of the Third World
was brought home.

Those present, about 40 or
50 people, were privileged to
have two speakers: Ulises Torres,
a Methodist minister and former
political prisoner of the Pinochet
government of Chile, and Vic-
toria Ortiz, a New York-based
freelance writer who has travel-
ed/lived in Cuba and Mexico,
and who is also a member of
WIRE (Women’s International
Research Exchange, of New
York).

Torres first made the obser-
vation that the usual (male)
triumvirate of church, govern-
ment, and the military has one
partner temporarily absent in,
for example, El Salvador, where
some of the priests and nuns are
involved in the revolution. The
overall, nominal policy of the
Catholic Church for roughly the
past decade has been one of
trying to better the conditions
of the peasants, but at the same
time maintaining the Chris-
tian dogma of “the meek shall
inherit the earth” (when?) and
advising people that they are due
their reward only in heaven.
How could the church try to
alleviate the corporate-induced
poverty while it holds vast
investments in those same cor-
porations? It would be working
against its own interests.

Ortiz lived in Mexico for
five years, and saw women
organizing in the late 70's for
the first time. A country known
for its “progressive” foreign and
repressive domestic policies,
Mexico is a place where agitating
for human rights is met with
frequent brutality, though less
so than in, for example, El
Salvador, Guatemala, Chile,
Argentina, Brazil, etc. (A Mexi-
can filmmaker who's had
first-hand experience in South/
Central America says that the
torture practices of the often
U.S.-trained police in Argentina
and other countries are so brutal
and disgusting that he wouldn't
describe them. And this is a
region where dismembering, sex-
ual torture, mass murders, etc.,
are commonplace among the
right-wing military regimes.)

In Mexico, some unions,
which are a part of the govern-
ment, have worked with
women’s organizations, support-
ing them on abortion, rape,
etc. Abortion is of course illegal,
with one-to-seven year sen-
tences, but fairly few prosecu-
tions. Contraceptives are avail-
able over-the-counter, but they
are generally the ones proven
too dangerous for use by white
American women and shipped to
Mexico and the rest of the Third
World to be sold there. In a
country/world where male viril-
ity is measured by how many
children a man has sired (espec-
ially male children), gains in
reproductive freedom are hard
won.

Women have historically
been at the front of revolution-
ary struggles, and inevitably are
kicked back to the kitchen after
the new male regime takes over
— the sons merely replace the
fathers. Ortiz stressed the need
for autonomous women’s groups
which parallel the mixed or
male-dominated organizations.
Women in Nicaragua had a
separate organization which
worked with but was indepen-
dent of the revolutionary FSLN
(National Liberation Front).
Getting women involved in the
struggle was one reason for their
success, the left having made the
mistake of ignoring women.

Feminists are often accused
of not working on as significant
or revolutionary a level as the
left supposedly does. Ortiz
noted that it’s the women’s
movement which has been active
and made gains in the last
decade. She later clarified her
position on the issue of whether
feminism is “part of the larger
struggle” by agreeing that when
we act to gain control over our
bodies, lives, destinies, we are
challenging the social/economic
structure at its base — at the
level of the family and female/
male relations. We are trivialized
for working on the issues that
affect us and only us, and which
men either give lip service to or
are opposed to.

In much of the world,
people, women, are fighting for
the basic rights to food, land,
shelter, health, literacy. We have
an obligation to, as Ortiz said,
“protest loudly and forcefully”
about the “really drastic condi-
tions” which this country has
created in Latin America and
around the world. The United
States has a viselike grip on the
Third World, and it will take a
great movement of people
abroad and in this country to
stop the Reagan administration
and international business inter-
ests, including especially the Tri-
lateral Commission.

But all empires must fall,
and for the sake of thousands
upon thousands brutally dead
and dying in Latin America, we
will do what we can to bring
down this one.

March I have been experiencing
a serious boxed-in, freaked-out
feeling of being powerless. A lot
of this leads back to the political
climate of our country. Since
Ronald Reagan was elected
president, the shit has really hit
the fan.

The president of the United
States has historically been both
a puppet and a cover for big
business, and therefore, has
never really had ultimate power.
Now big business has Ronald
Reagan and his gun-toting bud-
dies and they are powerful, and
they have deeply shaken me and
everyone I am involved with.
They are cutting humane and
responsible programs which have
taken 250 years of people
struggling together to obtain.
We, the people, were getting
crumbs and soon we will get
much less.

The Congress is holding the
door open for these cuts to
happen. This creates a sense of
futility and absolute insecurity.
There are cuts in children’s
nutrition programs, food stamps,
day care, emergency fuel, subsi-
dies for dairy farmers, subsidies
for victims of black lung disease,
mental health, legal aid, educa-
tion, ecological research, etc.,

ments — political prisoners,
welfare rights, national libera-

might generate storm here and
there. But only a mighty union
of them all could beget the great
hurricane to topple the whole
edifice of injustice.”

Solidarity With
El Salvador

By Robin Lloyd

As I recall my grammar
school history lessons, two per-
sonalities disturbed the sluggish
history of Central America:
Cortez and the Marines. Between
the two of them, between 1519
and the 1920s, my history book
had little to report. It seemed
that Central America drifted in
some sort of ahistorical stupor —
with luxurious abundance alter-
nating with cruelty and destruc-
tion. The Marines, as I remem-
bered it, did not invade, they
“intervened” to restore some
kind of order. After they left in
the 30s — having restored order
— we heard little more about
those countries bordering the
American Lake, until, of recent
years, Cuba, Nicaragua, and now
El Salvador have let us know
that the order restored masks a
greater disorder; of a people
progressively alienated by inter-
national capital from their land,
their resources, and their own
labor.

It is interesting now, with
the world and myself in a
different place, to reread that
history, written by one of the
people it happened to. Eduardo
Galeano, brilliant Latin Ameri-
canist and author of
Open Veins of Latin America,
begins his book:

“The division of labor
among nations is that some
specialize in winning and others
in losing. Our part of the world,
known today as Latin America,
was precocious; it has specialized
in losing ever since those remote
times when Renaissance Euro-
peans ventured across the ocean
and buried their teeth in the
throats of the Indian civiliza-
tion.”

And later:

“The reality is that under-
development in Latin America is
a consequence of development
elsewhere, that we Latin Ameri-
cans are poor because the
ground we tread is rich, and that
places privileged by nature have
been cursed by history.”

One of those places cursed
by history is El Salvador. We've
all read the statistics on El
Salvador by now. Densely popu-
lated, most of its rich land is
held by some 14 families. Their
history includes a strike and
massacre in 1932 where 30,000
people — mostly Indians — were
killed; lined up in the village
squares and shot down. What
they are experiencing now,
writes T. D. Allman in March’s
issue of Harpers, is Massacre II.
Nothing new.

But two new factors have
entered the picture: the deter-
mination by a superpower — us
— to make the Salvadorean’s
desperate struggle for human-
hood part of the Communist
conspiracy for world domina-
tion; and international publicity.

Luckily, the one counters
the other — at times, although
you'd never know it
reading our local press, who give
banner headlines to Haig’s sensa-
tionalist charges that the Soviets
have a Central American “hit
list," and bury eyewitness
reports from nuns and El Salva-
doreans on page 4 of Local.

Despite major network and
press acquiescence to the admin-
istration’s party line, the true
message has gotten through.
Americans have developed more
finely-tuned shit detectors since
Vietnam. The Administration
has been inundated with mail
running 12-to-1 against interven-
tion. Even the Burlington Free
Press has editorialized against
military aid.

In Burlington, the situation
in El Salvador has caused a
coming together of concerned
church people — mostly Roman
Catholic — and the secular
progressive community. As part
of a nationwide protest to
American policy, an ecumenical
service in memory of Arch-
bishop Oscar Romero, murdered
a year ago this March 24, was
created and read by clergymen
and nuns and laypeople from a
number of Burlington area chur-
ches. It was a moving experience
— since it happens so rarely — to
hear church people speak out
on a moral issue. It was also a difficult experience
for some who had come to hear
the videotape and found the
service too long and too Chris-
tian. People taking part in the
service were offended by women
laughing and talking in the
lobby. There was dismay among
both parties.

This experience made me
feel that as the movement grows
— as it's bound to do in the
months to come — we're going
to be joining forces with people
from vastly different worlds, and
if we can’t rejoice in — or at
least respect — that difference
we're going to be in trouble. For
my own part, I’ve found the
outreach to Catholics that has
happened in work over El
Salvador has been the most
rewarding part of the struggle.
I've learned a lot. There is an
incredibly powerful movement
within the church that has made
a “preferential option for the
poor” the focus of all its work,
and which sees the repression
caused by international capital-
ism as “institutionalized sin.”
Quaint wording. But they're
dead serious, and some of them
are dead as a result.

The Burlington CISPES
chapter (Committee in Support
of the People of El Salvador)
includes nuns, radicals, and
students. CISPES is not neutral.
It takes the side of the people,
and sees the Democratic Revolu-
tionary Front (the union of
guerrilla forces) as the expres-
sion of the Salvadorean people.

Official ravings on El Salva-
dor have diminished in the last
few months — although arms
shipments are pouring in at a
