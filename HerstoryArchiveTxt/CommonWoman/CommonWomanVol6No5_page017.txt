At last — a book in celebra-  
tion, respect, and support of  
Lesbians who are mothers, and  
Lesbians who want to be. The  
editors interviewed many Les-  
bians and their children, all of  
them in England, as they pulled  

Boston  

together stories of Lesbians  
raising children alone, with  
lovers, in group households,  

with friends, and with ex-hus-  
bands. The children speak about  
feelings for their mothers, and  
her Lesbianism, and about how  
they relate to their mother’s  
lover (there is no word in the  
English language for this  
relationship). The National Gay  
Task Force (in the U.S.) esti-  
mates that between 1,430,000-  
2,220,000 Lesbians are mothers.

One of my favorite parts of  
the book is the introduction. In  
what I found to be a fascinating  
piece of writing, the authors  
drew me through a careful and  
creative explanation of how  
romantic love, (hetero)sexuality,  
and motherhood came to be so  
intertwined and that, therein,  
lies the societal condemnation of  
Lesbian motherhood. The fact  
is, sex and love can be very  
separate and, especially for Les-  
bians, sex and motherhood have  
no interdependence at all. For  
women (but not men) sexual

Newsletter of Les-

Commonwoman has  
received the Summer ‘82 issue of  
the Grapevine from Canada. It  
includes reports on specific cases  
of women in Toronto and St.  
John who are fighting for  
custody, and updates from chap-  
ters in Calgary, Alberta and  
Vancouver, B.C. There is also a  
U.S. custody news summary and  
poetry, book, and movie  
reviews. The Grapevine is  
published twice a year and 3000  
copies are distributed. To sub-

unemployed, $20 if you have it)

E, Toronto, M6H 4E1, Ontario,  
Canada.

In reading this 8-page paper  
I am brought close to the  
frightening, infuriating and dis-  
gusting reality that Lesbian  
mothers are still losing their  
children daily through custody  
battles scored with homophobia.  
These women need us (especially  
Lesbian non-mothers) to lend  
our support whether through  
protest letters, support letters,  
or financial help toward legal  
costs.

Sometimes it amazes me  
how insular I can be, and this  
newsletter is a good connector  
to the struggles, and the growing  
number of victories of Lesbians  
defending their right to mother  
their children.

REVIEWS  

pleasure is one thing, and the  
reproduction of the species a  
separate other. The eggs leave  
the ovaries regardless of whether  
the woman is sexually stimu-  
lated. A man has the ability to  
impregnate every time he is  
sexually involved. A Lesbian  
therefore has much more free-  
dom to choose motherhood —  

totally separate from sexual  
activity — than heterosexual  
women.

Some of the women came  
out after marriage and children,  
others chose to have children  
after coming out. Issues about  
paternity (should the child know  
who the father is, how does joint  
custody work best, custody  
rights, etc.) are discussed, and  
some pretty in-depth testimonies  
included by women choosing  
different ways to get pregnant.

There is a lot of information  
in the book about artificial  
insemination. The authors, and  
some of the women interviewed,  
are interested in dispelling the  
myth that it is a complex  
process, one in need of the  
medical world’s “help.” With  
clear and simple instructions, the  
reader learns how to get and  
“inject” the sperm, what to test  
for (in the sperm, blood, and  
general health of the donor),  
what to be careful of (sperm  
should be transported in a clean  
container in a brown bag), and  
when to inseminate. The authors  
also deal with the political  

Reweaving the  
Web of Life: —  

A new book edited by Pam  
McAllister is soon to appear.  
Reweaving the Web of Life:  
Feminism and Nonviolence.

Reweaving, spinning, mend-  
ing. These images occur over and  
over in the work of the women  
engaged in this anthology.

This book is structured in  
two parts. The first part deals  
primarily with theory. The wri-  
ters explore various ideas about  
the revolutionary implications of  
combining feminism and non-  
violence and address such issues  
as masculinity and war, women’s  
commitment to peace, patriar-  
chal power and feminist resis-  
tance, sexism in the peace  
movement and feminist distrust  
of traditional nonviolence  
theory. In the second part of the  
book, the writers generally show  
how feminism and nonviolence  
apply to specific areas of strug-  
gle: tax resistance, anti-war and  
anti-nuke work, self-defense,  
animal rights, personal relation-  
ships.

implications of artificial  
insemination, quoting: “I think  
AI is giving Lesbians who want  
to become mothers a real chance  
to be independent of men  
making claims on children.”  
Regarding the legality, there is  
no Federal law in the U.S.  
restricting who can perform AI,  
and though individual states  
have laws, self-help groups of  
women are using AI all over  
America. In an especially good  
chapter, “Where There’s a Will,  
There’s a Way,” clear and simple  
information and guidelines  
regarding the selection of donors  
and semen (with specific tests  
recommended), and some reali-  
ties about fertility are listed by  
the authors. They also discuss  
sex predetermination, and give a  
couple of sources for more  
information. (One additional  
source they neglected to men-  
tion is the last chapter of a  
paperback, The Violent Sex.)  
Now, the authors are aware  
of what all this means; women  
can have children and create  
families other than the nuclear  
family. They validate that this is  
revolutionary, that, in fact, the  
nuclear family as we know it is  
in a sharp decline. In addition to  
posing arguments against the  
institution of marriage, they  

- propose that “instead of spend-  
ing millions on what has gone  
wrong with the nuclear family,  
and how to rehabilitate it, we  
ought to spend those millions on

finding out what domestic con-  
ditions will suit the people of  
the future better, and how to  
achieve them. There ought to  
be nothing really terrifying  

about people of the same sex  

sleeping together, about AI,  
about economic independence,  
or about households based on  
friendship.” (p. 145) They cele-  
brate the improvements that  
many of the Lesbian mothering  
situations they encountered  
make on the  
family. “By looking at the  
alternative models provided by  
Lesbians, it is easier to see some  
of the inadequacies and aberra-  

tions typical of the nuclear  
family.”

Heterosexual society  
assumes that all mothers are  
heterosexual women; so, it  
seems, do many Lesbians. To me  
this fact has meant that Lesbian  
mothers are often isolated, often  
without the support and child-  
care help that heterosexual  
women have more “built-in” to  
their lives (families, friends with  
kids, etc.). The book fell short  
for me at this point — I needed  
the women to talk about being  

mothers in the Lesbian  
community more, or  

aren’t. Support issues about  
childcare at events, other women  
helping financially (since the  
“state” falls short) for daycare,  
camp, and schools, relationship  
issues with mothers and friends  
who aren’t mothers... these are  
things I need to hear talked  
about; that need was unmet by  
this book. I know it is hard to be  

“traditional” —

a dyke mom — to be a mom,  
period. None of the women  
talked about that. It was a little  
too “rosy” for me and could, I  
imagine, be a difficult compari-  
son for many mothers who need  
a reality check about how the  
hard times come with the good  
in mothering.

“Courts of Flaw” is a  
chapter detailing the enormous  
power of “the system” in  
causing havoc to Lesbian fami-  
lies. The idea that lesbianism per  
se has been accepted as grounds  
for deciding that a woman is an  
unfit mother is the distressing  
reality. The irony in this is that  
it is so much easier for a Lesbian  
than for a heterosexual woman  
who doesn’t want children to  
avoid having any. There are  
certainly Lesbians who don’t  
like children just as there are  
heterosexual women, and men,  
who don’t. And then there are  
Lesbians who choose to have  
children, and women who come  
out later and love and want their  
children. “To say that a mother  
will not like her own child  
simply because she is a Lesbian  
is a serious charge which people  
in authority must be  
out very  
convincing objective evidence to  
support it. There is, to date, no  
such evidence.”

I could go on, but why  
don’t you read it. I bet you'll  
learn something, and I found the  
language down to earth and the  
reading easy. Bookstacks can  
order it, and the EWP Library  
has the Commonwoman review  
copy.
