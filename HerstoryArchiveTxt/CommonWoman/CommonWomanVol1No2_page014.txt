Winemaking is one of the  
“lost” women’s arts -- like bread  
making -- that has been proudly  
reclaimed by women in the last  
several decades. For thousands  
of years, women grew herbs for  
medicine, cultivated fruits and  
vegetables and grains, baked  
bread, brewed beer and wine,  
and spun and weaved cotton and  
wool for clothing. Making wine  
at home is a simple, easy way to  
get in touch with our  
foremothers' skills, start a  
fascinating hobby, and have a  
never-ending supply of delicious  
and healthful wine to offer to  
family and friends. Enjoy!
