Imagine a moonlit night and a  
gentle cruise on the water...  
imagine three hours of fun and  
conversation in the company of  
old and new friends... imagine a  
meal of vegetarian  
perfection... imagine the  
musical pleasure of a brand-new,  
high-energy, super-sounding  
band... imagine 240 women  
celebrating together... and you  
have the picture of  
WATERWOMEN!  

The idea for the event, held  
on August 6 aboard the ferry  
Champlain, was conceived by  
Louise Piche in the aftermath of  
the spring WOMEN WOMEN  
WOMEN Conference. That affair  
had opened the door for the  
public expression of women’s  
energy but had failed to provide  
the final touch, that last piece of  
closure for a large gathering  
where women could celebrate  
their new birth in this  
community... WATERWOMEN  
became that celebration, and  
also attracted a whole new  
group. For example, twenty  
women came from Montreal and  
camped for the weekend while  
awaiting this special event (and  
they claim an active women’s  
community of almost 1000  
members just waiting to unite  
with the Vermont  

therefore almost inevitable that  
she should pay for her right to  
exist, to keep a position in  
whatever line, with sex favors.  

one man, in or out of marriage,  

Nowhere is woman treated  
according to the merit of her  
work, but rather as a sex. It is  

Thus it is merely a question of  
degree whether she sell herself to  

or to many men. Whether our  

contingency!). And women who  
balked at the idea of outside  
“stars” for WOMEN WOMEN  
WOMEN gave whole-hearted  
support to this local enterprise.  
And a few came for the first  
time to a women’s event and  
went home glowing with the  
excitement and energy.  

The boat had barely left the  
dock when the crowd began to  
partake of the delicacies laid out  
buffet-style... avocados stuffed  
with tomatoes, celery, walnuts,  
and sour cream; French rolls;  
cheese; and a fresh fruit dessert.  
There was plenty for everyone  
and enough extra so that those  
who came back for “just one  
more avocado” did not have to  
feel guilty. The menu was a  
gourmand’s delight on a budget  
that would be the envy of any  
house manager. And the food  
preparation was a community  
effort led by Ellen Temple and  

Nancy Edson, assisted by  
Louise, Berthann and Lou  
Muliere, Britt Mueller, and Judy  
Ariel.  

Without waiting for the  

so-called proper moment when  
the boat's engines would be cut  
as the ferry cruised into  
Shelburne Bay, WITCH | A Band  
of Women put their energy into  
a solid sound that entertained  
dancers and listeners and  
strollers alike. The musicians  
deserved the highest praise for  
the quality of their work and the  
pleasure of their virtually  
non-stop performance. When a  
break was necessary, Mare Early,  
the designer of the poster  

reformers admit it or not, the  
economic and social inferiority  
of woman is responsible for  
prostitution... It is conceded  
that woman is being reared as a  
sex commodity, and yet she is  
kept in absolute ignorance of the  
meaning and importance of  
sex... “The wife who married for  
money, compared with the  
prostitute,“ says Havelock Ellis,

publicizing WATERWOMEN,  
was ready on disco. Organa on  
guitar, keyboards, banjo, and  
vocals; Kathleen Hannon on  
keyboards, guitar, and vocals;  
Lisa Kinsey on electric bass;  
Meri Furnari on marimba,  
percussion, and vocals; and  
Norma Kwestel on drums; had  
previous engagements at The  
Mill and The Acropolis prior to  
WATERWOMEN. From the  
sound that night and the  
response of those who tried out  
the beat on the dance floor,  
WITCH | can look forward to a  
fully-booked season. After all,  
we women want to listen to  
women entertainers!  

The budget was met for this  
event, which in itself was an  
accomplishment. There was no  
extra money to donate to  
WOMEN WOMEN WOMEN or  
to a potential Women’s Place in  
downtown Burlington, but the  
extra energy will pay off in the  
future. Each women’s happening  
facilitates the next, and the  
growth is boundless.  

Kudos to Louise who put the  
entire package together and to  
those women who helped with  
the implementation, publicity,  
and ticket sales. And kudos to  
all 240 women who put out  
their time, money, and energy to  
come together and celebrate.  
WATERWOMEN will  
undoubtedly become an annual  
tradition... and, for those who  
did not make the first trip, buy  
your tickets well in advance next  
year. Remember, the boat only  
holds 300!  

“is the true scab. She is paid less,  
gives much more in return in  
labor and care, and is absolutely  
bound to her master. The  
prostitute never signs away the  
right over her own person, she  
retains her freedom and personal  
rights, nor is she always  
compelled to submit to man’s  
embrace.”  

(Emma Goldman (1869-1940)  
in “The Traffic in Women’’)

WITCH | at  
THE MILL  

By Linda Wittenberg  

Witch 1, that local Band of Women, has been making music at  
the Mill in Winooski. Community members, mostly women,  
{mostly lesbian women) have come to the performances with high  
energy in support and celebration of these women musicians, and  
in joy that there is now a local space where women can dance and  
socialize together in public without the usual harassment of bar  
owners and threatened men on the make.  

Witch 1 is not making music just for women, but it is making  
women’s music — i.e. music through which an energy flows that  
allows for people to dance in groups and circles, for people to  
dance alone or together, for people to smile and laugh. One night  
at the Mill, most of the people dancing joined hands in a snake  
dance — circled and wove around the floor, under and through  
each other's arms. This is a special communication, a special  
energy that creates community. Women’s music creates within us  
a very different energy than male rock or disco. Here are songs  
with words that aren't offensive; music with rhythm and sounds  
which don’t turn you and your friends into grunting, grinding  
objects for each other's sexual gratification.  

I wondered why those attending the Mill were mostly lesbian  
women, and why most men and straight women didn’t stay. I was  
told by one woman that straight women at the Mill felt  
“oppressed” by so many lesbian women dancing. This seemed to  
me to be a poor excuse for fear — that many heterosexual women  
felt afraid of being around lesbians, afraid of confronting and  
challenging their own self-images as straight, afraid of being  
wrongly identified as lesbian (guilt by association). These fears, if  
acknowledged, can be dealt with in a supportive way by lesbian  
women who have all felt those same fears. I have been in  
situations where lesbian women dancing together have seemed  
exclusive, have seemed sexual, seductive, seducing (i.e. “normal”  
heterosexual dancing). This kind of dancing seems oppressive to  
me. This is not the type of dancing that has been happening at  
the Mill.  

I thought about men coming to hear Witch 1. I think it is hard  
for them to come with their women friends because there are so  
many strong, independent women around (i.e. un-dependent on  
men). I think it is hard for men to feel that they are not the focus  
of attention of their date. I think it is hard for men to dance  
alone, or in a group, or with other men, without being someone's  
special partner. I think it is hard for men to dance to women’s  
music.  

I would like the Burlington women’s community, lesbian and  
straight, to think about these issues. Witch 1, just as women  
emerging in all job fields, needs the support of a large community  
to make their living as musicians. Let’s band together.  

From you to me, and vice versa:  
An Antitrust Suit  

I call to you and you come close  
Close enough to touch  

You leave your finger  

prints on my heart  

I get out my John’s son pledge to polish them away  
Some won’t go —  

Even the softest touch  
(Especially) the softest touch  
Leaves behind lines of acid  
That etch through the finish  
And into the veneer  

Sanding would get them out  
But there would be scars  

If I tell you that  
I love you  
Don’t take it personally.  

I have made a commitment to myself  
I am sorry for my coldness  

But Sorrow Does Not Change the Thing  
It’s only sorrow
