GETTING STRONGER

Dear Commonwoman,

Good news! $150 was con-
tributed (more when I return the
bottles) to AIM at the GET-
TING STRONGER event. Some
of the issues raised seem really
important and worth continuing, and as there
wasn't time, at the show I'll
summarize in brief the issues I’ve
heard about, and encourage us
to keep dealing with these and
related ideas.

1) The primary issue I’ve
heard is LOOKSISM. Do we
make our bodies stronger as we
would maintain a cherished and
unique tool, say, in order to use
them well, or do we cultivate
this and other features of our
appearance in order to impress
others? Do we allow ourselves to
evaluate and respond to wimmin
according to how they APPEAR
and not how they ACT and who
they ARE? Do we overlook or
deny the beauty of fat wimmin?
Wimmin whose use of their
bodies is limited or in some way
different than our own?

2) The relationship between
coach and athlete attracted
notice. Can or should this be a
polite, compassionate or egalitarian
relationship and still enable
wimmin to test and push against
their current limits?

3) Do we award “points” to
those of us who look or act
“macho” and devaluate or overlook
the wimmin with a “softer”
style? Have we inherited the
assumption of the dominant
culture that what is “tough” is
great yet what is “gentler” is
womanly and therefore bad?

I'd also like to publish the
names and addresses of the
wimmin who are employed
doing that for which they
contributed service, as I’ve had
several requests:

Jo Caron and Sylvie
Gauthier, 4249 Hotel de Ville,
Montreal, Quebec, Canada
(would prefer to do audio for
concerts rather than dances).

Beth Blackmore, 4840 St.
Urbain, Montreal, Quebec, Can-
ada (single day workshops in
self-defense, weekends, ongoing
groups. Also wants to meet
other fat wimmin for C-R).

Margarita Ascencio, N.E.W.
Gym, 46 Waltham St. No. 107,
South End, Boston, Mass.

Aid to Incarcerated
Mothers, c/o Urban Planning
Aid, 100 Arlington St., 2nd
floor, Boston, Mass 02146.

One last not-so-pleasant
thing: Jo Caron’s shirt was
taken. It is a blue and red
Hawaiian print, saying ‘Barba-
dos.’ If this has suddenly appeared
in your constellation, please
mail it to me and I will return it
to her.

Many thanks,

Sue Schein
