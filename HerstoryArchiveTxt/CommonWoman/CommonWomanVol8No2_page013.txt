Dear Women:

Did you know that there are
no uniform regulations or tests
to determine the safety and
effectiveness of tampons?

Tampon manufacturers are
using new materials in recent
years in their products. At the
same time, we are discovering
problems associated with them,
including vaginal sores and more
serious problems like Toxic
Shock Syndrome (TSS).

Tampon Standards

In 1981, the Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) requested
that the tampon manufacturers,
consumer groups (we are one of
six), and other interested parties
write a tampon standard. All of
us have been meeting every six
to eight weeks, but progress has
been slow. Consumers and
manufacturers are still at logger-
heads on crucial issues. This is a
brief report to alert women to
the issues we as consumer
representatives think are most
crucial. It also is a request for
your help.

We want some things the
tampon industry is unwilling to
agree to. The major areas are:

1) Absorbency may be a
central safety factor; lower
absorbency tampons are implicated
in fewer cases of TSS and
other problems. Although a test
for absorbency appears to have
been worked out, there is no
agreement on how to report
absorbency on tampon boxes.
At present, the term “regular,”
“super,” and “super plus” mean
something different for each
brand, and in some cases, one
brand’s regular is more absor-
bent than another’s super. These
terms must be standardized.
Because these categories are
broad, we want, in addition, a
more specific absorbency rating
within each category so women
can choose the lowest absor-
bency they need.

2) We want comprehensive
testing of the effects of tampons
and tampon ingredients on living
tissue (biocompatibility). The
tests proposed by industry do
not go far enough.

3) Tests to measure fiber that
comes off of the tampon are
necessary. We do not yet know
the range of problems that
pieces of tampons may cause
when they are left behind in the
vagina.

4) We need tests to discover
what living microorganisms (bac-
teria and spores) are present on
tampons purchased in stores.

During one of the women
medical profession, I’ll call Nan.
A woman hurt herself. Nan and
I helped her. I gave healing
energy with my hands. Nan,
then hesitating, told me she saw
auras. She saw a lot of intense
red at the place the woman said
was hurting. She saw my hands
giving green light that decreased
the flaming red. I now take my
skill as more real and Nan knows
now how to use her skill of
seeing anguish healing. We did
some healings together, reinfor-
cing and utilizing each other's
skills. Nan never talked about
seeing auras out of fear of being
weird or crazy and I never took
my healing skills seriously,
shrugging it off as an idio-
syncrasy. By talking and sharing
the unmentionable our skills
increased for the good of one
and all.

How many skills do we lock
away, hide and deny, misname
as crazy? Which words, which
keys can liberate these skills, the
ancient and future women
wisdom? At the risk of devaluing
all I've written so far, I’m gonna
tell you about another closet we
need to open. The one of
survivors of psychiatric oppres-
sion. Do I make sense to you up
til now? Often we perpetuate
the dynamics of blaming the
victim by silencing, getting
afraid of and backing away when
we discover a sister is an “ex-
mental patient,” a survivor of
psychiatric oppression. I am an
ex-mental patient, a survivor of
both incest and psychiatric
oppression. Does this change the
way you evaluate my article?
Going to a mental hospital
often is an effect of incest.

5) Manufacturers will reveal
only the main ingredients in
tampons and refuse to state
what they use for binders,
lubricants, perfumes, etc. We
want comprehensive ingredient
labeling.

6) Specific and precise cau-
tions about possible tampon-
related health problems in addi-
tion to Toxic Shock Syndrome
must be included on the package
label. Dismissing the evidence of
women’s experiences and
government reports, industry
wants the warnings to be as
vague as possible and relegated
primarily to the insert.

7) The package label should
state that the tampons are not
sterile.

8) This would be a volun-
tary non-government standard,
followed at the discretion of the
manufacturer. The only way we
know if the manufacturers are
following it is to require them to
state so on the label. If the
product says it meets the stan-
dard and doesn’t, the company
can be charged with misbrand-
ing.

9) The results of tests
required by the standard must
be available to independent
researchers and the public. Tam-
pon companies are not required
to and refuse to divulge any of
their test data, preventing us
from setting meaningful require-
ments in several areas.

Without strong public out-
cry now there will not be a
satisfactory tampon standard.

Please write to the FDA urging
support of the consumer posi-
tion. The FDA does respond to
letters. Pressure from women
consumers was an important
factor influencing the FDA to
classify tampons as medical
devices a few years ago. Make
your letter as brief or as detailed
as you wish. You could say
simply:

We are concerned about the
safety of tampons and want the
FDA to support the position of
consumer groups now working
on the development of voluntary
standards for tampons.

Please send us (the Boston
Women’s Health Book Collec-
tive) a copy of whatever you
send to the FDA.

“Reagan's policies are lead-
ing us to war. We want help in
terms of aid for schools and
hospitals, for education and
jobs. War between Honduras
and Nicaragua will solve nothing.
What is happening is not an
internally developed policy of
our president’s but externally
imposed by Reagan through
Ambassador Negroponte.”

These assertions were borne
out by what we, ourselves,
experienced, by what we obser-
ved, and by others we talked to
during our four-day stay in
Honduras.

On the way from the airport
to the hotel that morning our
van was stopped by police who
asked our driver for official
papers of some sort. We saw,
each day, people being arrested
on the streets. A man was killed
in front of our hotel one evening
while we were out for dinner. It
seemed as though police with
rifles, some with submachine
guns, were everywhere.

Our hotel faced the mili-
tary/police station across a
rather narrow street. Throughout
our stay little knots of
people, mostly women and
children, stood outside the sta-
tion, waiting and waiting. At one
point two members of our group
were taken into the police
station because they were seen
talking with one such family
who was waiting either for the
release of their son or for some
word about him. He had gone to
the station to get permission —
papers to go to Houston to
visit. But the police had

Reporting Problems
Another way you can help
make tampons safer in the
future is to report any problems
you have had with tampons to
the FDA.

These Device Experience
Network (DEN) reports have
been an invaluable aid to con-
sumer representatives in finding
evidence of problems such as
vaginal sores, allergic reactions,
irritation, unusual bleeding,
infections, fragmentation,
foreign material in tampons, and
injuries from inserters. All you
have to do is write a letter
including your name and address
(which is kept confidential), the
brand and type of tampon (if
you remember), and the prob-
lem(s) you experienced.

Advice Needed

Last but not least, we need
help from anyone who has
knowledge and information con-
cerning biological, chemical, or
mechanical tests relevant to
tampons or any of the issues
outlined above. We also need
advice from people with research
and statistics skills. Please con-
tact us at the Boston Women’s
Health Book Collective, Box
192, West Somerville, MA
02144.

Sincerely, Esther Rome, Jill
Wolhandler for the Collective.

Sierra, Public Information
Officer for the Honduran mili-
tary, who a few of us inter-
viewed in his office, seems
fixated on the notion that all
able-bodied men are trying to
get to Cuba to receive guerrilla
training. This is a standard reply
to inquiries about the missing.

Our meeting with these
brave women ended with our
offering to destroy our tapes,
our pictures, and, if need be, our
notes. Under the new Penal
Code, slated to go into effect in
January, it will be a crime
punishable by three to seven
years in prison for the members
of the “Comite” to speak to
groups like ours. Although they
acknowledged the danger in
publicizing their activities and
concerns, they asked us to get
the word out about their rela-
tives in whatever way we could,
“We must continue until we find
them. We must know whether
they are living or dead.”

was founded during WW II by an
English Quaker and a German Luth-
eran minister who pledged, as friends,
to work for peace though their
countries were at war.

Mary Wentworth is a long-time
community activist. She was a
founding member and the first Vice
President of the Massachusetts Ten-
ants Organization. In addition to
