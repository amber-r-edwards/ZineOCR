5 site) sex. At the same time they

O are only allowed to “love” the
other sex (the one who possesses

8 all the qualities that would
terrify the homophobe in him-
self).

In this sexual division of
labor womyn do the emotional
work and men the practical.
Each goes around as half a
person needing the other for
completion. I have seen womyn
come to lesbianism through
feminism because they began to
affirm themselves and their
female identities and to see their
wholeness. To see that they
could be strong, capable, aggres-
sive, that these are human traits
not male. In affirming them-
selves they came naturally to
affirming those who were like
them, other womyn. The homo-
phobes must be forever split
from loving their own sex while
outwardly admiring and inward-
ly despising the other sex.

Pleasure vs. Production

Flo Kennedy referred to our
enemy as breeders. Not all
heterosexuals fit this category,
but all breeders are heterosexual.
I refer here to the person who
sees sex solely in terms of
reproduction and the creation of
family units. Fetus worshippers
fall into this group. The idea of
associating sex with productivity
is a precondition for oppression.
If pleasure for its own sake is
taboo, if sex is regulated and
only for reproduction, then a

major source of joy and power is

taken from womyn/mankind.
Spontaneous self-direction is
replaced by other-direction.

Babies are born for the sake of
the race or the national econo-
my. One is no longer motivated
by what one feels but by moral
imperatives imposed by domin-
ant hierarchies, the church and
state.

We lesbians and gay men as
well as feminists threaten that
hegemony. We threaten the
existence of sex roles and the
sexual division of labor that
keeps many womyn unpaid
slaves. We threaten to reinstate
the pleasure principle or the
truly erotic as an organizing
force among people. We are a
threat to the existing order or
maybe the promise of pleasure.

Identifying Oppression

I ask my heterosexual rea-
ders to try and imagine a world
where you never see someone of
your own sexual persuasion
being publicly and — unself-
consciously affectionate. To
only see in the movies and on
TV, in magazines, books all
around you only the presence of
a sexuality not your own. A
sexuality that is supposedly the
only one, the right way, the
moral way, the natural way. To
not be reflected in your environ-
ment, to not get feedback from
the world at large. To be told
that the core of your being,
what is most real and precious
(your ability to love) is so
shameful that it must not be
spoken of and certainly not
seen. This is an extreme form of
oppression aimed at wiping out
one’s very being.

We hear from some blacks

that we are not oppressed
because we can pass as they
cannot. We hear from portions
of the left that we are only a
symptom of decadent capitalism
and will fade away as socialism
prevails. Among ourselves even
there is a tendency if we are
political to take on other causes
first and to see our own oppres-
sion as secondary. Some feel
sexual preference is not hardcore
politics. We come to other
causes because we naturally
identify with the underdog but
often do not make our own
cause primary. To stay honest,
politics must start with the self.

For lesbians the oppression
is twofold at least and more if
they are black, Asian or poor.
We are abused as much because
we are womyn as because we are
lesbian. We have to fight on both
these fronts. Quantifying oppres-
sion and dividing the under-
classes has always been a useful
tool for the rulers of the world.
Lesbians and gay men must take
their own oppression seriously.
The dominant culture takes us
very seriously or it would not
take such pains to keep us
hidden. Understand their fear is
our power. Talk about being gay
with straight friends, demand
more than lip service tolerance.
If you vote, make sure your
legislators know it’s an issue.
Understand if we don’t affirm
ourselves, who will? And come
out, come out wherever you are.

pornography is that ‘She likes it.
It is her fault because of the way
she dresses, the way she walks,
the way she sits. She was out
after dark. She invited a male
friend into her house. She said

“hello” to a neighbor. She
looked at a man. A man asked
her what time it was and she
told him. She sat down on her
father’s lap. She got married.
She’s not a virgin. She talks with
men. She went to a movie alone.
She took a walk alone. She went
shopping alone. She likes it. She
would have fought it off if she
really hated it.’

“What was it she wanted?
The force, the pain, the hurt, the
harm, the humiliation. Why?
Because she’s female. ‘Females
always want it, always provoke
it.” And how do we know?
Pornography says so. The law-
yers, the legislators, the doctors,
the artists, the theologians, the
philosophers, the writers, the
policemen have protected por-
nographers.

“There are some also who
say, ‘Porn is only fantasy.’ What
part is only fantasy? Women are
forced, raped, held prisoner.

These are real acts, committed
against real women and real
female children. The fantasy is
that women want to be abused.
We are here to shout, we do not

want it. Not today, not yester-
day, not tomorrow. We never
have and we never will. The
prostitute does not want to be
forced and hurt. The heterosexual
does not want to be forced

and hurt. The lesbian does not want
to be forced and hurt. The
young girl does not want to be
forced and hurt. This is a move-
ment against silence, against the
silence of the real victims. A
movement for speech, for the
speech of those who have
been silenced. We will never
again be silenced.”

it to proliferate to ridiculous
proportions. Many such may
begin quickly to speak of their
First Amendment rights, when
we are not saying they cannot
speak as they wish, just that if
they want our respect they had
better respect us and in a hurry!

When

The Equal Rights Amend-
ment has become implemented
thoroughly,

The word “homosexual” is

no longer harped upon because
all decent personal choice is seen
as natural,

School health classes teach
the reproductive system as
ordinarily as the cardiovascular,

Males have learned the con-
trasts between birth control
information, erotica, and their
ideas of what excites male
genitalia,

We will still be quite far

from having an ideal society.
