**Bandit**

From the Jerusalem Post

On February 14, 1981  
Poohlan Devi, a 24-year-old  
woman bandit, led her gang of  
dacoits (bandits) into the village  
of Behmai, India, and shot 20  
landlords. She marched the land-  
lords to a low mud wall and  
“shot them dead,” reports  
correspondent, Colin Smith.

Earlier that month Devi and  
her gang evaded police in a gun  
fight that left “5 of her men  
dead” and wounded four police.  
The report does not say how  
many people are in her gang.

According to Smith, Devi  
is a “round-faced young woman  
with a wheatish pock-marked  
complexion, about medium  
height, strongly built, and pos-  
sessing masculine hands and  
feet.” She carries a sten sub-  
machine gun stolen from police  
and wears jeans.

Devi's gang is a major tar-  
get of a crack-down on dacoits —  
Dacoits often direct their “ban-  
ditry” against landlords by kid-  
napping their sons. Local poor  
people admire the bandits and  
offer them support and shelter.

Indian police rarely catch  
dacoits alive.  
Smith implies that Devi  

leads an all-male gang. He also  
reports that she has had many  
husbands. She is named after  
the Hindu “goddess,” Devi, writes  
Smith.

*Merlin Stone writes in  
When God Was a Woman that  
“Devi means goddess in San-  
skrit. It’s taken from the  
Sanskrit root ‘Dev,’ meaning  
God.”

**Rape Charges Dropped**

Dallas — Sheryl Louise  
Brown, 19, was a talented  
athlete and sensitive woman,  
according to relatives and  
friends. Eighteen hours after she  
was raped, she killed herself.

Police arrested a man in the  
case, but said after Ms. Brown’s  
death late Saturday night by a  
gunshot wound to the head that  
they could not prosecute  
because she was the only wit-  
ness.

Walter DuVall, Ms. Brown's  
uncle, would not speculate  
about reasons for the suicide.  
Her high school coach, Kay  
Tidwell, said, “It’s hard for  
me to understand why she did  
it.”

**Self-Abort**

Chicago — A teenager who  
allegedly shot herself in the  
abdomen to terminate a six-  
month pregnancy has been  
indicted under a state abortion  
law and could face 14 years in  
prison if convicted.

Lorrie Gray, 18, of subur-  
ban Robbins, was indicted Fri-  
day by a Cook County grand  
jury on charges of violating a  
1975 Illinois law that prohibits  
abortions outside of hospitals  
after the first three months of  
pregnancy.

A female fetus died as a  
result of the shooting.

Also indicted was Lorrie’s  
18-year-old boyfriend who was  
allegedly involved in the Septem-  
ber shooting incident.

**No Abortion**

Kalamazoo, Mich. — A  
judge refused to overturn a  
lower court ruling that prohi-  
bited an abortion for an 11-year-  
old girl who is 23 weeks preg-  
nant by her mother’s boyfriend.

The girl is a ward of the  
county Probate Court and  
judges have refused to allow her  
father, an ex-convict who is  
divorced from the girl’s mother,  
to be named legal guardian, or  
receive temporary custody. The  
father has agreed to an abor-  
tion for his daughter.

**Investigate FBI**

London — Amnesty Inter-  
national claimed the FBI fabri-  
cated evidence and used other  
means to put the leaders of  
black, Indian and other Ameri-  
can minority groups behind bars.

Amnesty, which campaigns  
worldwide for the release of  
political prisoners and regularly  
criticizes authoritarian regimes  
for alleged human rights viola-  
tions, said an investigation  
should center on the trials of  
Black Panther leader Elmer Pratt  
in 1972 and American Indian  
Movement leader Richard Mar-  
shail in 1976.

Both men were convicted of  
murder and sentenced to life  
prison terms. Amnesty said they  
were “convicted... after being  
targeted for FBI intelligence  
action.”

Both men claim they are  
political prisoners framed by the  
FBI through fabrication of evi-  
dence and the deliberate with-  
holding of “vital information by  
the authorities.”

**DWI**

Milton, Vt. — School Super-  
intendent Michael A. Nason has  
been fined $180 in Vermont  
District Court for driving while  
intoxicated in Shelburne in  
August.

Deputy State’s Atty. Nancy  
Sheehan said Nason’s right to  
drive will be suspended for one  
year. Nason could get his license  
back in 90 days if he success-  
fully completes the CRASH  
program, the state’s alcohol  
education and awareness course.

Nason told the officer that  
stopped him that he is Milton's  
police commissioner and respon-  
sible for hiring town policemen.  
He also told him that State’s  
Attorney Mark Keller is his  
friend.

Keller said such claims to  
police tend to reduce any  
inclination by the prosecution to  
plea bargain.

The officer said Nason had a  
.18 breath test result. Under  
Vermont law, .10 percent is the  
presumptive level for intoxica-  
tion.

Milton school board chair-  
man James Rowley said the  
board would decline comment  
on the incident.

**Racism**

Windham, Conn. — State  
troopers outnumbered Ku Klux  
Klansmen at a weekend cross-  
burning in this eastern Connec-  
ticut town after an anti-Klan  
march resulted in eight arrests.

About 150 people, includ-  
ing 22 robed Klansmen and  
about 30 reporters, attended the  
KKK rally under the watch of  
200 state troopers.

State police spokesman  
John McLeod said the rally and  
cross-burning ceremonies went  
peacefully, with one arrest on a  
drug charge made.

**Good Pay?**

My friend and I were hitch-  
hiking, and learned this inter-  
esting information. The man  
who picked us up has been  
working as a pipe fitter for nu-  
clear power plants for the past  
13 years. He earns $16 per hour,  
works 12 hours per day, 7 days  
per week. BUT due to radia-  
tion safety levels, he is only in  
the radiation area working for  
two 45-minute shifts per week.  
So he actually works an hour  
and a half for $1600 per week.  
The rest of his working day is  
spent in the nuke plant lounge  
drinking coffee, playing cards,  
sleeping. In three months he  
accumulates his maximum safe  
level of radiation, or the equi-  
valent of 48 chest x-rays. Then  
he rests a while and moves on  
to another plant. We told him  
to keep his pipes tight.

**Etana Finkler**

Knoxville, Tenn. — Women  
have a constitutional right to  
bare their breasts in public, the  
state Court of Appeals said in  
striking down a Chattanooga  
city ordinance.

Judge James W. Parrott’s  
opinion said courts since 1975  
have ruled that a woman’s right  
to expose her breasts is guaran-  
teed by the First and 14th  
Amendments, which protect  
freedom of expression.  
The ruling reversed and  

dismissed a Hamilton County  
court decision against two  
women found guilty of violating  
the city ordinance, which prohi-  
bits exposure of female breasts  
and touching or fondling of  
female breasts in public.  
Parrott’s opinion said ordi-  
nances against exposing breasts  
have been ruled legal only when  
they applied to establishments  
selling alcoholic beverages.

**D.C. Education**

Six members of the  
Women’s Liberation Zap Action  
Brigade have been found guilty  
of “disrupting Congress” and  
fined $100 each. The women  
were arrested on April 23 for  
yelling pro-abortion sentiments  
at a sub-committee hearing on  
the “Human Life Statute” which  
defines life as beginning at con-  
ception.

They faced an all-black  
jury comprised of 7 women and  
5 men. According to one defen-  
dant, Loie Hayes, they admit-  
ted as part of their defense an  

intent to “educate,” not “dis-  
rupt,” Congress. The six got  
many opportunities to talk  

about abortion rights and the  

bill during the trial, and some in  
their post-sentencing statements  
identified themselves as lesbian  
feminists committed to working  
for abortion rights and auto-  
nomy for all women.

The D.C. records, dating  
back 8 years, do not show any  
other party convicted on the  
“disrupting Congress” charge. In  
fact, on a few occasions those  
who have spoken up at hearings  
have been invited to testify.  
With anti-abortion Senator John  
East chairing the hearings, it’s  
obvious why this wasn't the case  
this time. Only anti-abortion tes-  
timony was heard.

The case is being appealed  
and donations are needed. Send

**Dessie Woods FREE!**

In February, 1976, Dessie Woods, a young black woman  
from Atlanta, was convicted in South Georgia of manslaughter  
and armed robbery for killing Ronnie Horne, a white insurance  
salesman who tried to rape her and her friend Cheryl Todd. In  
June of the previous year, the two women were hitchhiking back  
to Atlanta after making an emergency visit to Ms. Todd’s brother  
in Reidsville prison. After being picked up by Horne, who told a  
friend over his CB radio to meet him, that he had “two Black  
Muslim women” in the woods, Horne pulled a gun on them and  
tried to rape them. In the ensuing struggle, Horne was killed with  
his own unlicensed gun. Cheryl Todd panicked and they took  
money from his wallet to get home to Atlanta. For this act of  
self-defense, some eight months later Ms. Woods was sentenced to  

22 years in prison.

On July 9, 1981, Dessie Woods was released from prison. In  
the six years of her being jailed, there were many attempts by  
lawyers, by her national defense committee, as well as by thou-  
sands of individuals and numerous organizations to free her.  
Those six long years Dessie Woods spent her life in prison for a  
“crime” which sharply points out the racism and elitism of the  
so-called American justice system. If the “victim” had been a  
poor black man, and the person who shot him a middle or ruling-  
class white woman, there would not only be no conviction but  

no arrest.

Many of you are familiar with the Dessie Woods case and  
will rejoice with us in her freedom. But there is still a need for  
money. Dessie Woods needs money to get back on her feet, to  
pay lawyers, to do national publicity about what happened to  
her, to raise her children. Won't you join us in making as large  
a contribution as possible to Dessie Woods? Thank you.
