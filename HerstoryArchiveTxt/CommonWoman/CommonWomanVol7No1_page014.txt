Sexuality Enhancement

(continued from page 5)

our pleasure. The more alive we
are, the more feeling we have.
Many women in our culture are
taught to shut off their sexual
feelings and to not discuss their
feelings about sex. Many feelings
are expressed in the groups. The
rage over having one’s sexuality
dominated and defined by men,
the pain of not feeling adequate
as a sexual being, of comparing
oneself to others and always
coming up short; the fear of
having one’s sexual preference
ridiculed and discounted if it is
exposed; to the joys of having
one’s first orgasm, or telling
your lover what you really want
and finding out how good it
feels to get your needs met —
these are the types of feelings
women share.

Another exercise in the
program is to write a letter to
your genitals expressing your
feelings and thoughts, and then
having your genitals write you
back. “L,” a woman in one of
the groups, had been having
difficulty doing any of the
self-pleasuring, masturbation
exercises at home. She had never
touched her genitals or given
herself an orgasm; that was her
husband's job. She shared with
the group that she felt ridiculous
and silly touching herself, or
making noises — it all seemed
like such a bore. After she wrote
a despairing letter to her geni-
tals, she had them write her
back. It was a moving experi-
ence. The next week she

bounded into group filled with

excitement — she had given
herself the wildest, noisiest,
most wonderful orgasm she had
ever had, and realized indeed,
that she and her genitals were in
partnership, living in the same
body, for the first time.

The behavioral component
to our sexuality is how we act
out or express our sexual iden-
tity; it includes how we go about
getting our sexual needs met and
how we behave sexually. Some
people have a limited range or
repertoire of sexual behaviors or
ways of expressing sexual needs.
Most of us have never discussed
our techniques for sexual
arousal, or specifically how we
like to be touched. Few of us
have ever sat down and told a
lover the type of stroking,
amount of pressure, kind of
friction and lubrication we need.
Many women begin the program
having no idea what turns them

on. One woman discovered that

she loved to kiss. She stopped
having intercourse for a while
and started to experiment with
her partner in kissing. The
kissing led to nibbling, which
then led to sucking and licking
and for the first time she was
having hours of pleasure just by
using her mouth.

The importance of commu-
nication is stressed repeatedly
throughout the program. People
role play asking for what they
want from friends or partners, in
clear, direct language. Partici-
pants are taught to use “I”
statements, avoid mindreading,
to check out assumptions and to
avoid getting into the “I’m right,
she’s wrong” game playing in
communication. Most women
haven't had much practice talk-
ing about sex and one of the
fears that often comes up when
we talk about asking, is the fear
of rejection.

One woman “P” had a fear
that if she told her partner that
she didn’t like the way she
stroked her breasts, that her
partner would be devastated and
reject “P.” It took several weeks
to sort out disappointment and
rejection. Her partner might be
disappointed and would prob-
ably not reject her. “P” also
worked on describing how it was
she did like to have her breasts
touched so that she could
communicate this as well.

Anytime we risk asking for
what we want, we risk not
getting it, but the more we ask,
the greater are our chances of
getting our needs met. And
so, in the course of the program,
women share their fears and
their wants; their successes and
their failures.

Other topics are also
covered in the program. Issues
such as erotica and fantasy,
body image, self-help, mono-
gamy, lesbianism, celibacy, and
spirituality are often raised.
Sometimes group members will
want a specific topic discussed in
order to get new ideas or
thoughts, or to share her own.
The program is designed around
the homework that is assigned
every week. Participants do
journal work, body exercises,

communication work and read.
The group time is spent on
discussions or some interactional
exercises. One session is spent
viewing films and in some groups
we do self-speculum exams and a
night on self-help. Half of the
battle for many of the partici-
pants is just making the time for
themselves in the course of their
hectic days. Taking time out to
look at their bodies, to take a
candlelight bubble bath or to
read a book is sometimes pain-
fully difficult. Often a woman
will share that her sex life
amounts to going through some
very tired sets of motions at the
end of an exhausting week. The
complaint that sex is boring is
not uncommon. The realization
that anything we do over and
over again in the same manner is
bound to become boring and
mindless is often startling. Some-
times women are surprised when
they find out that they have to
work (in the sense of planning)
to bring more sexual play and
variation into their lives, and
that they, not their partners, are
responsible for their own sexual
satisfaction.

The program always ends
with some form of celebration.
One group brought erotic art
that they had made that cele-
brated their sexuality; hot tubs and
parties often occur. One of the
joys of facilitating these groups
is in watching the support
systems grow over the course of
the program and to watch the
friendships unfold. Some of the
most unlikely types become
friends.

I find the groups a constant
source of challenge and joy. As a
facilitator I share my own
experiences, my limitations, and
my fears. I always come away

from each group refreshed and
energized. The joy of loving me
rises up in the process of sharing
and learning with other women.
The sexuality groups are
open to all women of any age or
sexual preference. They cost
$12/week for eight weeks and are
offered dependent on demand.
Sliding-fee scale available.

Vaginitis
(continued from page 5)

it seem
Where is
that odor coming

from?!

Researchers have shown
that the bacteria cling to epithe-
lial cells that have normally
sloughed off the vaginal mucosa.
The bacteria is living off (parasi-
tizing) the cell and utilizing the
glycogen (sugar) stores. The
odor is the result of this process,
a chemical by-product called an
“amine.” The bacteria seems
unable to invade the intact
vaginal mucosa or travel into the
uterus to cause a pelvic infec-
tion. There are some rare excep-
tions, in those cases where the
woman may be more susceptible
because of other disease condi-
tions. Usually there are no or
few white blood cells seen in the
wet mount when “clue cells” are
present. This indicates that the
organism is not causing the body
to activate its immune or
defense system. This is why
many researchers feel “G.V.”
does not classify as a true
“infection.” Research has also
shown that the organism
responds to increases in estrogen
and to changes in the pH (aci-
dity) of the vagina. The increase
in estrogen tends to increase the
amount of glycogen and there-
fore the amount of “G.V.”
Many women have an increase in
symptoms before they bleed or
soon after they bleed. Estrogen
levels may be responsible in both
cases. A change in pH, that is a
shift to a more basic pH, may
also allow “G.V.” to grow more
readily. The normal pH of the
vagina is about 4.6. Women
with symptoms of “G.V.”
usually have a pH of 5.0-5.5.
Diet, stress, and exposure to
agents with basic pH may result
in classic symptoms. Hetero-
sexually active women often
report flare-ups after intercourse.
Semen is very alkaline and could
provide the basic pH necessary
to encourage overgrowth of
normal flora.

While this information
speaks for the case that “G.V.”
is part of the normal flora and
when given the correct environ-
ment will overgrow producing
the classic symptoms,
researchers have also shown that
partners of women with “G.V.”
also harbor the organism. Male
partners may harbor the organ-
ism in the prostate gland. They
very rarely develop any symp-
toms. Investigators feel that the
low level of glycogen in male
urethral cells and the constant
flushing of urination prevent
symptoms, but the organism
could be spread with the ejacula-
tion. Lesbian women may be
exposed to the organism with
genital contact and exposure to
vaginal discharge containing the
organism. In this context, we
could consider the organism to
produce a sexually transmitted
disease. So, it seems that the
organism can be part of the
normal flora and/or transferred
sexually.

How you define the type of
‘vaginitis’ you have will have an
effect on the type of treatment
you choose, if any at all. In
keeping with the history of the
organism, the recommended
treatments are also varied
depending on what you read or
who you talk to. If you decide
that “G.V.” is part of your
normal flora and cyclically over-
grows to produce symptoms,
you may feel comfortable treat-
ing yourself symptomatically. If
the reason for the overgrowth is
the influence of alkaline agents
in the vagina, you can remove
those agents or help revert the
vagina back to its acid pH by
doing a vinegar and water
douche (2 tbs. to 1 qt. warm
water). The frequency of douch-
ing may depend on every indivi-
dual woman and it is important
to remember that too much
douching may cause more prob-
lems than the "G.V." Betadine
douches, Betadine gels, Aci-jel or
a sulfa-containing vaginal cream
(Sultrin) may also be helpful. It
is generally thought that the acid
pH of these preparations is the
beneficial factor as opposed to
the specific agents. Several oral
preparations have been suggested
as helpful also; Ampicillin and
metronidazole (Flagyl). Metro-
nidazole is now considered the
drug of choice by some medical
facilities. Because this drug has
been shown to produce cancer
when given in large doses to lab
animals, it would be important
to balance possible side effects
of the treatment with the
symptoms of the “disease.” If
the symptoms are considered the
result of a sexually transmitted
disease, the next step would be
to treat partners even if they are
not exhibiting symptoms. It is
recommended that female part-
ners participate in the same
treatment chosen by the women.
If Ampicillin or metronidazole
are chosen, male partners should
participate in the same treatment. If
the woman chooses a douche or
vaginal preparation, the male
may choose to use Ampicillin or
metronidazole. Because it is
unknown how long the organism
would survive in the prostate, it
may also be helpful for the male
partner to use a condom for the
period of treatment and to
ejaculate frequently in order to
rinse the organism from the
system.

Treatment is not always
successful and many women find
themselves dealing with the
symptoms several times. If the
bacteria is viewed as part of the
normal flora that occasionally
overgrows, it seems easier to
cope with the symptoms. It is
important for every woman to
decide the appropriate treatment
for herself, once given all the in-
formation.

As with any health-related
issue, the more we understand
and can relate to our own speci-
fic situation, the better health
care we can provide ourselves.

The Vermont Women’s

health center. $5.00 fee (more
if you can, less if you can’t).
Preregister by phone, 863-1386.
This workshop is offered by

Kate Nicholas and Rachel
Atkins. Content addresses issues
for women of all sexual orien-
tations.

My Body
as Other

(continued from page 7)

I found these resources
helpful in reclaiming my reality
as an ill woman: Nice Jewish
Girls, This Bridge Called My
Back, Off Our Backs disability
issue (May 1980) and various
articles in women’s periodicals.

P.S. Please think twice
before dousing yourself with
strongly perfumed oils, scents
and lotions. Many ill women are
sensitive to chemicals and scents
and become nauseated from the
smell.

Stephanie Sugars: I am a
cyclically ill, young, white work-
ing-class woman living in rural
Northern California. My time is
filled with reading, resting,
friends, political, feminist, and
anti-war education and action
and a half-time bookkeeping job.
Because this is the first thing I
ever wrote about illness and it is
addressed to the lesbian com-
munity, I left out a lot of very
important things about illness
like: Hospitals, Medical Deities,
SSI/SSDI, other forms of eco-
nomic survival, drugs, death,
media attitudes toward illness,
illness in literature, depression,
and despair, the hostile en-
vironment, Reaganomics, “pro-
fessional attitudes” toward ill
people, and class attitudes. I do
not feel well enough thought-out
about any of these to write
about them now. I hope they
will be dealt with at some time. 
I would like to live to see the
world change.
