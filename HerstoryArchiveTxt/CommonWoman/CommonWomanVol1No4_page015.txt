Immediately following her
conviction, Ms. Berster was
transferred to New York City’s

Federal Metropolitan

Correctional Center (MCC). The
next phase of legal ordeals for
the 28-year-old West German
involves administrative hearings
by the INS. At the present time,
either of two proceedings may
be initiated — exclusionary or
deportation. Exclusionary
proceedings are held when the

INS determines that an alien is

technically not within the

jurisdiction of the United States.

This situation usually occurs at a

border and is used to prevent

actual entry into the country. In

Ms. Berster’s case, INS could

rule she was not far enough

within the U.S. to constitute
entry. In practical terms, this
translates to proverbial

“footsteps in the night” at the

MCC as agents hold only the

bare minimum of a “hearing”

and order her expulsion. Ms.

Berster’s supporters fear such a

hearing would result in her

direct return to West Germany.

The second type of
proceeding involves the INS
reaching a determination as to
whether an individual may be

ordered out of the U.S. for a

variety of reasons specified by

statute. Some of these reasons
include illegal entry,
membership in a foreign

“subversive” group and

conviction in this country of a

felony. A defense to deportation

is a claim of political asylum.

Applicants for asylum must
prove that they are legal refugees

and that they will be subjected

to actual physical persecution
upon return to their homelands
for previous political opposition
to the government. This is an
enormously heavy burden of
proof for the applicant to meet
since asylum is rarely granted

for individuals fleeing nations which
are foreign policy allies of the
U.S. An example of this
arbitrary use of asylum criteria

There is yet one more crucial
court hearing to be held in
Burlington on a date yet to be
announced. At this hearing
Judge Coffrin will issue a
sentence in this “normal
immigration case." More

importantly, defense attorneys
will argue that the repressive bail
of $100,000 be lowered and that
Ms. Berster be freed pending
appeal.

In addition, attorney

William Kunstler will urge that
may be drawn from two cases in
point. An individual from
Batista’s Cuba was granted
asylum despite lack of proof of
any political work in his
homeland and the fact that he
had been convicted of a moral
turpitude felony in a U.S. court.
On the other hand, Haitians are
daily returned to sure death
under Duvalier’s regime ignoring
reams of testimony and
documentary evidence
supportive of their asylum
claims.

Asylum claims are entirely

within the “discretionary”
powers of the INS. Berster’s
attorneys are preparing for these
hearings by gathering affidavits
and other legal proofs to force
the INS to allow European
witnesses to testify as to the
repressive natures of the West
German prison and court
systems.

Meanwhile, Ms. Berster is held
at the MCC, a prison largely
staffed with ex-military police.
Harassment tactics have
included “disappearance” of

money deposited in her
commissary account and reading
materials left with officials
according to prison regulations.
The authorities have also
attempted to create animosity
toward Ms. Berster by telling
other inmates she is a “convicted
terrorist.” Despite these tactics,
the largely Third World inmate
populace is beginning to express
solidarity with her fight for
freedom.
U.S. Attorney William Grey may
be held in contempt of court for
releasing the names of countries
she traveled through during her
five-year struggle for survival.
The government and the defense
had entered into a sealed
stipulation during the trial that
these countries be named as “A”
and “B” to prevent further
charges under German law. This
agreement was finalized by
Coffrin’s agreement at the
bench. Grey volunteered the
actual names of the countries to
the press less than twenty
minutes after the verdicts had
been returned and continues to
demonstrate the callous
disregard for Ms. Berster’s life
displayed by the government
throughout the trial. In the
alternative, Kunstler will move
the court to set aside the
verdicts based upon Grey's act
of government misconduct.
Berster’s supporters
emphasize that the struggle to
prevent her return to West
Germany, certain imprisonment
and probable physical harm has
reached a critical stage.
Concerned individuals are urged

to write INS Commissioner
Leomel Castillo, Immigration
and Naturalization Service,
Washington, D.C. 20536,
supporting her asylum
application. The defense

committee is also mounting a
nationwide petition drive to

block deportation. For more
information and to send
desperately needed
contributions, write the

committee at Box 144,
Winooski, Vermont, 05404, or
