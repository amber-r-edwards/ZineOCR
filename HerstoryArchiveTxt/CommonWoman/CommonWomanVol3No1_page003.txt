Rapes & Assaults

According to Deputy State's  
Attorney Susan Via, there were  

seven reported rapes and a  
sexual assault in Chittenden  
County in November. They  

included two rapes and a sexual  
assault in Shelburne, the “alleged”  
gang rape of two women in  
Williston (for which four men  
have been arrested), and rapes in  
Colchester, Milton, and Under-  
hill. All the rapes are unresolved.  

A 20-year-old St. Michael's  
College student reported that  
she was raped on campus  
December 11 about 7 p.m. The  
assailant was described as  
blonde, 6’1" tall, and about 200  
pounds. The rape occurred on  
the athletic field between Camp  
Johnson and Fort Ethan Allen.  

Harold Wyman Jackson of  
Rutland faced fugitive from  
justice charges in Rutland on the  
basis of a rape charge lodged in  
New York. His lawyer, Public  
Defender Holly Harris, said  
Jackson would fight extradition  
and that her client maintains the  
charge should have been lodged  
in Vermont.  

A jury of ten men and two  
women deliberated four hours  
and acquitted Clinton Dodge of  
Rutland of three charges of rape  
in Rutland on December 4. At  
issue in the trial was not whether  
the sexual acts took place, but  
whether they were against the  
woman's will. Dodge's lawyer  
maintained that the woman  
enticed his client by her actions  
in the incident.  

Dennis Longe, pardoned by  
Governor Snelling for a rape in  
Lamoille County in December  
1977, pleaded guilty to charges  
of armed robbery and attempted  
sexual assault on a store clerk in  
Essex Junction. Armed robbery  
carries a sentence of 15 years in  
jail. Attempted sexual assault  
carries a sentence of 10 years in  
jail and up to a $10,000 fine.  
State’s Attorney Mark J. Keller  
dropped a charge of lewd and  
lascivious conduct in Jericho  

against Longe in exchange for  
the guilty pleas. Longe had  
served 18 months of a two-to-  
five-year sentence for the  
Lamoille County rape for which  

he was pardoned in 1977.  

Franka Slattery, a 4'10”  

woman, grabbed the knife from  
an attacker in Rutland and  
speared him in the thigh. Ray-  
mond T. Hughes, Jr. was arraign-  
ed in Vermont District Court on  
charges of attempted kidnapping  
and aggravated assault. The  
incident happened in Ms. Slat-  
tery’s car in a parking garage  
December 11.  

A 62-year-old man was  
accused of assaulting a woman  
with a running chainsaw in  
Sunderland on November 18.  
Richard C. Butler was released  
on $500 bail after pleading  
innocent to the charge of  
aggravated assault. The victim,  
Gertrude Brown, was hit just  
below the knee and just above  
the ankle with the saw. Butler  
said he had been drinking and  
couldn’t remember the incident.  
The charge carries a penalty of  
15 years in jail and/or a fine of  
$10,000.  

Meanwhile, in two other  
states, women who have testified  
against their rapists have been  
attacked or killed in retaliation.  
A 30-year-old woman has been  
attacked three times in Cleve-  
land, Ohio, twice in retaliation  
for her testimony against the  
first attacker. She was raped all  
three times. Police have four  
men in custody in the case. The  
woman is now in hiding.  

In Kansas City, Mo., three  
rape victims who had agreed to  
testify against their attackers  
have been killed. The latest was  
a 40-year-old physically handi-  
capped woman. Federal funds  
are reportedly being sought to  
provide protection for witnesses.  
There has been no mention  
of arrests in connection with the  
slayings.  

Candidates  

Illinois Congressman John  
B. Anderson, a Republican can-  
didate for the presidency, has  
advocated federal responsibility  
for child care for working  
mothers if private day care  
centers cannot fill the need. He  
said he did not agree with others  
that day care is a threat to  
family ties. Representative  
James Jeffords (R-VT) has given  
his endorsement to Anderson.  

Anderson also proposes a 50-  
cent hike in federal gasoline  
taxes as a conservation measure.  

Another Republican presi-  
dential candidate, Sen. Howard  
Baker, said he “might” consider  
a woman for a vacancy on the  
Supreme Court if elected. He  
also said he opposes busing as a  
method of achieving school  
desegregation.

State News  

Sister Elizabeth Candon,  
head of the Human Services  
Agency in Vermont, has recom-  
mended that the Governor's  
Commission on the Status of  
Women be funded by some  
other agency or seek outside  
funding. Sister Candon said she  
made the recommendation  
because the commission (and  
two others also funded by the  
Human Services Agency) is an  
advocacy group which is sup-  
posed to monitor programs of  
the agency. She suggested it  
would be hard to strenuously  
criticize the group which funds  
an organization. The two other  
commissions included in the  
recommendation are the Gover-  
nor’s Commissions on Children  
and Youth and on Employment  
of the Handicapped. Last year,  
$15,000 was cut from the  
budget of the Commission on  
Women by the state legislature.  
This year, the commission has  
reportedly sent its budget  
request to the governor's office.  

The United States Office of  
Education has granted $51,000  
to Vermont to help eliminate  
sexism in public schools and in  
school materials. The money will  
be administered by the state  
Department of Education and  
used to train teachers locally,  
train women as school adminis-  
trators, and monitor school  
compliance with federal regula-  
tions on equal opportunity for  
students of both sexes. Some of  
the money may be used to buy a  
small reference library on elimi-  
nating sex-role stereotyping.  

The Governor’s Commission  
on the Status of Women has not  
yet taken action on a recom-  
mendation from one of its  
committees that the commission  
support abortion rights and fight  
attempts by the state legislature  
to deprive Planned Parenthood  
of Vermont of over $500,000 in  
federal and state funding. The  
funding threat to Planned  
Parenthood comes from state  
Senator Chester P. Scott, R-  
Windsor, because of his objec-  
tion to Planned Parenthood’s  
abortion clinic in Rutland. The  
clinic receives no public funds.  
Public funding does, however, go  
to counseling services and distri-  
bution of contraceptives.  

Gay Foster  
Parents  

New Jersey officials in the  
foster care program have placed  
homosexual teenagers with  
homosexual parents in an  
apparent victory for gays against  
the “child molester” stereotype.  
At least two of the homes are  
headed by lesbians, one single,  
the other a couple.  

Federal News  

In late November, the U.S.  
Supreme Court ruled, in effect,  
that the government may not  
pressure school districts which  
discriminate against women em-  
ployees by withholding federal  
money. That interpretation  
comes from the Supreme Court's  
refusal to hear appeals on  
a lower court ruling that “Title  
IX” does not apply to schools’  
employment practices. “Title  
IX” is the federal law which  
requires equal opportunity in  
education.  

At the same time, the  
Supreme Court said it “may”  
decide whether Congressionally-  
imposed restrictions on abortion  
spending are constitutional. But  
they must decide whether they  
have the proper jurisdiction to  

consider the case. A federal  
judge in Illinois struck down  
both the state and federal  

spending restrictions in a ruling  
last April. The Carter adminis-  
tration, the state of Illinois, and  
a group called Americans United  
for Life Legal Defense Fund are  
appealing that ruling. The Hyde  
Amendment, which contains the  
federal restrictions on Medicaid  
spending for abortion, this year  
bans spending on abortion unless  
a woman's life would be endan-  
gered by childbirth, or except in  
cases of “promptly reported”  
rape or incest, the most restric-  
tive wording yet.  

The U.S. House of Repre-  
sentatives voted recently to give  
individual states the right to  
refuse to spend Medicaid money  
on abortion, even if the mother's  
life is in danger. Vermont Rep.  
James Jeffords voted against the  
bill. The vote was termed a  
victory for anti-abortion forces.  
The bill was attached to a  
Medicaid bill which would ex-  
tend benefits to additional wom-  
en and children. The Senate  
has not acted on the Medicaid  
bill to date.  

Religion/ERA  

Sonia Johnson, feminist and  
fifth-generation Mormon, was  
excommunicated in December  
by the Mormon Church. Church  
officials said that she was  
excommunicated for preaching  
false doctrine and undermining  
the authority of the church's  
leadership. Johnson says she was  
excommunicated because of her  
work on behalf of the Equal  
Rights Amendment.  

Pornography  

Four people, two women  
and two men, apparently set off  
a stink bomb in Studio C II, a  
nude dancing club in Rutland.  
They were caught and detained  
for police before they could  
reach their car. Fifty people  
were evacuated and given  
refunds of their $5 one-night  
membership fees. Owner John  
Gray of Rutland said he  
planned to have the club fumiga-  
ted to get rid of the smell.  

The windows of a  
bookstore, called Bookland, in  

Newport, were shot out with a  
handgun police found in  
November. There has been a  
campaign to drive the bookstore  
out of town by area clergymen.  
Police say they have a suspect,  
but no direct evidence as to who  
did it.  

Meanwhile, the adult book-  
store in St. Johnsbury was to be  
closed for lack of business. The  
owner said he would review his  
operation in Newport also to see  
if it was worth staying open.  

WOMEN’S HOUSE  
IN CRISIS  

By Renee, Women’s House  
of Transition  

I've been wanting to write  
about the Women’s House of  
Transition for a long time. I  
don’t feel confident in my  
writing skills; I keep putting it  
off; I'm scared of being angry...  
but I want to put this out as best  
I can.  

I see shelters for battered  
women and their children as an  
important feminist issue. I have  
gotten a lot of energy and joy  
from working on this project,  
too. The Women’s House has  

existed about four years. We  
offer temporary shelter and  
support to women who have  
been abused and/or threatened.  
We have a 24-hour hotline and  
offer community resource infor-  
mation and referrals. We do a lot  
of listening with women who are  
scared and women who are  
angry.  

The shelter, which we (the  
corporation) own, is run as a  
self-help shelter. The women  
there are given a lot of responsi-
