Joan Knight's Photographs  
By Lynn Vera  
Joan Knight hung an exhibit  
of her photographs in the EWP  

gallery earlier this fall. I was  
excited about seeing it and  
planned to review it as I've  

admired Joan's work for years  
now, I expected — and found —  
fine quality work. Sharp, clear,  
flawless prints, the kind that  
come from careful film process-  
ing and negative care. It’s no  
small point — a spoiled negative  
is the end of what could have  
been a breath-stopping image.  
What I also found, less pre-  
sumed, was diversity in both  
subject and technique.  

The photographs were al-  
most solely Black and White.  
With none of the protection/  
camouflage of Kodachrome  
(color), B&W photographs touch  
me as more basic somehow —  
naked and real and very clearly  
honest. A photograph? Yes, they  
affect me this way. To me, a  
photograph is good if it makes  
me feel something. I want to  
look again, or even touch.  
Maybe I can know, from look-  
ing, what the mood of that  
caught moment was.  

Even now, a month later,  
I remember some of Joan’s photo-

I know this wordscape, the  
shadows and sounds and tastes  
behind Obasan. I thought a  
Japanese Canadian novel about  
World War II would be different  
from a Japanese American novel  
about World War II. It was the  
same yet different. Obasan is a  
powerful interpenetration of  
dream reality and waking rea-  
lity: “Silent Mother you do not  
speak or write. You do not reach  

through the night to enter  
morning, but remain in the  
voicelessness... How shall I  

attend that speech, Mother, how  

shall I trace that wave?”  
Through all the war years  

and beyond, Naomi does not  

know her mother’s fate; Naomi’s  

grief and pain about the loss of  
her mother forms a microcosm  
of the macrocosmic loss of  
community and home that all  
west coast Japanese Canadians  
faced during World War II. At  
thirty-six, Naomi learns through  
a package sent to her by her  
Aunt Emily how her mother  
died and was buried beneath a  
Canadian maple tree in Japan, a  
victim of the bombing of Naga-  

saki Japan and Canada are not  

separate after all; Naomi’s basic  
experience contains both. I read  
this and I remember my war-  
bride mother: the connectedness  
of Japan and America for me.  
Kogawa’s and my experience  
speak to each other and form a  
larger whole.

graphs, the ones that give me  
“the feeling.” A wall of women  
in action stood out, her docu-  
mentary photos, the note read.  
Very large and beautifully  
matted without borders so that  
the images seemed to overflow  
and be nearly real, these photos  
were of different Vermont  
women at rallies, demonstrations  
and events. Here were women  
with microphones, banners,  
muscles, children, musical instru-  
ments — women being passion-  
ate and proud, defiant and  
strong. These are photos that  
give back time, that serve to  
energize and empower. I heard  
women commenting “remember  
when we did that,” and “that  
whole hall gasped when she said  
that” and “Oh I sure miss Witch  
I... we need a women’s dance  
band again.” Pieces of our  
herstory — they won’t be in  
school books, or most news-  
papers, and without them per-  
haps with time we’d forget, or  
our children would never know  
— just as “they” would like.  
When women photograph each  
other with the kind of respect  
that emanates from these  
photos, we resist straight media’s  
incessant attempt to deny our  
presence and our effect. When I  
see Joan and other women with  

cameras (yes, little instamatics  
too) at events of celebration  
and/or resistance, I get excited,  
and relieved. We need to believe  
in each other, and photographs  
help us remember.  

A little aside about this... in  
talking about using photographs  
to document our lives, I need to  
stress how important it is to  
include as many of our lives as is  
possible — not necessarily easy,  
but possible. Lots of women  
living good lives and doing all  
kinds of valuable work are  
victims of media block... we  
never see them. I mean women  
in chairs or with other disabili-  
ties, some women of color, large  
or fat women, I am not wanting  
to be at all rhetorical. The issue  
is real and essential and I  
couldn't do this photographic  
ramble without naming it.  

So yes, I liked the docu-  
mentary wall. There were other  
photos that touched me,  
especially the ones of children.  
A certain eye contact, an unself-  
conscious expression or move-  
ment captured, that special open  
joy that is children... Joan's  
images of kids are fun, and  
beckoning. I liked all of the  
portraits — really, and was  
impressed with the skilled but  
subtle lighting work. With com-  

binations of natural and  
engineered light, Joan was able  
to create portraits with clarity  
while maintaining a sense of  
mood and intensity. That's hard  
— lighting is hard, and Joan’s  
gotten good at it. Anyway,  
the kids’ photos touched me  
specifically. I’ve been thinking  
about them though — I want to  
see more images of Lesbians and  
other single-parent women with  
kids. We do it; we've evolved all  
kinds of extended family setups  
to help make it easier, and we  
need to see this. Motherhood is  
valuable work, and it’s often  
buried. For fear of losing our  

kids we often maintain low  
profiles as Lesbian mothers. So  
low that we may not even know  
each other, or how many of us  
there are. The “regular” media  
hits us hard with “family”  
images — we need more of our  
own. Joan had one like this —  
she pulled it from her family  
album. She and her daughter are  
playing outside in the country  
with Susan and Carol, neighbors  
and friends who help with  
parenting. That is exciting, en-  
couraging, important; I loved  
that photo. I did also like the  
action/mood that Joan “caught”  
in the photo of the little boy  
with his mom and dad — but it  
was so all-American that I found  
myself resistant. I wanted to see  
more women with kids on these

Mouse, a Bachelor of Advanced  
Activists and General Practition-  
er of Just Causes.” In a subtle  
way, Aunt Emily and Naomi are  
allied: “Why indeed are there  
two of us unmarried in our small  
family? Must be something in  
our blood. A crone-prone syn-  
drome. We should hire ourselves  
out for a research study, Aunt  
Emily and I.” Why indeed? I  
sense another novel here, only  
barely evoked beneath the wel-  
ter of details about a Japanese  
Canadian family’s fate during  
World War II.  

Ultimately, Obasan while  
being herself evokes an image of  
the old Japanese culture torn  
apart by war and Japanese  

militarism; she is the old ways,  

the silent suffering land that  
endures both natural and man-  
made disasters. Yet, it is Naomi  
herself who holds me to the  
novel: I wonder if she is not a  
subtle rebel, rebelling both  
against the old style Japanese  
woman who she refuses to be  
and the white images of Japan-  
ese exotic erotics.  

Or even worse, the pitiful  
minority that liberals feel guilty  
about: “Ah, here we go again.  
‘Our Indians.’ ‘Our Japanese.’ ‘A  
terrible business.’ It’s like being  
offered a pair of crutches while  
I’m striding down the street...  
These are icebreaker questions  
that create an awareness of ice.”  
Combined with the lightness,  
grace and humor of the novel is  
the pain of abandonment, betra-  
yal and non-protect that the  

camps evoked. In Canada, unlike  
the U.S., fathers and husbands  
were separated from children  
and wives. Naomi was an orphan  
during World War II and after;  
she only had Obasan and her  
great uncle for protection; they  
were nearly as helpless as she  
was. Her mother’s sister, Emily  
was sent to another area of  
Canada; Naomi and Aunt Emily  
don’t see each other for twelve  
years.  

Out of the chaos of World  
War II come two traditions: one  
feeding, forming the basis of the  
other. The older generation says,  
“kodomo no tame” (for the  
children’s sake) we must endure,  
be serene, keep living with as  
much dignity as we can muster  
in the midst of humiliation and  
shame. We will keep our pain  
from the children. Naomi says  
for the younger generation:  
“The body of grief is not fit for  
human habitation. Let there be  
flesh. The song of mourning is  
not a lifelong song... How bright  
in the darkness the brooding  
light. How gentle the colours of  
rain.”  

Thank you, Joy, for this  
novel. It conveys a wholeness  
out of fragmentation that we of  
Japanese ancestry need to come  
to both individually and collec-  
tively. No matter what the pain  
was, we will mend whole and  
sing other songs. Really... we  
will. “Father, Mother, my rela-  
tives, my ancestors, we have  
come to the forest tonight where  
the colours all meet — red,  

yellow and blue. We have turned  
and returned to your arms as  
you turn to earth and form the  
forest floor... See how our  
stained fingers have read the  
seasons, and how our serving  
hands serve you still.”
