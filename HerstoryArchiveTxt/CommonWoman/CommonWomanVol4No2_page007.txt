COMMONWOMAN MARCH/APRIL, 1981

SATURDAYS

Governor's

Commission

By Maxine Merrick

The Governor's Commission
on the Status of Women (GCSW)
this year is devoting much
energy and support to the
Divorce, Support and Custody
Bill and special projects on
family violence and displaced
homemakers, according to the
executive director of the Com-
mission.

Executive Director Anne
Sarcka, who has been with the
Commission two-and-a-half years
and has a master’s degree in
Social Services, said the Divorce,
Support and Custody Bill has
been passed by the House of
Representatives but in six years
has never gotten to the Senate
floor. The bill would provide for
equitable support and custody

between divorcing spouses.
Members of the Commission
hope it will be passed this

year, Ms. Sarcka said.

Success of the Project
Against Domestic Violence,
which began a year ago, is also a
main objective of the Commis-
sion this year, Ms. Sarcka
said. The project, which provides
workshops and speakers on
domestic violence to various
groups and agencies throughout
Vermont, was established to
improve services to battered
women and children and to raise
public awareness of the problem.

The coordinator of the
Family Violence Project, Deane
Brittingham, is working closely
with the state Coalition Against
Domestic Violence to possibly
provide a focus for continuing
work on the issue after the
project is completed, Ms. Sarcka
added.

The Displaced Homemakers
project is a coalition of state
agencies and voluntary organiza-
tions to develop services specific
to the needs of women who
receive little financial support
and who no longer have families
supporting them, Ms. Sarcka
said.

The goal of the GCSW is “to
bring about an environment in
which Vermont women can
achieve full citizenship with all
rights, privileges, and responsibi-
lities,” Ms. Sarcka said.

The Commission’s role is to
cooperate with the governor on
women’s issues, to work for
public policies enabling women
to achieve full citizenship, to
offer information and referral on
issues concerning women and to
identify, research and work
toward solutions for the prob-
lems women face through a
number of projects initiated by

At this time, only two
positions on the Commission are
paid positions. Ms. Sarcka and
Rita Edwards, who has been
administrative assistant for four
years, are the only members of
the Commission on salary.

There are 16 commissioners
who work with these women to
bring expertise in various areas
of employment, finances, health
and legislation to the commis-
sion. There are also 35 members
on the advisory council who are

delegates from state councils
from the social, legal, govern-
mental and private sectors of
Vermont.

The office of the Commis-
sion, at 126 State Street, Mont-
pelier, is a “clearinghouse” for
information and referral to
increase awareness of the
barriers women face in achieving
equal status, Ms. Edwards said.

Ms. Edwards, of Chelsea,
Vt., said that more than 600
requests for information and
assistance were filled from July,
1979, to July, 1980, ranging
from pregnancy laws to employ-
ment information.

The GCSW puts out 10
publications, in conjunction
with other agencies around Ver-
mont, concerning women’s legal
rights, employment discrimina-
tion, credit rights and general
information about the Commis-
sion itself. There are also many
publications on international
and national women's news and
events available at the office, Ms.
Sarcka said.

WOMYN! Are you aware
that, for Christian lesbians, there
is access to a Christian church
here in Burlington where we are
an accepted part of the congre-
gation as acknowledged homo-
sexuals? We have an opportunity
here in Burlington to return to a
Christian religion without com-
promising our sexuality.

INTEGRITY/BURLING-
TON meets at St. Paul’s Cathe-
dral every third Saturday even-
ing of each month at 7:55 p.m.
for celebration of the Episcopal
Holy Eucharist and a social or
educational program following.
This organization was formed
with the knowledge and consent
of both Dean Boyer of St. Paul's

Cathedral and Bishop Kerr.
On the national level,
INTEGRITY’s purpose is to

integrate Christian lesbians and
gay men into the Christian body
as wholly accepted human
beings and children of God, and
to call on all Christians to
mutually support the eradication
of fear and misunderstanding
which increase existing divisions
among persons of differing gen-
der and sexuality and to work
for that love and trust which
heals and unifies.

INTEGRITY supports all
Christian homosexuals who ans-
wer calls to lay and ordained
ministries of faithful witness and
service to this portion of the
Body of Christ. We call upon all
Christians to support the corpor-
ate life and personal relation-
ships of all persons within the
Christian church and the world
which manifest a wholesome
example of commitment and
faithfulness.

We in INTEGRITY believe
in these things and are working
quietly, but firmly and resolute-
ly, toward these goals; all of us,
both lesbians and gay men. As a
Christian lesbian feminist, I can
honestly state that my experi-
ence as a member of the group
has been, and continues to be,
one of complete acceptance. The
group has been extremely help-
ful, supportive and encouraging
to me both personally and in my
struggle to reconcile my lesbian-
ism and my Christianity.
The atmosphere is always one of
loving acceptance, sharing and
mutual support.

In these coming days of
Right Wing Conservatism, groups
like INTEGRITY are going to
become even more important as
we struggle against the seemingly
overwhelming odds of the Moral
Majority. The persecution is
beginning already in San Fran-
cisco. Individuals are not going

to be able to effect changes, and
it’s my personal belief that
political groups are going to be
equally ineffective. We are going
to have to overcome our stereo-
typical images and show the
Moral Majority that we are not

all a group of perverted bed-
hoppers interested only in pass-
ing sexual encounters. And we
are going to have to do this on
their own turf — in church!

INTEGRITY is not the only

religious group for gays in this
country, but it is the only one in
Burlington. Some other groups
in larger cities with similar goals
include Brethren/Mennonite
Council for Gay Concerns
(Washington, D.C.); Bet Mish-
pachah/The Gay Synagogue of
Washington, D.C.; Dignity/Gay
Catholics (chapters in many
major cities); Gay and Lesbian
Quakers (Washington, D.C.);
Metropolitan Community
Church (Home Church in San
Francisco, chapters in major
cities). All of these groups are
generally based on the Golden
Rule, ‘Do unto others as you
would have them do unto you.”
I wonder sometimes if the Moral
Majority has not somehow for-
gotten that premise.

I’m sure there are sisters in
this community who could and
would derive great benefit and
comfort from a group like
INTEGRITY. I would like to
personally invite any Christian
woman out there who might be
interested to meet us, possibly
attend one of our meetings and
decide for herself. I will be
happy to accompany anyone
who is a bit shy about encoun-
tering an unknown quantity on
her own. I've been there and I
know how difficult that can be.
Anyone interested may contact
me at 862-4113 after 6 p.m.
You will be most welcome.

Winter

Erotica

By J. M. Freezing

They pressed their down
jackets together in a tight
embrace, Pam could almost feel
Cassie’s soft curving body
through the layers. Cassie could
almost feel Pam’s breath quicken
through the layers.

“Oh, the touch of your
mitten on my cheek... the sight
of your breath... but you're
fogging up my glasses.”

Mitten in mitten, they
walked to the house. They

undressed — within
and got into bed.

“Don't touch me ‘til your
hands are warm.”

“Come close to me.”

“I can’t move. The covers
are too heavy.”

“Come close to me, but
don’t take all the covers.”

“Oh, the feel of your socks
on my leg...”

“Oh, the scratch of your
long underwear against mine...”

Pam longed to hold Cassie
in her arms. Tentatively, gently,
she reached under Cassie’s sweater.
And under her turtleneck.
And under her T-shirt. Skin...
Their chapped lips met.
