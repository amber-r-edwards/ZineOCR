TIME WALK

The lamplight sparkles on your hair — Not  
the brown hairs,  

but those grey spiral springs,  

wiry, recalcitrant reminders of the future  
standing defiant  

against a majority of well-behaved brown.  

COMMONWOMAN MAY 1979  

Rimless glass and wired gold  

left over from our Hippy days  

encircle laughing lines  

around your eyes.  

You read,  

embraced by the maiden aunt armchair,  
brocaded matron, rescued from  

a 12th street trash heap, returning  

ten years of comfort for our pains.  

We grow older; softer  

breasts than before lie against  

the years and nights we’ve spent watching  
ourselves line a little,  

with laughter, tears, and some rage.  

Our lives and habits blend (not at all the same),  
but fitting.  

Fitting like my worn fountain pen  

slants in my hand.  

This joy of walking together into Time  
is one fruit of love  
I never expected.  

—M. Shaellow

The spokesperson added  
that the central demands of the  
march are to end all social,  
economic, and judicial discri-  

mination against Lesbians and  
Gay people. We hope to have a  
large representation of Maine,  
New Hampshire, and Vermont at  
the March.
