Fired by the success of the  
anti-rape march and deeply  
concerned by the current repres-  
sive political climate, Burlington  
women have been meeting with  
the intent of forming a coalition  
of feminists to be more political-  
ly effective.  

Individual members of the  
Black Lesbian Coalition, Com-  
monwoman, Everywoman’s  
Place, Furious Women Against  
Pornography, the Mayor’s Task  
Force on Women, Older Femin-  
ists, the Rape Crisis Center, the  
Vermont Women’s Health Cen-  
ter, Women Helping Battered  
Women, and the Women’s Party  
for Survival, and individual  
women not affiliated with a  
group have met three times in  
the last few weeks. The follow-  
ing is a first draft of a statement  
that we hope will be endorsed at  
an open women’s meeting to be  
held April 26:  

The gains women worked so  
hard to achieve in the 70's are  
being threatened in the 80's by a  
well-organized, well-funded “im-  
moral minority.” We recognize  
this as a direct attack on the  
gains made by women in the  
past decade.  

Rutland Battered Women’s Network  

In Rutland, second biggest  
city in Vermont, reeking of  
sexism and male dominance,  
corner pubs and violence,  
sprouts the Rutland County  
Battered Women’s Network.  
Twenty-five womyn strong, it is  
helping sisters beaten in their  
own homes get out and make it  
on their own. With teamwork  
and mutual support systems of  
crisis workers and advocates,  
battered womyn are coming out  
and changing their lives.  

Since last May, with mini-  
mal publicity, the network has  
handled over 230 calls. Sixty  
womyn were in safe homes and  
about forty womyn attended  
support groups held twice a  
week. Pat Maille, chairwomyn of  
RCBWN, holds weekly support  
groups at her home. Beaten for  
18 years, Pat spends all of her  
free time helping victims of  
men’s violence.  

“The only way we get  
through the tremendous pres-  
sures of a male-dominated  
society striving to keep us down  
is to band together and encour-  
age each other. We need to keep  
reminding ourselves we are  
whole complete beings with our  
own lives.” Pat asserts this by  
sticking by womyn in crisis  
throughout the legal processes  
and social service routines.  

Most battered womyn have  
been isolated for so long without  
being “allowed” by their batter-  
ers to make friends or communi-  
cate with the outside world.

LOCAL NEWS  

By the Women of the  
Coalition  

The current backlash in-  
creases the threat to the lives  
and health of all women. Aware  
of this escalation, Burlington  
women are joining together to  
form a coalition to intensify our  
determination to control our  
own lives and destinies. We are  
women with diverse back-  
grounds and politics, and we are  
all feminists. We have different  
tactics, but we respect and  
support the urgent need for  
direct action on all fronts.  
We recognize an attack on any  
woman as an attack on all  
women.  

Women fought for their  
rights in the 70’s because a  

growing sense of self did not  
allow silence about the woman-  
hating structure society is based  
on. Speaking to our own lives  
again, we quickly found that  
there were urgent priorities in  
protecting our own life and  
health. We found that in the  
twentieth century we still did  
not have reproductive freedom,  
freedom to choose our own  
sexuality, freedom from male  
violence and sexual assault,  
equality of pay or an equal voice  
in our government.

relationship requires a resociali-  
zation process wherein the  
womyn must practice feeling  
whole and able. The Rutland  
County Battered Women’s Net-  
work strives to provide enough  
ongoing support to womyn to  
help them regain their sense of  
self.  

In February, the network  
was given the use of the old  
county jail for six months.  
Network members have cleaned  
and painted the 16-room struc-  
ture, disposing of dead rats,  
scraping food and crud off walls,  
and patching up holes punched  
in the walls by angry men. When  
the Commissioner of Corrections  
learned of the conditions left, he  
sent a work crew of inmates to  
help with the renovations.  

The building looks beautiful  
now. It has been transformed  
from a prison for violent men to  
a home for victims of men's  
violence, by hours of hard work  
by womyn volunteers, rugs,  
paint and an anonymous dona-  
tion of $22,000 worth of new  
furniture. On March 15, RCBW  
held an open housewarming  
party at the shelter,  
named HerStory House, A Home  
For Battered Women. One hun-  
dred fifty people attended and  
saw a slide show prepared by  
Deane Brittingham on the pre-  
vious conditions of the building.  
The public was incredulous at  
the transformation that had  
taken place.  

RCBWN hoped to be hous-  
ing womyn by the end of March,

WOMEN’S COALITION  

Addressing these injustices  
first in consciousness-raising  
groups, women went on to  
establish health care centers,  
rape crisis centers, shelters for  
battered women, fought to make  
safe abortion available for those  
who choose it, taught self-  
defense, created daycare centers,  
fought for affirmative action,  
and generally created a better  
community in our efforts to gain  
control of our own lives.  

The coalition we are form-  
ing plans to be a political action  
group and a communication  
network. We will be concerned  
with reproductive freedom, free-  
dom of sexual preference, the  
Equal Rights Amendment, vio-  

lence against women in all its  
forms, and other issues of vital  
importance to women.  

Our next meeting will be  
held Sunday, April 26, at 7 p.m.,  
at Everywoman’s Place, 290  
Main Street (second floor), Bur-  
lington. If you need childcare,  
call 658-1489 and ask for Lynn.  
Area women’s groups and indivi-  
dual women are encouraged to  
come to the meeting...  

(There are fire regulations and  
insurance requirements to be  
met.) Battered womyn without  
children will be able to stay for  
four weeks. With children,  
womyn will be able to stay for  
six weeks. Planning to volunteer  
staff HerStory House around the  
clock, the network is proud of  
its new home, and looks forward  
to offering a place to battered  
womyn where they can stay and  
reorganize their lives in peace.

about it.  
The nuclear act is violent.  
It is an act of rape upon the  

atom, a penetration of its  
magnetic field, of the sacred  
space of its microcosmic solar  
system — a violation that sets off  
a diabolical billiards game of  
spinning radioactive particles —  
orphans from the nuclear family  
— seeking, in their rage, that  
most vulnerable of human flesh  
— the developing embryo.  

As women, as cradlers of  
these embryos, can we let this  
mayhem continue?  

Close your eyes and think  
about our government's prepara-  
tion for nuclear war.  

We seem unable to stop the  
momentum of it, of the con-

Park, April 5, in support of the  
sit-in at the Vernon Nuclear  
Power Plant:  
the continual build-up of megaton upon  
megaton of repressed hostility —  
stored underground, stored upon  
water... building up to an  
explosive rage...  

This Mother’s Day, May 10,  
energy is gathering here and  
from around the state to hold a  
peace rally and pageant here in  
Burlington. As a mother, I don’t  
care about the candy, I don’t  
care about the flowers. I just  
want to be able to envisage my  
child's future -- and all child-  
ren’s future — without fear and  
trembling.  

By Phyllis Sawyer  

My name is Phyllis Sawyer.  
I have to speak out today, my  
rage, not just against nuclear  
power and the threat of war, but  
also against the way they accel-  
erate all the violence in our  
lives... now. I am in fear and  
trembling now, fear and trem-  
bling for the children of Atlanta  
still alive and what they must be  
feeling; I am in fear, and trem-  
bling and rage for those children  
already brutally murdered in  
Atlanta.  

I am in fear and trembling  
for little boys in this society  
who want to grow up to be  
nurturing and loving when the  
society has assigned to them  
the role of murderers.  

I am in fear and trembling  
for little girls who want to grow  
up to be mothers and whose  
babies may be deformed by  
radiation; I am in fear and  
trembling for little girls who  
want to grow up to pursue  
excellence in whatever way they  
wish and the way everything is  
set against them.  

I had to speak my rage first,  
my rage and my tears, so I could  
send my love to the people at  
Vernon today.
