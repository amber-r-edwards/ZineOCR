Cassandra who learned the gift of
prophesy from Apollo and was later cursed
with disbelief visits walking around inside
me and in the dark corners of my mind a
constant reminder of what is and could be
but won't be believed that there exists and
is underway an underground underground
Lesbian movement that some of us know about
who have global imagination and some far
reaching knowledge that certain things must
and will happen no matter what delays or
disbeliefs pass in front and behind us
constantly taking disguise in metaphors
because it's too early and too dangerous to
say right out truths arise but are doubted
because growth is needed women need to get
from point A to point B in the movement in
order to survive in order to see control as
unnecessary in order to gain power because
nobody has any real power who is still
concerned about control which means globally
that we all eventually do what we want to do
and every struggle for control does nothing
but delay actions we need to move ahead when
we need to move ahead and we all know this
and have known it since our brains first
began to function as this is the only real
knowledge anyway and everything else we
learn only adds to it which reminds me that
when I was a little kid I knew all the time
that my mother would never stop me from
having/wearing all the blue jeans I ever
wanted and she could only delay it and I
would do it anyway so her struggle to control
was useless it was inevitable it would happen
all coming back full circle no straight person
can control us as dykes finally as we will
all be who we want except that we are impatient
and we want our revolution now so our statement
to rock all controls like time schedules 9-5
in a 5 day work-shit week or being prompt or
obeying idiotic laws like don't rip-off stores
and don't kiss and rub in public which is all
such a farce because when we want to do it we
will and Cassandra visits me like she has Susan
McElroy who first told me she was around and
in between who first sent her spirit to me last

glee. ego whose prophesies go unbelieved and
unheeded and who knows this curse and this
anger and who more than anything else wants
to be heard and will be and has been in a
small way by some of us who know Cassandra
but the desolation of it all is sometimes
unbearable which is to say in case you missed
it prophets are in our midst in this under-
ground underground movement so ears should be
awake and eyes should be searching and another
level of your mind opened so we can all see
something else other than what appears to be
the obvious and when you think you know what's
happening consider the opposite Consider the
Opposite if you think you've arrived at point
B go back to point A and start again all this

Cassandra

is unreal you know it's all a fantasy and my
reality may be my dreams and my dreams my real-
ity because Barb saw me sleep and said how
real it was with my hands moving and my breath-
ing like a coronary and my mouth about to speak
so do you know what I'm saying even though I'm
half crazy waiting for the movement to come
around again standing in the largest circle and
listening to all the sounds of the smaller
circles disturbing each other which doesn't
make much sense in the usual sense but that

is what this is all about like considering the
unreal world of the schizophrenic who sits
speaking truths in such an exaggerated way that
she's sent to an institution where it doesn't
make any difference who listens to her they're
all as crazy as she but when schizophrenics
unite the world will know and when they are
cured they will remember and that's why barely
anyone wants them cured Cassandra visits them
continually and some of us have known it all
the time and their fantasies will be ours

which will give us enough power to change
everything never mind how crazy idealistic
unrealistic it sounds we all do know what's
happening to each other and feel it all the
time there are no secrets so gossip doesn't
really matter as you know who falls in love
with you and who falls in love with me and

that it's important that some dykes stand

in the center of the circle espousing truths

to everyone else because all the others want

it need it search for it which is really
waiting for wonder woman to fly us all out

of the jungle of despair so don't look for
answers there are none no whys that explain

it because it's all a feeling anyway all else

is unreal only death is real and that's not
final because we come back again all the

time one way or another. So get yourself over to point B which
is global imagination and gestalt-like

seeing minor details that which appears to

be irrelevant but nothing is ever irrelevant
and some may say this is nothing but an ego
trip which it might be in some distorted way
but the opposite is really the case listen

to the dyke in the sea the Lesbian who is the
wall the barrier that prevents the flooding

the dyke in the sea of straight oppression the
dyke who is wonder woman who will save us so

we will save the world after all what matters
is not that this dyke is concerned about the
center of attention but the center of the
movement which is underground underground and
concerned about the point of the largest circle
and who has gone around it is dyke standing in
the crester circle listening to Cassandra and
wondering so in the midst of everything else
Lesbians unite and listen to the dyke in the
sea.

grass from the front

happy anniversary to us! a year ago the amazon nation
was a mere fantasy in two of our collective heads now
we have expanded to include many more vital dykes and
huzzah! our nine room house is also celebrating our
oct. move to 80 fertile oklahoma acres this year past
we at the Nation have lived and learned and struggled
together despite negative criticism from local sisters
no one would print our thoughts so we have begun print-
ing them ourselves and still growing the lesbian na-
tion is fast becoming reality we're starting our own
culture community in case you missed Betty's announ-
cement of all this months ago in lavender woman try
reading my new book porcupines and valentines it has
all the answers and questions it's not enough to just
want to go, and yes, the 6 or 8 of us are really off
to see the wizard..c.sccccsercsccocseslightfoot.
