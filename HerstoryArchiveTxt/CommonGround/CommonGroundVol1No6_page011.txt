Daphne’s  
Tree  

by Sarah Slavin  

February is symbolically the month  
for relationships because St. Valen-  
tine's Day falls on February 14. Con-  
temporary relationships are frequent—  
ly expressive in ways other than ro-  
mantic. But, Valentine's Day doesn't  
seem to go out of style—and neither,  
fortunately, does love.  

Herbs have figured in love potions.  
If a loved one doesn't return the  
favor, well, perhaps the chemistry of  
the situation can be altered by an  
aphrodisiac. Or, so the reasoning of  
the lovelorn has sometimes gone.  

The curious thing (to me) about  
aphrodisiacs is the part they seem to  
play most regularly: awakening the  
desire of men. Why men need their de-  
sire awakened is unclear. But if they  
do, they do. So, let's give it a try.  

One recipe for an aphrodisiac  
(not guaranteed by the Good Housekeep-  
ing seal of approval) was presented  
by Cheik Umar Ibn Muhammed, Al-Jef-  
zaoui (ca. 1394). I am indebted to  
Mitzie Stuart Keller, Mysterious Herbs  
and Roots (Peace Press, 1978), p. 17,  
for reprinting this recipe. The  
recipe goes as follows: "He who boils  
Halioun (asparagus) and then fries  
them in fat, and then pours upon them  
the yolks of eggs with pounded con-  
diments (such as Ginger, Garlic, On-  
ions, and pepper) and eats every day  
of this dish, will grow very strong  
for the coitus and find a stimulus  

- for amorous desires." (!) The recipe  
was intended, I understand, to assist  
sheiks with the demands, made by rel-  
atives of those in the sheiks‘ harams,  
that the sheiks perform.  

And, asparagus may well be the ul-  
timate phallic symbol (although I be-  
lieve the Washington Monument must be  
given its just due.) Asparagus is  
impregnated (sic) with vitamin E, to  
which is attributed a lot of sexual  
power. So far, so good. Cook the  
asparagus al dente, not to lose the  
vitamin E. But, dear me, look here.  
‘Twas said in maybe 1525, by one  
Richard Bankes: “The virtue of As-  
paragus is thus. It maketh a man to  
piss very mightily." That will

it can't be all that bad.  

never do. In convenient if not untidy.  

Perhaps the rest of the recipe off-  
sets this little problem. Let's see.  
Ginger. Uh-huh. "Green Ginger is  
provoking to venerie and lust" (John  
Gerarde, Master in Chirurgery). Oops—  
ginger is supposed to excite women.  
It does have a pleasantly aromatic  
taste, though. It's a stimulant too.  
But chock full of volatile oil, resin  
and asarin (very bitter). And unfor-  
tunately, it's a diuretic. We cer-  
tainly don't need any more of that.  
Best move on.  

Ah, garlic—nice looking plant,  
once used as an offering to Hecate.  
It does  
have a bit of a reputation, the smell.  
But here—chewed by a male runner or  
jockey, none will surpass him in the  
race. More volatile oil, however,  
plus a radical sulphide. Strong stuff.  
Perhaps the ginger will overcome it.  

Onions? Dear, dear. The less said  
the better.  
Egg yolks? Too much cholesterol.  

Not to mention the asparagus are fried  
in fat.  

Pepper? Piperine. Volatile oil.  
And Chavicin, more resin. Furthermore,  
coming from a plant with hermaphrodite  
flowers, VERY pungent...  

The poor man. Can this be the thing  
to do? Definitely not. St. Valentine  
was a martyred Roman priest (and  
either uncanonized or decanonized be-  
cause he was too pagan). Enough is  
enough. If the man sought after with  
this aphrodisiac of ours is an Aquarian  
(January 21 - February 19), he isn't  
going to be too relaxed to begin with.  
And by disposition, he won't be in-  
clined to propose as is. Excepting  
Clark Gable, famous Aquarian men such  
as Jack Benny, Charles Darwin and  
Norman Rockwell are not exactly sex  
symbols. How could I forget—Aquarius  
is the water bearer! Can this be love?  

Tsk.
