This month heralds both the  
new year and the inauguration of  
Ronald Reagan for a second term  
as President. For those of you  
who have recovered from the post-  
election doldrums, I'd like to  
suggest to you some ways to cope  
with the next four years.

It is clear we cannot merely  
sit around and bemoan the state  
of our nation, watching the news  
every evening. We must act, in  
whatever capacity our lifestyles,  
interests, finances and schedules  
permit.

For as long as I have been an  
inveterate reader of obituary  
columns, I have often noticed  
people referred to as "activists."  
These individuals usually devoted  
years of their lives to community  
service, as volunteers, board  
members, or participants in  
community organizations. Many of  
them had the comfortable lives and  
ample amounts of time and money  
necessary to be able to act.  

It never seemed to describe  
my life.

By the late 60's, the term  
“activist" became synonymous with  
“protester." Activists seemed  
to be able to drop everything to  
participate in an all-night sit-  
in or to join a bus excursion for  

a march on Washington. But again,  
this rarely was a reality in my  
life as a poor but diligent stu-  
dent.

Yet in the past few years, I  
have found that in my own small  
way, and often without even leav-  
ing home, I do many things to  
voice my opinion and to feel like  
I have a hand in effecting changes.  
Since I have neither large amounts  
of money or very much alone time  
outside the house to donate, I  
guess I think of myself as a mod-  
ified activist. When I read the  
paper and watch the news, rarely  
a day goes by that I don't ask  
myself, "What can I do about that?”  
At the very least, the answer is  
that I can take a stand.

So below I offer a list of  
activist work almost anyone can  
do. Most require minimal time  
and little or no money, and are  
quite easy to do. They might  
suggest other ideas to you as well.  
Perhaps one of your New Year's  
Resolutions can be to become  
more involved in issues that con-  
cern you or affect your own life.  
By doing so, you'll also develop  
good survival skills for the  
next four years.

ACTIVISM NOW

you heard this, but how often do  
you actually do this? Have you  
ever seen one of those news reports  
showing bundles of mail bags all  
over the floor of a Senator's of-  
fice? Could you say that your  
letter was among them? (Most ad-  
dresses and telephone numbers you  
would need are in the telephone  
book.)

Everyone you elect, from U.S.  
Senator on down to Buffalo Common  
Council members is supposed to  
represent their electorate. What  
better way is there for them to  
know the views of that electorate  
than from our letters or phone  
calls? Next time you're in the  
Post Office, buy a supply of plain,  
white 13¢ postcards to keep on  
hand. It takes but a few minutes  
to compose a sentence or two and  
address the card. You'll feel  
like you've not only taken a stand  
but acted on it.

MAILING LISTS

Get on mailing lists or ask  
for the newsletters of organiza-  
tions whose work you support. It  
is an excellent way to find out  
what legislation is pending, and  
how you can support or oppose it.

The address below will put you  
in touch with a variety of femin-  
ist events, actions, publications  
and services: National Women's  
Mailing List, 1195 Ballencia,  

San Francisco, CA 94129 (a suggest-  
ed donation is $3.50).

Write longer letters of opinion,  
either to individual people or  
businesses, or to "Letters to the  
Editor" columns of newspapers.

For the former, the audience may  
be small, but the impact can be  
substantial. For example, I re-  
cently received a Christmas adver-  
tisement brochure in the mail from  
Fay's Drugstores. It delineated  
children's toys in quite a sexist  
manner, both in their categories  
on separate pages, and in the  
headlines that introduced each  
page. Because it was mailed di-  
rectly to our house (as opposed  

to the inserts in the newspaper  
which we subscribe to), I wrote  
them a letter pointing out that  
sexism was offensive to me and  
that it did not reflect the real-  
ity of all children's play. When  
I write such letters, I end by  
stating I will no longer do busi-  
ness there until I see a change.  
(And in this case, I also asked  

to be taken off their mailing  
list.) Hit them where it hurts  
--in the pocketbook. (Incident-  
ally, I almost always get replies;  
albeit brief and sometimes non-  
committal ones.)

Any letters printed in a news-  
paper are going to have a vast  
audience. There is a certain sa-  
tisfaction in seeing your name  
in print, too. Even as a non-sub-  
scriber or an “outsider,” you can  
submit a letter. For example, in  
late November, I had occasion to  
be at E.C.C. City Campus, where I  
picked up a copy of their student  
paper, entitled Downtown Student  
Press. In it was an incredible  
account, by columnist Clint East-  
land, describing a pastime of  

him and his friends, that is,  
perusing the "lifestyles" section  
of The Buffalo News each Sunday  
in search of the Ugly Bride of  
Buffalo for the Year. I was too  
outraged to just toss the paper  
aside, so I wrote a letter to the  
editor, even though I am neither  
a student or teacher at E.C.C.  
Perhaps you will join me in doing  
the same.

LETTER WRITING CAMPAIGNS  
Organizations ask for people  
to come together to write letters.  
Not only is it more enjoyable to  

write in a social setting, but  
this activity puts you in touch  
with others whose views are akin  
to yours.

OTHER ACTIVITIES

Go to local events that you  
support. There's strength and im-  
pact in numbers, so your presence  
always counts.

In the few years I have been  
home during the day, I have lent  
my physical support to such things  
as a National Fuel Gas protest  
rally in Niagara Square and an  
International Women's Pay March  
(and these are even good outings  
for my little ones.) If you have  
strong feelings, you can clap,  
boo, or even wear buttons or  
carry a sign. (Who knows, you  
might even be interviewed by the  
media, too.) This past October,  
Barbara Bush, the wife of our  
VP, appeared at the inaugural  
ceremony for Buffalo's Light  
Rail Rapid Transit just one day  
after making her now-infamous  
disparaging remark (rhymes with  
rich) about Geraldine Ferraro.  
Although I attended the ceremony  
because I've always loved down-  
town Buffalo and I'm happy to  
support its revitalization, I  
summoned up all my courage and  
"booed" her when she was intro-  
duced. Despite all the turned  
heads (including my one-year-old's)  
I felt that this was the only way  
I could voice my disapproval of  
her presence in Buffalo.

Talk to others about your re-  
actions to and opinions of events  
in the news. Often such conversa-  
tions with relatives, friends and  
even co-workers can spur them on  
to some action, too. Motivating  
others is certainly a form of  
activist work.

One final note: as women,  
such activism as letter writing  
may not come easily. After all,  
we were all socialized and in-  
structed, both at home and in  
school, to write polite and ver-  
bose thank-you notes, or even  
letters of complaint about a  
defective product. But few of us  
were encouraged or taught how to  
write letters on subjects any  
more serious, more socially active  
or political. So remember to be  
strong and confident in your views,  
and be assertive when expressing  
them, while writing tactfully  
and formally. These techniques  
produce the best result for me.

activism and more things to do  
to be involved.
