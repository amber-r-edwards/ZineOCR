reviewed by Batya Weinbaum  

NO CHARGE FOR LOOKING (Schocken,  
N.Y. 1984) is an interesting  
spicy book by a young woman  
novelist, Esther Cohen, whose  

28-year-old main character,  
Melanie, goes to Nazareth on an  
assignment from a left-wing New  
York newspaper to write about  
the Arabs in Israel. During the  
course of the book, Melanie's  
clothes become increasingly  
feminine; she is courted and  
pursued by one Arab male; and  
one third-world (Indian) Jew;  
she writes long letters home to  
her editor about how she is  
falling in love and getting con-  
fused; and in the end she dis-  
cards practically all her posses-  
sions save only her white Nile  
perfume and goes off on a bus  

in search of anonymity and a  
place that feels like home.  

Many interesting characters  
are portrayed: The Long Island  
Jew Shari who marries an Arab  
novelist; a radical lesbian  
living on a kibbutz; a Mother  
Superior in Nazareth who takes  
pity on the American journalist  
"Hebrew" woman or Jew; the Cleo  
of many costumes. Cohen juxta-  
poses lifestyles well, and doing  
so addresses directly the accul-  
turated Jewish woman's search  
for roots in a war-ridden society.  
We follow the modern liberated  
woman's response to traditional  
roles of family and femininity.  
With each passing colorful  
scene we get a deeper view into  
her desire for acceptance.  

The character's disappointment  
over the technocracy of  
Israel and her impulse to be-  
come random and free, is epito-  
mized by dancing on a beach in  
a Sephardic wedding party. Her  
interest in gold hoop earrings,  
and the right table manners over  
double espresso, and the like,  
grows, and we follow a series  
of letters home about how she  
cannot write her story. The  
whole time, the peopled web of  
her experience tells all.  

It is a treat to read a novel  
in which early radical feminist  
classics are mentioned, yet one  
wonders, if she is a feminist,  
why she accepts inferior sex with  
men. Be that as it may, the  
idea of writing of the politics  
of the Mideast via the sexual  
politics as a woman struggles  
with lovers and affairs makes  
the statement "The personal is  
political"; and that she never  
writes her factual journalistic  
story, despite the harangues of  
the male editor at home—who  
cares.  

One must congratulate the  
author and the publisher for  
publishing this book. A career  
woman-writer roaming foreign  
countries sleeping with the  
locals is one step, despite its  
problems, over Lawrence Durrell.  

WOMEN SPEAK OUT  

by Sharon Green  

Did you know that in New  
York State there is a Women's  
Division? Established by  
Governor Mario Cuomo, its function  
is to address the needs and con-  
cerns of women and to develop  

policies and programs to im-  

prove the quality of women's  
lives. Furthermore, the N.Y.S.  

Women's Division can propose  

new legislation to the governor,  
as well as support the 24 women  
legislators in the New York  
State Senate.  

On Saturday, October 26, the  

Women's Division co-sponsored  

a public forum entitled "Women  
Speak Out" at Erie Community  
College City Campus. Other  
sponsors of this event were  

the YWCA of Buffalo and Erie  
County and the Women's Studies  
Interdisciplinary Unit and the  
Affirmative Action/Human Devel-  
opment Office, both of Buffalo  
State College.  

The purpose of the dialogue  
was twofold: First, for area  
women to learn more about the  
work of the Women's Division,  
and second, for their represen-  
tatives to listen to questions  
and concerns from the audience.  
These representatives were  
Polly Spedding, the executive  
director of the Governor's Com-  
mission on Child Care; Adrienne  
Kivelson, the Associate Director  
of the Division for Women; Char-  
lotte Jefferson, Program Associate  
of the Division for Women; and  
Judith Avner, Assistant Direc-  
tor of the Division for Women.  

Despite the lure of free  
lunch and free childcare, not  
to mention an opportunity to  
express opinions and ideas  
directly to state representa-  
tives, attendance was disap-  
pointing. Nonetheless, much  
information was imparted, and  
lots of ideas and knowledge  
shared.  

Some of the issues that  
were emphasized by the speakers,  
and that are primary concerns  
of the N.Y.S. Women's Division  
are:  
POVERTY OF WOMEN: In New York  
State today, there are 800,000  
female-headed families with  
children, and 51% of these are  

below the poverty level. The  
average yearly income of minority  

women in New York who head house-  
holds and have children is an  
abysmal $7,600/year.  

TEENAGE PREGNANCY: In 1982,  

in New York State, 65,000 single  
girls, between the ages of 10  
and 19 became pregnant. Out of  
these, 28,000 carried their  
babies to term. When children  
give birth to children, the  
cycle of poverty increases.  
Teen pregnancy is rising faster  
in the U.S. than in any other  
country in the industrialized  
world. And contrary to popular  
myth, this is not just a Black  
problem. Last year, Gov. Cuomo  
organized a task force on teen  
pregnancy.  

JOB TRAINING: Fewer than 15%  
of this nation's families are  
"traditional" nuclear families,  
with father in the paid work-  
force, and mother at home caring  
for the children. Few women  
today have the luxury to be  
able to be home all day. Yet  
job training programs are often  
useless to women because there  
are no provisions for child  
care. This especially hurts  
teen women, often the ones  

who could most benefit from job  
training.  

CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM: Many  
women in prison have left child-  
ren behind, or have babies  

when incarcerated. And their  
problems, as well as the crimes  
that put them there in the first  
place, are quite different from  
those of male prisoners. The  
N.Y.S. Women's Division is  
working to address the special  
needs of women prisoners.  

CHILDCARE: Gov. Cuomo estab-  
lished a Commission on Child-  
care in 1984, to address the  
crisis in childcare in New  

York State. 830,000 children  
(infants to age 13) now need  
childcare for some part of the  
day. Existing childcare work-  
ers are often grossly underpaid.  
Establishing more childcare is  
an economic issue. (Local note:  
As we go to press, The Children's  
Place, a new on-site day care  
center located in the Rath  
Building Downtown, is about to  
open its doors to a limited  
amount of children of county  
employees.)  

Buffalo Childbirth Coalition  

Resource Center Moved  

Did you know that the Buffalo Childbirth  
Coalition has a Resource Center? It is a well  
kept secret. Articles and books about child-  
bearing issues have been piling up and are  
available, free, to anyone interested in  
reading them.  

The BCC has relocated its growing collec-  
tion in the Esther Sawyer Memorial Library  
in Planned Parenthood of Buffalo located at  
210 Franklin Street, Buffalo, NY 14202.  

Librarian Barbara Salit-Michel has courage-  
ously offered to integrate the BCC files with  
the Esther Sawyer collection to make them  
accessible to the community. Anyone is  
welcome to use these resources in the library,  
during regular hours Monday - Thursday,  
9-5 and some evenings by special arrange-  
ment. Call Barbara at 853-1771 for informa-  
tion. Donations to the collection will also be  
gratefully accepted.
