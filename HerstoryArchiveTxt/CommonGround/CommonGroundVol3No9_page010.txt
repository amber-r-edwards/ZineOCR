The Women’s Movement in Buffalo: Dead or Alive? Part I

by Ruth Geller

(The following is the text of

Ms. Geller's remarks presented at
the 1985 International Women's
Day Celebration panel discussion
on March 9, "The Women's Movement
in Buffalo: Dead or Alive?"

Ms. Geller represented Women's
Action for Nuclear Disarmament -
WAND. Our thanks to her for
permission to share her remarks
with our readers.)

For the past few weeks, ever since
I knew I'd be on this panel, I've
been trying to figure out what I
wanted to say, what I felt it was im-
portant for me to say. I figured out
bits and pieces, jotted down a sentence
here and a sentence there, but the
whole thing lacked something to hold
it together.

Then one day I was walking home
from the grocery store, and I saw up
ahead a woman who looked familiar. I
wasn't sure it was her until I saw
the bumper stickers on her car.
"Hello!" I called. "I was wondering
about your bumper stickers," and she laughed, because

her bumper stickers had said: "Women’s
Vote for Peace," and "Mondale/Ferraro."
I stopped to chat; and in the
course of conversation I mentioned
that I was going to be on this panel
but that I hadn't quite figured out what
to say. Did she have any suggestions?
She looked surprised that I'd asked,
and reassured me that I'd be fine. I
agreed -- I probably would be all right,
but I wasn't looking for reassurance;
I was looking for ideas. Did she have
any suggestions about what I should
talk about? What would she talk about?
Oh, she said, she'd talk about the
usual things, women and peace.
How peace is important to women, how
our lives are affected by the military
budget, by the fear of nuclear war.

Why it's important that we should all
be involved in one way or another.

I nodded. "Oh," I said, "that
sounds good. I was going to talk about
WAND -- you know, to try and plug it."

"No," she said, shaking her head.
"WAND doesn't need any plugs. Talk
about the issues."

For me, the issue is nuclear dis-
armament.

For me, the issue is the fact that
the arms industry is the number one
growth industry in the world today.

If you want to make money, invest in
war. The money required to provide
adequate food, water, education,
health care and housing for everyone
in the world has been estimated at
17 billion dollars a year -- about as
much as the world spends on arms every
two weeks.

I have seen films of Hiroshima,
Japan after the American government
ordered the atomic bomb to be dropped
on that city; I have seen the miles
of rubble where there once was life.

This is the vision that drives me.
The American government has for
years been designing and building
more and more sophisticated weapons
-- and using our money to do so --
that make the bombs dropped on
Hiroshima look like children's toys.
And these weapons form a vision in
my mind, a vision that drives me --
a vision of the earth as a poisoned,
lifeless ball, the end of billions of
lives, the end of life

on earth.
Other women are driven by other
visions -- the vision of a woman raped
and battered; the vision of people
exploited and enslaved so that someone
else can make money; the vision of
the earth being poisoned by corporations
motivated by greed, and greed alone.

I have no interest in debating whose
issue is more "important," more “cru-
cial," because it is beside the point.

The point is -- and it's very clear
to me -- that whatever issues we
work on, wherever we direct our ener-
gies, our energies must, in fact, be
directed. Our energies must exist.

Because along with the horrible
vision of destruction that I carry
around with me is another vision: a
vision of women working together to
build a new world. A vision of
women understanding the incredible
power we have if only we stand up for
what we believe in, and learn to use
our wonderful and varied voices to
speak out against the terrible in-
justices in this world.

It is not easy, in a world as
violent as ours, having a vision of
peace, of women working together,
but it's a vision to which I must
cling, fragile and tenuous though
it may be.

There are many things that divide
us. Sometimes we're divided by the
issues themselves, by the urgency of
the work that must be done, and we
end up bickering over whose issues
are more important, more crucial.
Sometimes we are divided by the
differences between us as women --
differences of race, class, religion,
ethnicity, sexual orientation, and
all the other things that make us who
we are.

But I have seen that the differen-
ces between us as women need not
divide us, but rather can be sources
of learning about one another, and
understanding one another's per-
ceptions. And the factors that have
helped me personally to understand
this are that I am a Jew and a
lesbian who belongs to a political
organization made up primarily of
women who are Gentile and hetero-
sexual.

I have learned that not all Gen-
tiles are anti-Semitic; and when
they are, their anti-Semitism often
comes from ignorance, an ignorance
they've been taught. And not all
heterosexuals are condemning; and to
approach a heterosexual woman, a
Gentile woman, assuming she will be
condemnatory of my differences is to
set up a situation that will invite
misunderstanding.

I have learned that everyone makes
mistakes of one kind or another that
come out of ignorance; and that when
we're afraid of making mistakes it's
because we sense that whatever we
say will be heard with a suspicious
ear and viewed with a suspicious eye.
Our mistakes become compounded.

I have learned that while I must
correct those mistakes and mispercep-
tions of other women, I must do so
with tolerance, because their mis-
takes are often the result of the
misinformation society has given them,
just as mine are the result of the
misinformation society has given me.
It is, I believe, this tolerance of
one another's ignorances that can
reach across our differences and
create the bridges that will teach us
about one another, help us see through
one another's eyes, fortify our
strength, and help us to become a real
and powerful force for the peace and
justice this world so desperately
needs.

It is essential that our mistakes
not become bogged down in bickering
and back-biting, in tearing one another
down, but a dialogue that enables us
all to look within ourselves, and
understand our fears, our suspicions,
and our goals. Because it is the goals
we must focus on, the goals we must
remember.

Last year I sat in the audience of
the 1984 International Women's Day
Panel, and said, "I want a strong wo-
men's movement in Western New York.
I want us to be able to learn from
one another, and support one another
in our struggles." But after I said
it, I got the feeling that no one
heard me. And so today, up here with
a microphone, I'll say it again: "I
