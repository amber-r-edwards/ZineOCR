EMMA IS...

EMMA is...a collective venture...
an assertion of options to the patri-
archal market...a quiet, safe space
shared resources... Among the books
and resources we carry are many as-
sertively addressing specific aspects
of women's self-protection. These
defy any ready classification. Some
of them address the atrocity of vio-
lence against women. More, they
seek to overcome it. More, they hold
great promise of doing so.

Ginny NiCarthy's Getting
Handbook for Women in Abusive
Relationships, and Voices in the Night: Wo-
men Speaking About Incest, ed. Toni
McNaron and Yarrow Morgan, draw ex-
tensively on the voices of women who
have been abused. The title of
Terry Wolverton's chapter in the
McNaron/Morgan volume offers much:

In Silence Secrets Turn To Lies/
Secrets Shared Become Sacred Truth.
For those of us who have been there
and come back, such words are them-
selves action. Too many of us have
been there and not been able to re-
turn. No longer need this tragedy
continue. For our own sakes, it
must not.

Working on Wife Abuse, 6th ed., by
Betsy Warrior, provides a partial
listing of shelters and services
in the U.S. and abroad, along with
publications and films, some funding
information, and a sample budget
sheet, phone log, medical form and
welcome procedure [for setting up
a shelter]. Fighting Sexual Haras-
sment, by the Alliance Against
Sexual Coercion, is similarly pract-
ical. Cara Peter’s and Erin Van

JUNE 1983

By Korene Mardini

{Editor's note: this new column is
presented as a "little something
extra" that is fun and informative
for our readership. Tell us what
you think!]

ARIES (Mar. 21 thru Apr. 20) - Without
your feminine pioneering spirit, ad-
venturing into new areas of communi-
cating and spirituality, our lives
would lack richness. Use these ener-
gies now, because quests -- either
locally or at a distance--take on new
meaning at this time. Watch details
and aggressiveness on the 11th.

TAURUS (Apr. 21 thru May 21) - Asser-
tiveness may not be one of your strong
points, but persistence is. This
month you can see that a more opulent
lifestyle is possible as financial
matters get fueled. After the 6th
you may want to make creative changes
in your private living area.

GEMINI (May 22 thru June 21)- Turn
the energies back to you this month.

It's time to positively state your
needs, especially to that significant
‘other'. Diplomacy is called for, as
the powerful eclipse on the 11th can
support your personal goals for some
time to come. Spruce up your image
and make your statement.

CANCER (June 22 thru July 23)- Some-
times people accuse you of pulling
into your shell; this is to lessen
vulnerability. This month's energies
require inner recharging--get time
alone. Health and work areas come
to attention. Watch the Full Moon on
the 25th -~ put less emotion and more
feeling into words with your partner.

Keep Your Sanity (small matter!) .
Edith Fein provides a guide to
self-protection, personal safety
and rape prevention in her Are You
A Target? She is blunt and realis-
tic. The photographs are very help-
ful. She states:
"The argument in favor of women learning
self-defense is that rape is,
in essence, a crime in which most
assailants are not brought to justice"
(p. 125). Bruce Tegner's, Self
Defense: A Basic Course stresses
self-confidence and feelings of
competence. All the pictures in
the book are of men. The book is
short, to the point and very re-
vealing. Self Defense for Your Child
by Tegner and Alice McGrath is
intended to assist the adult teaching
girls and boys of elementary school
age. The book is flawed but defin-
itely has its points.

Astrological
Horoscope

LEO (July 24 thru Aug. 23) - You
always love to shine and this month
the Sun, your ruler, gives ample op-
portunity. Creative goals, dreams,
friendships and social gatherings are
highlighted, also romance. The 19th
calls for guarding against deception
--yours or others--innately honest,
these attributes need recalling.

VIRGO (Aug. 24 thru Sept. 23) - Dis-
criminating women in business or with
an eye toward advancement; this is
your month to reap some results.

You can diversify your talents now
and especially after the eclipse on
the 11th. Someone in your personal
environment may have insightful sug-
gestions--challenges are all around.

LIBRA (Sept. 24 thru Oct. 23) - Things
flow better this month, especially
when your ruler, Venus, moves into
Leo --after the 6th. Philosophical
and intellectual interests get im-
petus. You may be bound for distant
horizons or only dreaming about them.
Innovations in your mental approach
and stimulating concepts have
charged energy. Your special brand
of diplomacy is required on the 25th.

SCORPIO (Oct. 24 thru Nov. 22) -

That secretive feminine nature --
either an asset or a liability--gets
added fuel this month. Use your ex-
cellent financial insight to shake
loose funding or debts owed by others.

EMMA members have been surveying
the periodicals stock and have made
a number of changes there. “We hope
this is to help women. In
addition to carrying a
sampling of newsjournals from
across the country that are of in-
terest to women, there are feminist
literary journals such as Conditions
and Fireweed.

Be aware of smoldering possessiveness
in relationships and remember that
sexual gratification must have deeper
significance for you. Don't be duped
by slick words on the 19th.

SAGITTARIUS (Nov. 23 thru Dec. 21) -
Risk taking and unconventional be-
havior seems easier these days--it's
time to feel more alive than ever.
Watch that overconfidence is coupled
with some realistic values. This
may be the month you enter into a
significant partnership or finally
decide marriage isn't something to
be shunned any longer. Could it be
freedom with responsibility?

CAPRICORN (Dec. 22 thru Jan. 20) -

In June, adjustments are required all
around, with special emphasis in
health and work areas. At times you
feel like your own and other's
problems are always left on your
shoulders. The Full Moon on the 25th
brings awareness of close relation-
ship potentials which can be finally
worked through.

AQUARIUS (Jan. 21 thru Feb. 19) - Not

such a bad month to vacation or allow
your creative juices to flow. Small
and large groups, one of your favorite
areas of endeavor, get recharged--as
long as social needs are honored.
Romantic opportunities are everywhere,
especially after the 11th.

PISCES (Feb. 20 thru Mar. 20)- Your
favorite retreat gets attention this
month. There will be challenges, however,
between home, career and social
obligations. Long term
affairs can come to an end--residen-
tial changes can be made. Be certain
you are being realistic about decisions
made on the 19th.

RIGHTS OF CRIME VICTIMS
By Betty Cox

"Justice is a machine that, when
someone has given it a starting push,
rolls on of itself"

-Galsworthy, Justice, II

In the June 1982 brochure entitled
"Are You an Innocent Victim of a
Violent Crime?", former New York State
Governor Hugh L. Carey states: "At
long last, the innocent victim of a
violent crime is now recognized as
the unwilling but essential participant
in the Criminal Justice System in our
state. Your state government is con-
cerned about helping those innocent
victims of violent crime which society
has failed to protect and who have
suffered serious financial hardship
as a result of the crime. The Crime
Victims Board investigates and de-
termines claims of persons and their
dependents who are injured, disabled
or killed as a result of a criminal
act."

The Crime Victims Board is com-
posed of a chairman and four members,
three of whom are attorneys. They
are assisted by investigators and a
permanent staff.

The purpose of the NYS Board is to
provide financial reimbursement for
lost wages, out-of-pocket medical
and other related expenses to victims
of a violent crime. The maximum
amount of compensation for loss of
earnings and/or loss of support is
$20,000.

ELIGIBILITY FOR COMPENSATION

To file a claim, the criteria for
eligibility include:

1. You are the victim of a crime
who has sustained personal injuries
~or=

2. You are the surviving spouse,
parent or child, if the victim dies
as a direct result of the crime.
Other family members may only file
for reimbursement of burial expenses.
~or-
3. You are a dependent for
principal support upon such victim.
4. A police report must be made
to the proper authorities within one
week after the crime unless the
Board finds the delay in reporting to
have been justified for good cause.
5. The claim must be filed within
one year after the crime. Upon show-
ing good cause, the Board may grant
an extension of another year.
6. The claimant must prove serious
financial hardship as a direct
result of the crime. Sex offense
victims, however, are not required to
show financial hardship to receive
an award for a medical examination
in connection with the investigation
or prosecution of any such offense.

The one-page form is simple to
fill out. Additional information
concerning the Board's program and
benefits is available at every Board
office, police station, hospital
and other appropriate crime reporting
locations.

See the Women's Resource Directory
w/in the back of this paper for
important information, addresses
and services to victims of violent
crimes.

Betty Cox recently returned to Buffalo
from Schenectady, N.Y. and is a mem-
ber of the International Women's
Writers Guild.
