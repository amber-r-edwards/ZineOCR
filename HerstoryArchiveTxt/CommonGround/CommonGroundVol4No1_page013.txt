WE NEED YOU!!! CG is here as access  
to the community for ideas, analysis,  
communication... and more. If you are  
waiting for an in-depth analysis of  
your favorite cause, latest book you  
read, or a social phenomenon, you  
might have to wait a long time—  
because we are here to give you access  
to others, not necessarily to write  
all the articles, cover all the  
events, review all the books. We are  
a very small group of people, and we  
desperately need your help. Report  
news stories, review concerts, events,  
books and records, research issues,  
write your own opinions down on paper  
and tell us what we've missed. We  
would be happy to give you access to  
others in the pages of Common Ground.  
We are looking for variety—in styles,  
content, topic and approach. We  

know you have lots to say, so why  

not say it here in CG? Write c/o  

the paper for a style sheet—send  
stamped self-addressed envelope,  
please.
