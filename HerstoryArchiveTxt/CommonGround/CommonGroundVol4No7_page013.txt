Pro-Abortion,

from the earlier embryo." An embryo
is "the prefetal product of con-
ception up to the beginning of the
third month of pregnancy."

Does it matter what we call it?
The difference is emotional. A
seven-week embryo is not viable,
but calling it a fetus--since some
fetuses are viable--makes it sound
tantamount to an infant. Why have
we meekly accepted the anti-abortion

definition? Are we timid? Or are
we not sure we're right?

I do not suggest we adopt right-
wing tactics--for instance, by
renaming the fetus an embryo. But
I do insist that we need to recover
our certainty. Our pride. Abortion
is a good thing. I don't say that
we should abandon contraception:
for routine birth control, abortion
is unsatisfactory, mainly because
of the stress on the woman. But
safe, affordable, legal abortion
must continue to be available to
all women in this country. Without
it, we are not free.

And I fear that by failing in
conviction, we imperil that freedom.

That isn't to say that abortion
is a simple issue, or that women
who have abortions shouldn't feel
ambivalent. In some women, post-
abortion relief will always be
tempered with regret, guilt, grief,
and pain. If nothing else, there's
the knowledge that if things had
been different, the expelled embryo
or fetus might have become a loved
human being.

Like many feminists, I am dis-
turbed by selective abortion. The
abortion, after amniocentesis, of
a fetus with Down syndrome, spina
bifida, or certain other conditions
raises serious questions about
the rights of the disabled community
--and the effect on the collective
morality of society. If a disabled
fetus is listed, along with rape,
incest, extreme youth of the woman,

and a threat to the woman's life,
as an “extreme circumstance" then

International Women's Day is being
celebrated in Buffalo by a coali-
tion of women's groups and organ-
izations. We invite you to par-
ticipate in each event as we cele-
brate the contribution of Western
New York women to the world and
explore where we go from here.

Following is a schedule of events
for our March celebration. For
additional information, contact

DEMONSTRATE FOR WOMEN'S LIVES

If you are one of the millions
of men and women who support the
right to choose (whether or not
you have a child), join with us
to demand:

-A woman's right to choose
-Stop the terrorist attacks on
women's clinics

-No more social service cutbacks.
We want decent education, health-
care and food.

This demonstration is being
co-sponsored by All People's
Congress, NOW, and the Pro-Choice
Communications Network.

Also note: NOW is planning
"March for Women’s Lives" in
Washington D.C., Sunday, March

which abortion is acceptable, what
are the disabled to think? “We
don't want you; you should have
never been born." Moreover,
selective abortion opens the door
to some grave possibilities. What
if a gene is discovered for homo-
sexuality? For obesity? Will
post-amniocentesis abortion become
a routine way to make the population
uniform?

Another outrage is “gendercide,”
the abortion of fetuses because
they're female (or, occasionally,
male). Gendercide is inexcusable.

But it should not be illegal.

As with censorship of pornography,

I believe preference for sons is

a matter for education and activism,
not the law. The fact that abor-
tion can be used to weed out un-
wanted types of people must not

be used as an argument against
legal abortion.

Although it's been said before,
it's worth reiterating that the anti-
abortion movement, which insists
it is based on respect for human
life, is concerned only with life
before birth. The one-year-old
exhibiting the "failure to thrive"
syndrome because of malnutrition,
the six-year-old who lacks the
stamina to learn to read, the 13-
year-old raped by her father, the
15-year-old pregnant because
motherhood seems her ticket to
adult privilege, the 24-year-old
with no schooling, no job, no home,
the 75-year-old living on dog food
in an unheated room, the 85-year-
old living in her own urine in a
substandard proprietary home--
these human lives are of no inter-
est. They can look out for them-
selves; society and the law need
not be responsive to their rights
to live.

Real concern for fetal and em-
bryonic life would mean insisting
that all pregnant women and poten-
tial mothers have adequate nutri-
tion, housing, and earning ability.

No Apology

It's also worth mentioning that
in large part, the anti-abortion
forces oppose birth control, sex
education, homosexuality, nonmarital
sex, and even masturbation--
in other words, all forms of sex
except intercourse within marriage
for the purpose of procreation.

(A liberal wing of the movement
authorizes non-procreative sex

in marriage.) This attitude is

a dead giveaway that it is not
fetal/embryonic life the movement
cares about; but sex for pleasure.

One more thing to keep in mind
is that by and large, the same
people oppose divorce, comparable
worth, affirmative action, and
legal protection for battered
women and children. In the words
of feminist historian Linda Gordon,
"They are reacting not merely to a
"loosening of morals" but to the
whole feminist struggle of the
last century: they are fighting
for male supremacy."

I know this is a cliché, but
it's important to remember. In
fighting for free, safe, legal
abortion, we are fighting for the
very crux of women's rights--
the right to be treated, and con-
sidered, as human beings.

The pro-choice label has led
us up a blind alley. Abortion is
a non-negotiable human right.
Let's say so.

Walker’s and Spielberg's major ver-
sonification of this, and the part
is powerfully played for both its
tragic and dynamic potential by
Oprah Winfrey. Spielberg, however,
chose to cut her most powerful
speech indicting white people from
the screenplay. Many of us left
wanting to hear more from Sophia,
both to hear her conclusions from
her experiences and to see more of
Winfrey's potential in this part.
The oppression of women and
women as survivors against the odds
is another theme which comes across
with better success. Jeff Simon,
in his holiday season review of the
film for the Buffalo News was quick
to point out this theme. His in-
terpretation, however, is that this
movie is too "man-hating" for his
taste, though he has talked to wo-
men who have liked it. (Another
indication of Simon's inability to
face reality when it comes to male
faults - he thought last year's
television movie on incest to be
too anti-male also). This film
was not even as “pro-woman” as it
could have been. Celie’s husband's
reforms are played up to the hilt
at the end of the film - there was
little editing done in this regard.
All of us had some difficulty
with the editing done from book to
screen. There was so much else
we wanted to see. To be fair, I
imagine the book was a difficult
one to adapt to the screen. It
takes Celie from childhood to mid-
dle age, and mainly through the
vehicle of internal “letters” she
addresses to God and to her sister.
Still, all of us would have liked
to have seen fewer scenes of men
falling through shack roofs and
shutters falling off houses, and
more of the various characters'

difficult to keep track of who was
who, but it is quite understandable
on the whole.

There are a great deal of likable
things about the movie also. Per-
formances by the entire cast are
very powerful. Whoopi Goldberg
could not have made a better debut
as an actress, and Oprah Winfrey is
particularly outstanding.

Spielberg's cinematography shows
some wonderful scenes - blending
Celie's south with her sister's Af-
rica as Celie reads her sister's
letters, Mister’s face suddenly
appearing ominously in the window,
the fields of purple flowers.

The movie, whatever its faults,
drew tears, laughter and shouts of
"tell 'em, Sister!" from an entire
audience riveted to its seats.

(One warning for the unsuspecting
movie-goer: in a diverse audience
it is easy to become annoyed at

the catcalls and laughter which
seem to you to fall in the "wrong"
places).

The Color Purple is well worth
seeing for many reasons. Not the
least of these is that it will be
many, many long years before we
see another movie dealing at least
as well with the oppression of
women, lesbians and Blacks. If
you haven't already, though, do
read the book. You'll like that
even better.
