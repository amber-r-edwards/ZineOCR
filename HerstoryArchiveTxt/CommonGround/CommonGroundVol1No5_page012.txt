Out of Reach

All odd bulges -

Squeezed up features -
Grotesque mouth -
Misplaced eyes -

Taller than life -
Shorter than being -

Bent, twisted, misshapen,
Distorted, not real -

Yet, if you look

Into that person you know,
And not at the images;
Images, as in a Carney
Hall of mirrors;

He seems to be together,
The same,

What you understand.
That's what he thinks he is.
He's living with himself.

You're living with the images,

images as distilled
in alcohol.

And

Where do you touch?

a poem

“a poem should serve
as the knife
for the frozen sea
within us"

Kafka

change 'poem' to 'poem'
it cuts quicker

straight to the heart
change ‘knife’ to 'knife'
it cuts cleaner and deep
fine-honed, incisive,.

a poem hits its mark
with one swift thrust
overpowers pain's defense
and from the frozen sea
releases

a stream of burning

fire

Exorcism

I shall take a doll
dress it in pink
put it on a shelf
shut the door

call you a souvenir
+--nothing more

BECAUSE I WAS WAITING FOR THE WOMAN ARTICULATE IN HER BONES

Eyes skies blue tea morning snow you woolsey fur fat cat window
yes PB&J JMJ radiator flush shades and shadow fog vini vidi vici
light night stone sock vermillion telephone line earth wind and
one egg coddled lady ladybug fire engine boom wireless leaven
Sunday afternoon wonderful hug a bear boo the usual somewhat

silly perhaps.

Trying to summon words, any words I like, words for their sound,
words for function. Trying to think, feel in ways pleasing to
me, maybe to you. I want to ring true. I want to place the
bread on the table and say there, here or nothing at all.

You ask how I feel (and what am I going to do about it is implied).
I tell you I don't know. I am dying, flying, crying. Too fast
for telling. You tell me that I do not have to be articulate.

I do not have to be articulate. Surprise. Relief.

Why didn't someone tell me sooner?

You say you are not afraid to be seen,

but I am, and
I am sometimes afraid to see you.

Night Life

Suppose a dancer.
Suppose the moon a tambourine

Against her thigh.

Alice Todorovich

Pas de Deux

The peacock flaunts his glory

in stately pirouette,

feathered halo glowing, touched
by a lingering sun.

Where evening shadows creep

below the terrace
the peahen, spurning stale crumbs,
waits for the open gate.

Alice Todorovich

Time Races

she sends her seasons
in quick succession
like relay runners
on a track that
circles round

and round

and round,

as she speeds
she whirls

men's deeds like
colored leaves
in a brisk wind; they rustle
lift and swirl
for the moment
airborne

then flutter
soundlessly

back to

earth.

from men's hands
she snatches
hopes and dreams
too loosely held
and buries them
under blankets
of indifference.

there they lie
in limbo; frozen
but not dead
they wait the
warm breath

of some less
daunted dreamer.

Hawks’ Dance

angled into my hawk body
I swoop

I fly

always in silence
I am more hawk
than woman

not evil unless
strength is evil
I soar

I conquer

I scorn men
women

piercing

my hawk eyes

into

their flesh

Judy Trupin

as she runs

time warms; she

radiates the sun

that heals men's pain; she
sweats the rain

that swells new seeds
planted in pain's place
they burst forth
roots and tops
take hold and grow

green covers scarred earth.

as she passes

time ripens men's

lives: they bear fruit.
some, grown to fullness,
bear luscious fruit
deep-hued and sweet,
savored by all; others
embittered, bear bitter fruit;
it hangs shriveled on the
vine and poisons those so
desperate they partake;
yet others, cut too soon,
show pink-cheeked promise
their fruit is hard and
joyless to the taste.

time, eyes fixed

on her course,
heedless of all
outdistancing all
relentless,

races, races, races.
