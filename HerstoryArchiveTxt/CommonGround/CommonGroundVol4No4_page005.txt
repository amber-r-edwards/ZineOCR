THOUGHTS ON  
SUFFERING AND  

FORGIVENESS  

by Rev. Sarah M. Rieth  

As an Episcopal priest and  
pastoral psychotherapist, I do much  
of my ministry with women who have  
survived sexual abuse from their  
childhood years and with women who  
are currently involved in abusive  
relationships. As a Christian I am  
passionately concerned with enabling  
women and men to live with abundance,  
resilience, joy, love and mutuality.  
I believe that we were all created in  
God's image and that we were created  
to love and honor the sacredness of  
all life. As a Christian feminist I  
am saddened and challenged by the ways  
that I hear that the teachings of  
Christianity and scripture have been  
misappropriated, distorted and used  
as weapons against women who have al-  
ready been sexually or physically  
abused.  

Most children who grew up in a  
Sunday School within the Judaeo-  
Christian tradition learned the Ten  
Commandments as basic tenets of the  
faith. Imagine the confusion of a  
child who is learning in church or  
synagogue that it is essential to  
“honor your father and mother"  
(Exodus 20:12, Revised Standard Ver-  
sion) while at home she is being  
sexually abused by father and not  
protected by mother. How can the  
child honor her parents? How can  
she not honor her parents?  

The need is for the church to  
teach about sexual abuse and other  
forms of family violence. Equally  
important is for clergy and lay per-  
sons to be sanctuary for the abused;  
to be open and receptive to hearing  
the stories of the abused, and to  
make appropriate protective and re-  
medial interventions into family  
violence. Not to do so and to  
honor the fifth commandment more  
than the sacredness of the life of  
the abused person is to perpetuate  

the violence and to collude with the  
family's dysfunction.  

Jesus' words to Peter were that  
we are called to forgive "seventy  
times seven" (Matthew 18:22, RSV);  
that is, to forgive an infinite num-  
ber of times. Yesterday I heard that  
passage quoted yet again as the rea-  
son a woman remained in a violent re-  
lationship. I believe that we are  
called and challenged to “forgive the  
wrongs that others have done to us"  
(Matthew 6:12, Good News Bible). I  
am certain that the survival of this  
planet depends on our being vessels  
of love and forgiveness which are  
powers without limit in the universe.  
Jesus tells us to forgive infinitely,  
but Jesus does not tell us to remain  
forever in abusive situations. For-  
giving and going back for more are  
two different things. It is possible  
to forgive and also to distance one-  
self from chronic abuse.  

Most Christians were raised with  
the ideal of growing into the like-  
ness of Christ. We are taught that  
it is not for us to avoid suffering.  
Rather, Jesus says that whoever  
“wants to come with me...must for-  
get herself, carry her cross and  
follow me" (Mark 8:34, RSV adapted).  
There is a holy awe at picking up  
one's cross and following Christ on  

a path of suffering, death and new  
life. Yet too often women introject  
this teaching so fully that they  
come to believe that they are no-  
thing, that all suffering is God's  
will, and that all suffering is re-  
demptive. Much of what I have ex-  
perienced in my life as suffering  
has been redemptive: I have been  
brought to new growth, new and re-  
stored relationships, new life with-  
in and renewed faith. But I know  
too well in myself and in other wo-  
men that tendency to remain in what  
I call “Masochistic unredemptive  
suffering." To remain as a victim  
in life, battered, used and abused,  
is not God's will for us and it is  
not redemptive suffering. Most ab-  
used women experience their suffer-  
ing as purposeless, hopeless and  
meaningless. Jesus chose to walk  
the path he walked with his eyes  
open, his options clear to him,  

and he entered into suffering with  
love, a strong sense of self, in-  
tentionality, direction and purpose.  
I believe that his is the pattern  
upon which we can model our own re-  
sponse when life brings suffering to  
us.  

I shudder to imagine how much  
domestic violence has been perpetra-  
ted in the name of "Wives, be subject  
to your husbands” (Ephesians 5:22,  
RSV). That verse is often used out  
of context in order for men to control  
“their” women. The full context of  
the verse is one of mutuality in re-  
lationships, mutual respect and for-  
giveness. The passage is about the  
mystery which love is; it is not  
about persons controlling one another.  

We who are the church are called  
to be both prophetic and pastoral in  
the realm of sexual abuse and other  
family violence. The Story of the  
Good Samaritan in Luke 10:29-37 speaks  
to us of a compassionate response to  
a bruised and battered victim/survi-  

Family violence is not acceptable.  
Every woman can make a beginning in  
stopping the epidemic of family vio-  
lence by disabusing herself of the  
notion that living with violence is  
normal, acceptable, and one's Christ-  
ian duty.

COMMON GROUND DECEMBER 1985 PAGE 4  

A year ago I was asked to  
preach in the chapel at the seminary I  
attended. It was the custom for each  
senior to take her or his turn sometime  
during this final year to offer the  
scripture and interpretation to the  
assembled body of faculty and students.  
Fall, and my turn, fell simultaneously.  
As "Snoopy" might begin, "It was a  
dark and stormy time..."  

The onset of senior status brought  

many blessings, not the least of which  
was that the end was in sight. But  
the end also held some anxiety for  
each of us, particularly the women, as  
we filled out form after form and  
waited for what seemed endless weeks  
to be called for interviews and pos-  
sible jobs. My message that October  
day was one of hope. Yet, as the  
weeks and months passed, it was  
harder and harder to hold on to  
that hope. “Is there life after  
seminary?" we would ask one another,  
trying to be encouraging and positive.  
Yet we consciously realized the bitter-  
sweet implications of our cajoling.  
At the same time, we would truly re-  
joice with our brothers who received  
notice that they had been "called" to  
positions in ministry. Many of them  
were sensitive to our position. Some  
were not.  

Winter came, followed all too close-  
ly by Spring. Graduation was upon us.  
Student loan repayment forms arrived a  
week after commencement. Some of my  
sisters did receive job confirmations,  
but many of these were for positions  
which did not necessarily require the  
possession of a seminary education or  
were temporary “interim" positions.  

A few were hired by churches that  
“couldn't afford a man." As a single  
parent, I was geographically more  
limited than most. A few good options  
appeared: three times I had heard that  
committees had narrowed their choices  
to another candidate (male) and me.  
Each time, a letter arrived saying,  
“We thank you for your interest but..."  

Prior to ordination I was  

Just about a  

preach in the chapel  

IS THERE LIFE  
AFTER SEMINARY  

offered a part-time class as a  

position in my home church,  
seated very similar to the one I had  
before ever entering seminary. Many  
voiced their concern that I was over  
qualified, while others thought it  
was good to have a woman in that posi-  
tion because, after all, women could  
live on less money than men. Yes,  
there was indeed "Life After Seminary."  
But the quality of that life was not  
necessarily equal. One week after  
ordination I was called by another  
denomination to a full-time position  
as Associate Pastor in a large subur-  
ban church. The decision to accept  
was not made lightly. It was diffi-  
cult to turn away from my home  

church which had given me consider-  
able financial support during semi-  
nary. I thought carefully about my  
indebtedness. It was only then that  

I realized that what I "owed" them  
was to do the work of ministry for  
which I had been prepared.  

I have been in this charge since  
August, the first woman pastor in the  
congregation's history. Initially,  
some concern was voiced as to whether  
I would "push” the women's issue.  
Folks here did not realize that it  
was they who were doing the pushing  
for women clergy by having the in-  
tegrity to follow the Gospel, and  
modeling sound and integrated ministry  
which is based upon the gifts and  
talents of qualified male and female  
ministers. At no time have I been  
given the impression that I will have  
to “prove” myself.  

Some of my sisters who are ordain-  
ed clergy have not been so fortunate.  
It is for them and those who will come  
after us for whom my heart still cries.  
I stand with them and urge them not to  
give up. The truth of the Gospel,  
that "in Christ there is neither male  
nor female..." will ultimately pre-  
vail.  

Yes, there is life after seminary,  
and if this is your aspiration, fol-  
low it through. Go to seminary and  
become the minister your mother always  
wanted you to marry!  

GETTING  

Every woman's dream is to have a  
warm, lighted home at the Holidays  
filled with marvelous smells and  
beautifully wrapped presents for her  
loved ones. Unfortunately, that  
dream can turn into an impossibility  
if divorce, widowhood or unemployment  
rear their ugly heads.  

Recently, The Buffalo News printed  
that divorced women can expect a 73%  
decline in their standard of living  
the first year after a divorce. So-  
cial Security and Unemployment alone  
certainly isn't enough to live on in  
this day and age. The government has  
had to step in and give a hand. If  
you fit into one of these categories,  
then it’s best to be prepared - to  
think ahead.
