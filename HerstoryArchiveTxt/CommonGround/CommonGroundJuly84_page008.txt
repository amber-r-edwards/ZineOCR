When I was asked to write a review
of Alice Walker's In Search of Our
Mothers' Gardens, I did mental back-
flips with excitement. I had just
finished Walker's The Color Purple
and couldn't wait to sample her new-
est literary offering. (If you have
not yet read The Color Purple you are
missing out on one of the finest
books ever written by an American.
In fact, I am so sure you'll love
this book, I predict that after read-
ing it you'll be tempted to call me
and say, "You were right, Judi, it's
a wonderful book!" But, please, no
calls between midnight and 7 a.m.!)

In Search of Our Mothers' Gardens
is a collection of essays, reviews
and speeches written by Alice Walker
between 1970 and 1983. Although the
writings vary in style and subject,
common themes are touched upon
throughout: the pricelessness of
our herstorical heritage; a deep con-
cern with black feminists within the
feminist community on one hand and
the black community on the other; a
commitment to enlarging the audience
for black American writers of the
past; and memories - really rumina-
tions from some years distance - of
the civil rights movement during the
1960s.

This is an eclectic collection of
work and I am at once bursting to
write about it and hesitant - not
knowing where to begin. Suffice to
say that after reading it one knows
Alice Walker in one of the most tel-
ling ways: through the influences on
her life. Through this book we meet
her deeply religious mother; her
brutal father; the brothers she did
not like and the one she did; her
husband, daughter, lover, and, per-
haps the most significant influence
of all for an author, the writers
who have touched her. The pieces
that struck me most - and which I
find myself referring back to as I
write this review - are her essays
about these other writers and the
art of writing. Not only does she
lend keen insight into the works of
Flannery O'Connor, Zora Neale Hur-
ston, Jean Toomer, but with finesse
explores the craft and vision of
writing. In “Saving the Life That
Is Your Own" she says:

I write not only what I want

to read--understanding fully
and indelibly that if I don't
do it no one else is so vital-
ly interested or capable of
doing it to my satisfaction--

I write all the things I SHOULD
HAVE BEEN ABLE TO READ. Con-
sulting, as belatedly discovered
models, those writers--most of
whom, not surprisingly, are wo-
men--who understood that their
experience as ordinary human
beings was also valuable, and
in danger of being misrepresent-
ed, distorted, or lost. (p. 13)

ALICE

She delves into the bearing her
life as a Southern black has had on
her work. After sadly acknowledging
the inherent racism of Faulkner, a

writer whom she had once admired, she

says in "The Black Writer and the
Southern Experience":

No one could wish for a more ad-
vantageous heritage than that be-
queathed to the black writer in
the South: a compassion for the
earth, a trust in humanity beyond
our knowledge of evil, and an
abiding love of justice. We in-
herit a great responsibility as
well, for we must give voice to
centuries not only of silent bit-
terness and hate but also of nei-
ghborly kindness and sustaining
love. (p. 21)

"Beyond the Peacock" is a wonderful,
loving essay about Flannery O'Connor
and about Walker's mother who figures
prominently in this piece. Other
writers to whom entire essays are de-
voted are Jean Toomer, Zora Neale
Hurston and Rebecca Jackson. Actual-
ly, Zora Hurston has two pieces about
her in the book. The second one,
"Looking for Zora", is at once sad
and amusing as Walker describes her
search for Hurston's unmarked grave
in a segregated cemetery in Florida.
In several of these essays, Walker
verbalizes her anger at black men
whom she feels on many occasions have
been guilty of verbal and attitudinal
as well as physical abuse toward
black women. In "If the Past Looks
Like the Present", "To THE BLACK
SCHOLAR", "Brothers and Sisters" and
especially “Looking to the Side and
Back" she explains her bitterness to-
ward the men and toward black women
who condone this kind of behavior.
At one point she describes a panel
discussion she attends where a promi-
nent black woman treats her
to a lecture on the black woman's
responsibilities to the black man.
I will never forget my sense of
horror and betrayal when one of
the panelists said to me (and to
the rest of that august body of
black women gathered there): "The
responsibility of the black woman
is to support the black man; what-
ever he does."
It occurred to me that my neck
could be at that moment under some
man's heel, and this woman would
stroll by and say, "Right on."

I burst into the loudest tears
I've ever shed. And though I
soon dried my face, I didn't
stop crying inside for...Maybe

I haven't stopped yet. But that's
okay; what I'm crying about is
worth it. (p. 317)

She also has cutting (and I be-
lieve well-deserved) criticism for
white feminists who continue to dis-
miss black feminists by believing
them to be more committed to racial
justice than to justice between the
sexes, as if the two couldn't be
spoken about in the same breath.

WALKER

Walker's thoughts here also en-
compass the nuclear freeze, contin-
uous Israeli-Arab cries in the Middle
East, separate tributes to Dr. Martin
Luther King, Jr. and Coretta Scott
King, and a fascinating essay on how
she came to write The Color Purple.
These are good, logical, interesting.
But the best piece in this volume is
the title essay "In Search of Our
Mothers' Gardens", her inspired les-
son in black women artists of the
past, whose talent was never recog-
nized or encouraged.

For these grandmothers and

mothers of ours were not Saints

but Artists; driven to a numb

and bleeding madness by the

springs of creativity in them

for which there was no release.

They were Creators, who lived

lives of spiritual waste, be-

cause they were so rich in
spirituality--which is the basis
of Art--that the strain of endur-
ing their unused and unwanted
talent drove them insane. Throw-
ing away this spirituality was
their pathetic attempt to lighten
the soul to a weight their work-
worn, sexually abused bodies
could bear. (p. 233)

Obviously some of the essays con-
tained herein will be of more inter-
est to the reader than others, depend-
ing on individual feelings and opin-
ions; but, read all of them because
there is much to learn here. Alice
Walker is one of the nation's great
literary talents and this book takes
us on a journey which should not be
missed into her mind, spirit and core
beliefs.

Do Alice a favor: buy this book.

Do yourself a favor: read it!
