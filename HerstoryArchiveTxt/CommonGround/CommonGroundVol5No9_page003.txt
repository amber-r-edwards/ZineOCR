POLICY  

PHILOSOPHY - Common Ground is potentially, with  
help from Western New York women, a forum to  
celebrate the rich diversity of our community. We view  
the paper as a ribbon that may connect our com-  
monalities, our intersection points. We are inviting you  

to participate actively in the building of a support system  

for WNY women. We affirm our commitment to enhance  
the lives of women on physical, educational, spiritual,  
psychological, social and economic levels. We want to  
present, fair-mindedly, the issues that concern women,  
and information of value to women. We offer Common  
Ground as a place where women can display their art  
and personal literature, and review the tapestries of their  
experiences.  

EDITORIAL POLICY - Common Ground is especially  
looking for articles which address the needs and interests  
of local women.  

1. Common Ground is a publication of news, culture  
and dialogue from women’s perspectives.  

2. News, Opinion, Analysis and Commentary will  
each be clearly labeled as such.  

3. We are seeking to provide accurate, straightforward  
information of value to women.  

4. The collective will not intentionally print or sup-  
port materials or viewpoints which will harm women  
because of color, sexuality, religious or ethnic  
background, physical disability or economic situation.  

5. While opinions expressed in Common Ground are  
those of the authors and not necessarily those of the col-  
lective as a whole, we do accept responsibility for choos-  
ing what we print.  

SUBMISSIONS — We welcome articles, letters, infor-  
mation, and announcements of interest to women.  
Graphics, cartoons, art and photography will be gratefully  
received. We especially invite women who do not  
usually have access to traditional media - women of col-  
or, differently abled, economically or educationally  
disadvantaged, and those for whom English is a second  
language - to write. Suggested length of letters: 250  
words. Letters must be signed to be printed. We will,  
however, respect your privacy and withhold your name  
if you request. Suggested length of articles, commentary,  
analysis: 500-750 words. Please type and double space  
your work, 40 characters across. If you do not have ac-  
cess to a typewriter, please print clearly. In time we hope  
to have a typewriter, paper, etc., available for those who  
request it. Include a stamped, self-addressed envelope  
and work and home phone numbers. Because we want  
to hear your voices, if your piece needs to be edited for  
length or clarity, we will call you/ask you to do it. Keep  
copies of your work. We will try to notify you within  
three (3) weeks if we intend to use your work. If we print  
it, we will give you five (5) copies of the issue in which  
it appears. Artwork should be black and white copies  
only, and title/describe your work. We will copyright the  
entire issue, but the copyright on each piece reverts to  
the author/artist, that she may decide where her work  
is printed. Please request a style-sheet for further infor-  
mation and guidelines if you want to write.
