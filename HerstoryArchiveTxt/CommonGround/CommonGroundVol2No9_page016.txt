This could be the LAST

COMMON
GROUND

ever. Unless...

We can increase our resources - both human and financial - to keep our commitment to be a forum
for all women in Western New York.

Our wonderful collective of 30 dedicated women has been taxed to the limit covering all the stories,
writing them, typing them, putting them all together - and then finding enough subscribers and
advertisers to print them!

We would love your help. If you have time, come and join the collective - it's a great experience.
If you are already over-committed, perhaps you can help by getting friends to subscribe or by

encouraging friends in business to advertise and/or distribute the paper.

Common Ground is a good thing for everyone in our community. We want to keep up with the news,

keep getting better and keep it all together.
