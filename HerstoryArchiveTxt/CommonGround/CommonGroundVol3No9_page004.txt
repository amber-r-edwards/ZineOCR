Emick Sentenced ......

And some of the pressure was
frightening. On April 10, state po-
lice and sheriff's deputies were
situated among the courtroom spec-
tators, and the sheriff himself never
relaxed for a second. Previous
appearances had had only ordinary
security, so later I asked why.
"There were threats," Cleary told me,
and the sheriff said he feared vio-
lence because of the extremely vola-
tile feelings about the case. Per-
haps better than anyone, the police—
who generally favored a prison sen-
tence themselves—realized how ex-
plosive were the voices demanding
Emick pay heavily.

Earlier, I quoted some men's
opinions. The women I interviewed
ranged from friends who feel, like
me, that Emick was innocent, to
strangers on the street. They don't
want to see Emick in prison. But
one and all they're exasperated with
her. "I could have shaken that girl!"
cried one public official in her
sixties. Another elderly woman said,
"My sympathies were with her until
she got pregnant again. What's
the matter with her? It...didn't
show good sense. She was a battered
wife, but this is terribly foolish.”

Many others support Emick all the
way, and acknowledge her right to
be pregnant. But they seem to be a
minority. "I don’t think she's con-
ducted herself very well lately,”
said Anna Babcock of Wellsville,
about 70. "I can't understand her
getting pregnant again. I can see
making one mistake, but she should
have learned by now." (Incidentally,
to Emick, getting pregnant is a tri-
umph and a joy, as is the marriage.
She loves her children, is an enthu-
siastic mother, and wants more.)

Ann Margeson, a fifty-ish Well-
sville mother who is active in commun-
ity affairs (her son is the local
police chief), commented, “I had a
lot of support for her before, but
when I heard she was married and
pregnant, I had mixed feelings. I
thought she'd be smarter than that.
I did feel sorry for her, but when
I heard (about the pregnancy), I
thought, "Come on, lady, you can do
better than that!"

And a feminist in her thirties
wanted to see Emick learn to stand
on her own before taking on a second

child. "With all that hanging over
her, I’m surprised at her getting
pregnant," she said. “It's bound to
make it harder to study to be a
nurse."

If Emick—at least partly, sub-
consciously—got pregnant to avoid
going to jail, I am a woman who would
go to jail to avoid getting pregnant.
From that perspective, I think we've
all been unfair to her. She is no
radical. She's no more than a luke-
warm, equal-pay-for-equal-work fem-
inist. She's not ambitious; she's
not a leader. She's Leslie, naive,
idealistic, trusting, and above all
very young. At 15, she got involved
with a man who eventually beat her
with unthinkable instruments, raped
her, tortured her sexually, burned
her, hanged her, and systematically
destroyed her personhood. At 23,
she killed him. During those eight
years, her growth was arrested.
After the killing, she emerged with
the emotional maturity and romantic
outlook of a not especially intellec-
tual 15-year-old.

She had a lot of catching up to
do, and she's doing it—but it takes
time. In the two years since her
arrest (when she weighed 80 pounds
and looked like a concentration camp
survivor, with a furtive, darting
gaze and a shuffling hunched walk);
she has grown into a straight, tall,
lively, well-dressed woman of com-
posure and warmth. Every time I see

her, she looks stronger and healthier.
Nonetheless, she has always re-
minded me of a very small mouse sur-
rounded by large cats; the enormous
Clearys; Judge Freeman in his long
black robes; Pat Fogarty, tall and
sturdy in her suits and heels; dozens
of confident, assertive reporters.
With the addition of her husband,

who is reserved but definite, the
circle is one cat larger, and it
continues to guard her, protect her,
and run her life. Perhaps by getting
pregnant she was saying, "Hey! I’m
Leslie, and this is my life."

The case has been a crossroads of
ideas and forces. It's been the
intersection of feminism, the social
service professions, and the extreme
masculine right wing, symbolized by
pickup trucks with rifles on a rack,
by barefoot-and-pregnant wives conni-
ving in their own slavery.

It's been a watershed for me.

My other writing—I'm a reporter for
a small town daily—done in a
context where arresting and trying
Leslie was a reasonable thing.
Writing about police and court action
daily, I tend to forget how outland-
ish that context is. Every day, I
report the actions of the police and
courts; but we never tell the other
side of the story. This is wrong,
and it may be the reason I’ll even-
tually get out of the news business
—if I can, before it warps me com-
pletely. Maybe it already has.

But there are real questions, and
I don't have any answers. What
about the man who beats an old woman
for her Social Security check? What
of the drunk driver? The rapist?
The man who hits his 7-year-old son
on the head with a hammer? (That's
another pending Allegany County
case.) Should we do nothing? Or
do we need police, but a different
set of laws? It's easy to say “Free
all political prisoners," but what
about the man with a hammer? He is
a victim too, but so is his son.

I try to look at the Emick case
with a feminist eye, not an Allegany
County eye. But I live here. While
the jury was out, I said, "If they
find her guilty, I'll never feel the
same about Allegany County.” They
did, and I don't; but I still love
it, and maybe I love it all the more
because I see it clearer. There's
no point in loving something if you
don't see it for what it really is.
You're just loving a picture you've
drawn in your mind. That isn't love;
it's self-deception. If I'm going
to love Allegany County, I have to
love its warts, men with guns,
blind-headed juries and all.

The same goes for Leslie Emick.
She's Leslie, not a symbol of women's
oppression. Feminism is for all
women, not just the politically
correct ones. The old woman who
wanted to shake Leslie (but didn't
want to be quoted in this paper!)
is a woman too.

Pro-Choice Speak-Out

The Pro-Choice Communications Net-
work of Buffalo has decided to parti-
cipate in the National Freedom of
Choice Speak-Out Campaign, sponsored
by the National Abortion Rights Action
League (NARAL). The purpose of this
campaign is to refocus the media's
attention onto women. The Network
feels that it is time again to tell
the story of the hundreds of thousands
of women and girls who have had a
personal experience with abortion.
They feel we need now, more than ever,
to tell why freedom to choose a safe
and legal abortion is a fundamental
and moral right for every woman.

The following plans are being made,
and help is needed:

Letter-writing campaign: Letters
are needed from individuals, as well
as their friends, colleagues and
group’s members which recount personal
experiences. You can tell your own
story, your friend's, your wife's or
your mother's. Letters may be ad-
dressed to NARAL, or to any elected
official. Full names are requested,
but first name, city and zip code
will do. (See sample letter on re-
source page of this issue.)

Local speak-out: This event is
being planned for Monday, May 20th
at 7:30 pm at the Unitarian Church,
695 Elmwood Ave. in the Parish Hall.
It will be held in conjunction with
the national speak-out in Washington,
D.C. Women and men who have had a
personal experience with legal and
illegal abortions are needed to tell
their story. Those interested should
contact the Pro-Choice Network (see
resource page).

Money: As always, money is needed
if this campaign is to be carried
out. Costs of phone calls, flyers,
equipment, etc. need to be covered.
If you or a group you belong to can
contribute, checks should be made out
and sent to the Pro-Choice Communica-
tions Network.

Since the local N.O.W. already
has an ongoing letter writing cam-
paign we invite anyone interested who

feels they need help in drafting a
letter to meet with us on Monday May
6th at Planned Parenthood at 7 pm.
Paper, pens, advice and support will
be cheerfully given!

For a sample letter and a clip-out
coupon to indicate how you might
help in this campaign, see page
14 of this issue.

ABOUT LETTERS TO THE EDITORS:

This space is reserved for our
readership and community members to
tell us what they like, don't like
or wish we'd do differently. We do
not expect anyone to agree with
everything printed in Common Ground.
If something tickles you, infuriates
you, makes you think or makes you
want to respond, we think that is
great. We expect our readership to
help us strike a balance, search
out new ideas, options and viewpoints.
We hope you understand the approach
we have taken with our editorial poli-
cy: we are providing access to ideas,
and even if you disagree with some-
thing presented, we think we have
helped you strengthen your own view.
Better still, you might find a new
way of looking at something, or
gather an insight into how other
women make their choices.
Common Ground is a reader-sponsored
paper, and therefore is also a reader
responsive paper. As much as is
possible, we will be open to our
readership about who we are and how
we make decisions. Please write!
Letters will be printed on a space-
available basis and dependent on
the timeliness of the issue.

Thank you,

Common Ground

Dear Common Ground,

On several occasions, I have
started to write this letter and
each time I have tossed my efforts
in the trash can, thinking it would
be presumptuous of me, a Virginia
resident, to voice my opinion about
a paper published for women in the
Buffalo area, a place I have never
even visited. Nevertheless, of the
several papers and magazines I re-
ceive in the mail, CG is the one I
look forward to the most.

February's CG includes a letter
from Bonnie Richardson, who writes
that she is leaving the Buffalo area
and asks that her name be removed
from your mailing list. She complains
about your failure "to become an im-
portant News Journal for WNY women"
and criticizes your “poorly written
sloppy poetry and articles" on irrel-
evant topics rather than "serious
political analysis."

I am not a poetry critic, but I
enjoy some of the poems you print.
More important to me than their true
literary value is the willingness of
women I do not know and will never
meet to share with me this most in-
timate form of writing.

Richardson expresses her disap-
pointment that the January issue
devotes a full page to an article
on dieting while a letter concerning
the Hoetzer and Cook article is
“buried in small print on a back
page." Her most abrasive comments
are directed at your new "Woman of
the Month" column and its interview
with nurse Anne Montes.

She ends her remarks by saying,
“A certain amount of down home folksy
articles are fine—but there are
many different women and we need
more variety than CG provides."

Some of the articles I have liked
best are the very ones she would
have you delete. Is there something
wrong with me because I prefer to
read an article on dieting to one
concerning those politicians who
should be supported by the "Caucasian
feminists in the middle to upper
economic strata"? Having spent a
large part of my life stuffing food
into my mouth, trying to compensate
for those things our male-money-status
oriented society has denied me, and
having lived the diet/binge syndrome
for so long, trying to obtain the
body shape that same society dictates
I should have, that particular article
was one of the first items I read in
the January CG.

Not being highly educated or poli-
tically sophisticated and not being
in the “middle to upper economic
strata" (even though they still let
us poor folks vote down here in
Virginia), I just skimmed through
the letter concerning the Hoetzer
and Cook article.

Don't get me wrong. Criticism of
that letter or any of CG’s content
is not intended. I agree with Rich-
ardson's statement that there "are
many different women." I am one of
them, and some of us “down home
folksy" types do not understand or
identify with her reading preferences.
However, I would not suggest that
you deny her an opportunity to read
the kind of articles she likes. At
the same time, I ask that you not
omit items written by women who—as
you state in your submissions policy—
are “of color, differently abled,
economically or educationally disad-
vantaged, and those for whom English
is a second language."

I love the interview with Anne
Montes. Here is a strong, brave
woman who resists being interviewed
because she “doesn't like to blow
[her] own horn." With the interview-
er's gentle encouragement, she re-
lates a story with which many women

are familiar: working behind the
scenes for low pay and almost no
glory and having the credit for one's
accomplishments go to someone "high-
er up," usually a man. Yet patiently,
persistently, she continues to do
what one likes to think a person
becomes a nurse to do—saving lives.
How sad that Richardson misses the
true message in this woman's story
and pounces instead upon her use of
male pronouns to refer to doctors!
What does it matter that “40 percent
of all medical students at UB have
been women for the last five years"?
Obviously, they are not the doctors
this nurse has had to work with (or
around).

In each issue I read at least one
or two items that seem to shine in
some special way. My favorites in
the January issue are Siaron Green's
“Potpourri” column on how each of us,
in our own way, can help make a dif-
ference in our world, and Rene Radec-
ki's "Fragile Moment,” in which she
shares with your readers a young
mother's experience of almost losing
her child to illness. These are the
kinds of articles that make me stand
by my mailbox and leaf through CG
before I even carry it back to the
house.

Now, if you must change CG and
"broaden its base” to suit Richard-
son's tastes, won't you also continue
to print—among those "articles from
women law professors, sociologists...
lawyers, doctors, executives"—the
kind that I and others like me can
enjoy.

So, even though I live far from
Buffalo, I am going to mail this
letter to you. If I don't tell you
how much I like CG, maybe others
won't tell you either, and you will
think all your readers agree with
Richardson. This one does not.

Sincerely,

Chris Bowen
