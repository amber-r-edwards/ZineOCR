$$$ for Women’s Groups

Eleven women's groups announced
that they have joined
together to raise awareness
about the financial needs of organizations that work on behalf of
women's rights. These Washington-
based non-profit groups are all eligible to receive funds through the
Fall Combined Federal Campaign,

which opened in September.

Past history of the distribution
of funds from the United Way Campaigns shows that programs to help
women and minorities have been underserved. For four years the federal
budget has cut domestic programs
to aid women and children. Today,
private and corporate philanthropy
grants less than 3% of charitable
gifts to women's groups. The time
has come for women to expand and
direct their personal giving towards

those organizations which work for
them.

Avril Madison, Executive Director
of Wider Opportunities for Women
and spokeswoman for the groups stated,
"Women are opening their pocketbooks
now for an annual gift to the Combined Federal Campaign. They should
be aware that the organizations
which work to get their fair share
need financial support. The connection

defined as "any female person who
is not married to the actor (rapist)."
The exceptions to this law are women
who are living apart from their husbands
according to a court order, and
women not living with their husbands
because of a separation agreement,
but only if the agreement states
that forced sexual intercourse by the
estranged husband will constitute a
crime.

Mario Wiberto's case challenges
the rape statute from one perspective,
but many women's groups are
challenging these laws from the
point of view of the wife/victim.
Sarah Wunsch, staff attorney at the
Center for Constitutional Rights,
presenter of an amicus (friend of
the court) brief on behalf of the

victim, said that
the current rape laws are based on a

notion of wives as the property of their
husbands. These concepts violate
the constitutional rights of
privacy and bodily autonomy
to wives, even against invasion by
husbands.

Ruby Green, who heads the Erie
County Citizens Committee on Rape
and Sexual Assault, said, “If you
are a victim of rape in the marital
situation, you have a very sad kind
of law." "As it is;
we live in a society that tends to
blame the victim. Our hope in being
included in the amicus brief was that
the law be changed,
that married women be given not only
the courage but the legal ability to
stand up and do something about this
sad situation.

She continued, "We must be heard."

CATHOLICS

A Bishop John
of St.
Louis has said the Conference
of Catholic Bishops should own the
“wimp" position on the Equal Rights
Amendment.

The bishop's conference fully
supports the goal of justice,
adding that "We
have also been alert to the possible

describing the

stand as

extreme middle."
May 5 supports

the intervention between the sexes,

and the prevailing implications."
The prevailing implications
are the possible legal and social
implications of the Amendment.

The bishops term “the rights of the unborn” is what the
bishop's conference is now contemplating endorsing the ERA with
a critique of the Senate bill
attached. It reads,

The Church of England's main governing
body has voted to uphold the
ordination of women to be ordained as
priests in the church, despite opposition
from the Archbishop of Canterbury,
its spiritual leader.

The General Synod of bishops and
laity voted 307 to 124
to allow the ordination of women.
The Archbishop of Canterbury said that he would vote against it to maintain unity within the church
and with other Christian groups,
mainly the Roman Catholic Church.

Many churches in the U.S.,
including the Episcopalians,
have ordained women.

THANKS!
For Helping

Every year, more than half a million people in Buffalo and Erie
County depend on services supported by your United Way
contributions. If they could thank you personally, they would.

Because by giving to this annual voluntary effort, you have
provided programs for senior citizens, therapy for the mentally
and physically handicapped, shelter for the homeless, comfort
for the sick.

If those whom you have helped could express their
appreciation, you would be convinced your gift is money well
spent. Your gifts have made the United Way truly a “People
Helping People” effort. And it will continue to be, as long as you
continue to care.

On behalf of those you helped, we would like to say, “Thanks for
helping people.”

The United Way.

The United Way of Buffalo & Erie County

The Rand Corporation's recent
study found that women's salaries
are gaining on men's--and that by
the year 2000, they will be 74%
of men's salaries if present trends
continue. The study concluded that
job experience and better education
have made the difference, not “political pressure," although the study
did not apparently explore the
impact "political pressure" may have
had in helping women obtain entry
to job experience and better education...

Simone de Beauvoir, author of
The Second Sex, recently quoted on
marriage: “I still think marriage
is obscene in the sense that it is
often a question of financial gain.
Confusing money with questions of
the heart and sexuality is what is
obscene..."

Although Agent Orange (dioxin)
has been found to cause a higher
incidence of reproductive problems
in females than males, there have
as yet been no studies done on the
effect Agent Orange may have had on
the approximately 17,000 women who
served in Vietnam. Some of these
women have reported suspected dis-
abilities or birth/pregnancy problems,
but cannot make claims for
compensation because they cannot
point to a definitive study which
links Agent Orange to their prob-
lems. The V.A. has recommended such
a study be done and the Agent Orange
Working Group is expected to make
a decision on the recommendation by
January 1985...

must ensure that the message of
choice is not drowned out by the
language of abortion. We must stop
the erosion of momentum towards com-
parable worth. We cannot allow women
to feel a sense of personal defeat.
The challenge facing us above all is
the development of a feminist agenda that
speaks to more women, that is not
dominated by the needs of white upwardly
mobile career women in their
20s and 30s, but rather an agenda
that includes the concerns of young
and old, Black, Brown, Yellow and
White, and defined in language that
can be heard by the majority of women.

THE GRIFFIN GAP

The most outstanding example of
the gender gap may well exist on a
local, not national level. There is
slightly over a 20 point difference
between the support of men and women
for Mayor James Griffin who will be
up for re-election next year.

Although a majority of men opt for
retention of the mayor, a majority
of women—regardless of their affiliation—prefer replacing him.

Democratic voters are still
slightly in favor of retaining the
Mayor, although the erosion of his
strength in the last year has been
spectacular. One year ago, Democrats
favored reelecting Griffin by a 3 to
1 margin; today his lead is narrowed
to about 2%. Republican voters, who
have less clout in the city, are
more strongly pro-Griffin.

However, all of these statistics
and the "Griffin Gap" measure support
and opposition without consideration
of any specific candidate opposing
the Mayor. The capacity of feminists
to unite behind a single acceptable
candidate and concretize the broader
women's base to defeat Jimmy Griffin
will be our most important challenge
in 1985.
