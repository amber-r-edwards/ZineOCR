Stories of Change in Women’s Lives

by Carol A. Kitchen

Twenty-five years ago, this coun-
try was in the throes of its response
to Sputnik. Students were charged to
study math and science, to become
engineers to catch our country up with
the space explorations of Russia. I
was a high school senior then. Want-
ing to please, I refocused my educa-
tional goals on a scientific career
and away from nursing. In my fresh-
man year of college, I registered
for chemistry, math and German. But
atoms and ions did not retain my in-
terest and I found myself completing
a major in German with minors in Rus-
sian and sociology.

My study of the Russian language
confirmed the suspicion I had nur-
tured since childhood, that in the
USSR were plenty of people whose main
interests resembled those of my own
family. They worked for the basics
of food, clothing and shelter. They
contributed to their community and
even had some time left over for fun.
Russian people sang, told jokes, and
enjoyed drama, music, ballet and
athletics.

Either the spirit of the sixties
or my own adolescent optimism led me
to believe that, while governments
played crazy games with bombs, hot
lines, and push buttons, ordinary
Americans like me were becoming more
and more aware of our counterparts in
other countries, including the USSR.
Our lives had no contact with the
news-grabbing military sector in our
respective nations. Indeed, the Bol-
shoi Ballet visited this country,
and my boss took a tour of the USSR.
Doors seemed to be opening!

IS IT ONLY
THE RUSSIANS?

Then what happened? Did more
Americans learn the Russian language?
No. Did the number of human inter-
est stories about Russian people in-
crease in our newspapers and maga-
zines? No. People returned from
their tours with reports that Rus-
sian households lacked modern
American conveniences. They were

way behind us in the development of
gadgetry, despite Sputnik. And we
stopped reaching out to learn from
Russians. Interest in sharing ideas
with Russian people diminished. Col-
lege instructors of Russian had fewer
students. Their small departments
dried up. And twenty-five years
later, another generation of Ameri-
cans remains as ignorant as their
parents of the shapers of Russian
thinking; of the current lifestyle
of the average Russian person. Why
has this happened?

Could it be that our imperialism
is far stronger today than we would
like to believe? Could it be that
we cannot interact with people from
other countries unless there is a
strong chance of our gaining a one-
up position? We can visit England
or France or Greece and enjoy their
differences. We can decry the avail-
ability of McDonald's throughout
Europe, and then come home, assured
that the US is a bigger, more power-
ful, and therefore better country.

I wonder how much of our patriotism
stems from putting other countries
down.

Our government is warning us of
the military power of the USSR, as
it did thirty years ago. Our own
military power frightens me more.
And I am not interested in military
power anyway. I am interested in
what people who happen to live in
the USSR are thinking about. How
are they meeting their basic needs
today? How do they socialize today?
How important is Easter to them this
year, or has another spring holiday
evolved?

Just what is it about people who
happen to live in Soviet Socialist
Republics that have learned to fear?
I suggest that we as a country have
decided that there is only one right
way to govern a strong country, and
that's our way. And so, the politi-
cal decisions people have made within
the past seventy-five years to organ-
ize their lives collectively in ways
that differ from ours threaten us.
The successes of the USSR's govern-
ment indicate that this country may
not be the best country, only one
of the best. And this idea is not
easy for us to accept.

It is time for those of us who
believe that "live and let live"
is a constructive guide for everyday
transactions to share our conviction
with those who guide our country.
