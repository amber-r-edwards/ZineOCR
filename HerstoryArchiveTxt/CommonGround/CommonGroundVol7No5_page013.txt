COMMENTARY:

People in Limbo, the Unwanted Elderly:  
Reflections of a Senior Social Work Major  

by Barbara A. Stearns  

Something happened today that  
made me angry, sad, confused and  
left me with a feeling of utter  
helplessness, frustration, and  
hopelessness. Today was the day  
the patients on the Alternate Level  
of Care (ALC) floor in local  
hospitals cried.  

They cried because they are  
tired of not having a home or even  
space they can call their own.  
They pleaded with us to "Get me out  
of here!" and "When am I going to  
find a home? Anywhere but here."  

Allow me to tell you about these  

patients. They are primarily  
women, well over 65 years old,  
physically and/or mentally  
incapacitated, and financially  

destitute because of the HOSPITAL  
BILL. Some of these people have  
been in the hospital anywhere from  
three months to two or more years.  
If they had any savings at all when  
they entered the hospital they (the  
savings) were soon depleted and the  
patients were forced to apply for  
MEDICAID, because MEDICARE will no  
longer pay anything on the bill  
because they no longer need skilled  

nursing care.  

Once on MEDICAID the chances for  
patients to be placed in an  
appropriate Residential Health Care  
Facility (RHCF) drops to almost  
zero. The person accepted by the  
facilities is the one with at least  
$30,000 in spendable assets. To my  
colleagues and myself this is  

blatant discrimination.  
Discrimination caused by the  
Federal, State and Local  

Bureaucracies that institute and  
enforce the policies governing the  
public monies paid to Residential  
Health Care Facilities and, also,  
those agencies regulating the  
number of long term care beds that  
can exist in any given geographic  
area. These bureaucrats who tell  
us we don't need any more beds,  
that there are enough to meet  
current needs.  

That this situation exists  
terrifies me! Why? Because in a  
relatively few years I (or you)  
could be one of these people.  
People who are stripped of their  
dignity because they are considered  
hospital patients and wear hospital  
gowns all the time. Most of them  
do not have any personal items in  
their room because they only have a  
small nightstand by the bed and, if  
they are lucky, a small bulletin  
board to display cards and/or  
pictures on. A person who expected  
to return to their home within a  
short time; but now, just because  
they can no longer live alone and  
really need supervision and/or help  
24 hours per day, are stuck in the  
hospital until some RHCF,  
somewhere, decides that today is  
the day they can accept one  

MEDICAID patient. A person who is  
no longer in control of his or her  
life, possessions, and decisions  
for their own future - the future  
that is left to them.  

What SHOULD be done?  

1. We need to build more  
facilities, thereby creating  
more beds outside the hospital.  

2. The reimbursement rates paid by  
Medicaid should be increased to  
reflect the increased operating  
costs so that facilities can  
financially accept anyone.  

3. Regulate the time a bed can be  
held awaiting a private pay  
patient and impose a fine for  
exceeding that limit.  

4. Elimination of the blatant  
discrimination that exists  
against Medicaid patients by  
bringing about the above  
reforms.  

For those patients who may still  
have to remain on an ALC floor  
indefinitely every effort should be  
made to make the area as close to a  

RHCF as possible. That is:  

1. Create 3 care  

REVIEW:  

level areas,  
Domiciliary, Health Related and  
Skilled, that flow into one  

2. Allow those who are able to do  
so to wear their own clothing.  

3. Provide shelves or some type of  
space for personal mementos.  

4. Provide more on-going activities  
for those able to participate -  
one activity per day is not  
sufficient for a choice.  

5. Utilize volunteers to visit  
those with no family, to write  
letters, read to a patient,  
etc.  

What about cost, you ask?  

Yes! It will cost us money in  
increased taxes, but, unless  
something is done soon, the "Baby  
Boom" generation will find itself  
staying on an ALC floor even longer  
than their parents and/or  
grandparents did. When that  
happens, $30,000 won't even pay for  
six months care, to say nothing of  
having anything left to pay an  
RHCF.  

What can we do?  

One person working alone can  
only make a small sound, a whimper;  
but if concerned, caring people  
unite in a joint effort a very loud  
voice will be heard and create the  
first step on the long road to  
major changes that will benefit us  

A Feminist Celebration  

of Women  

Sharon Green  

Much local attention has been given  
to the work of women artists this past  

fall. The International Women  
Playwrights Conference in October was  

quickly followed, in early December, by  

"A Feminist Celebration of Women in  
Film."  

Sponsored primarily by the Graduate  
Group for Feminist Studies at U.B., as  

well as many other university and  
community groups, the festival  
presented films over a stretch of 6  
days at different locations around town, and,  
wonderfully, all were free.  

Although I was only able to view  
three of them, let me share a few  
reactions. The festival opened,  
appropriately, with “Artists &  
Animators,” which showcased the best  
work done by women artists and  
animators. Particularly revealing in  

showing how filmmakers make films, this  

film also emphasized the isolation in  
which filmmakers work. According to  

one, “My films begin in the dark, like  

a mystery."  

Second, I viewed "Sweet Sugar Rage,"  

an important film that was,  
regrettably, too long. It dealt with  
the Sisters Theatre Collective of  

Kingston, Jamaica, a group of women who  

do consciousness-raising among working-  
class women via informal theatre and  
discussion. Interviews with women workers  
illustrated their extreme physical  
labor on the sugar estates, their low  
wages, and their inevitable "double  
burden" of job and family.  
Unfortunately,  
the film's effectiveness was marred by its length, as well as  
the rapidly spoken Jamaican dialect,  
often unintelligible to Western New  
York ears.  

Finally, I saw “Reassemblage," a  
revealing film about women in Senegal.  
With only intermittent, and somewhat  
abstract, narration, this film gave  
viewers a flavor of the life of  
Senegalese women. Images of women  
pounding grain and preparing food, of  
women nursing babies, and of women  
bathing children, interspersed with  
shots of countryside and animals (both  
dead and alive), were presented in  
rapid succession. Particularly  
striking were the many close-up shots  
of women's breasts and nipples, as if  

to ridicule the Western viewer who sees  

such semi-nudity as pornographic.  
The Graduate Group for Feminist  
Studies at U.B. is to be commended for  

making this film festival so accessible  

to the Western New York community.
