Healthy Mother/  
Healthy Baby  

On February 24, 1983, Erie County  
Executive Edward J. Rutkowski will  
kick off the Healthy Mother/Healthy  
Baby Campaign. The impact of this  
campaign will hopefully reduce infant  
mortality rates in Erie County and  
improve the outcome of all pregnan-  
cies.  

In order to accomplish this goal,  
The Erie County Department of Health  
has brought together representatives  

from professional  
and government organizations  
who share the common interest and  
resources to improve prenatal and  

infant care.  

In addition to the Erie County  
Department of Health, other groups  
involved in the planning of this  
campaign include the March of Dimes,  
American Red Cross, Blue Cross and  
Blue Shield of Western New York, the  
New York State Health Department, the  
Medical Society of Erie County and  
Children's Hospital Neonatology Unit.  

Activities for this campaign will  
include:  

- Mass publicity campaign to  
promote the concepts of good prenatal  
care and the need to see a doctor as  
soon as a woman thinks she is preg-  
nant.  

- Resource directory of local  
health, social, financial, educational  
and support services available for  
pregnant women and infants.  

- Educational programs to motivate  
individuals to practice healthy  
habits (i.e. regarding sexually trans-  
missible diseases, smoking, drinking,  
drug use). Programs to be offered to  
schools and community groups. Subject  
matter will vary according to age and  
need; all will promote positive  
health habits which can and should be  
carried throughout life and especially  
during pregnancy.  

- An information exchange system  
whereby information regarding educa-  
tional programs and materials (print-  
ed and audio-visual) can be shared  
among the various organizations  
involved in this effort, thus  
avoiding the cost of duplication of  
services.  

- Hot Line Telephone Number  
(852-BABY) to refer people to the  
appropriate sources of prenatal and  
infant services available in the  
community.  

Community agencies interested in  
participating in activities to pro-  
mote Healthy Mothers Healthy Babies  
should contact the Office of Public  
Health Information and Education at  
846-7690.

A Good Gyno Exam  

by Elena Kehoe and Julia Worczak  

You should be greeted by the pro-  
vider (doctor or nurse practitioner  
or midwife) preferably before you are  
undressed and after you have emptied  
your bladder and rectum. The provi-  

der should review your chart, medical  
history, etc., with you and ask if  
there are any questions.  
An interview and medical history  

should include:  

occupation  

marital status  

educational level  

congenital and acquired diseases  

surgery  

accidents requiring treatment  

hospitalizations  

allergies  

medications being taken  

(both prescribed and over  
the counter)  

mental problems  

exposures to toxic substances  

smoking, drinking and drug use  

nutritional status  

exercise  

The gynecological history will  
include:  

onset, duration, frequency and  
amount of menstruation  

premenstrual symptoms  

sexual activity and function  
birth control methods  

vaginal infections  

venereal disease  

fertility problems  
pregnancies, types of delivery,  
abortions, miscarriages  
exposure to DES  

any other current or past  
problems  

The physical then begins, from  
head to toe if it is a yearly check  
up. The general sequence is head  
(eyes, ears, nose and throat), neck,  
lungs, heart, breast, abdomen, ex-  
tremities, and finally the pelvic  
exam. Semi-annual exams are gener-  
ally shorter, maybe only including  
heart and lung evaluation, breast and  
pelvic exam.  

As the provider is examining you,  
you should have explanations as  
necessary, although time does not  
always allow this. It is not neces-  
sary to be put in a reclining posi-  
tion until your heart is to be lis-  
tened to. And your feet need not be  
placed in the stirrups until the  
pelvic exam is to be done. This is  
a vulnerable and humiliating position  
for most women. Providers will argue  
that it saves time, but this is not  
necessarily true.  

As the pelvic exam begins and if  
you have never seen a speculum (the  
instrument used to look inside the  
vagina), do not be afraid to ask to  
see it. Relaxing at the time of  
insertion is the best thing you can  
do for yourself. When your vaginal  
muscles are tight, it must be forced  
in, which is painful. Once the spec-  
ulum is in place, the provider will  
locate your cervix. You should be  

told how it looks - pink, healthy, a  
little reddened, whatever. At this  
point, you have the right to see your  
own cervix if you wish. Most provi-  
ders will have a hand mirror avail-  
able. Do not expect the service to  
be offered, because it takes time,  
and time is money. Also, there are  
some providers who feel this is their  
territory and you have no business  
looking in. Next the smears have to  
be taken (for your pap, gonorrhea  
culture or to check for vaginitis).  
You may feel the sensation of cotton  
swabs and a wooden applicator.  

After the samples are obtained,  
you will be checked internally to  
determine the size and shape of your  
uterus, tubes and ovaries. Two fin-  
gers are inserted into the vagina  
with the other hand on the abdomen.  
The uterus, ovaries and tubes are  
felt for enlargement, lumps, tender-  
ness. Relaxing abdominal muscles at  
this point is very important. You  
should be reassured by the provider  
that everything feels normal. If  
you are a virgin, and if this is your  
first pelvic exam, let your provider  
know, so that she/he will use a  
small speculum and introduce only one  
finger into the vagina.  

Many providers will tell women  
their uterus is tipped. Ask what  
they mean by that. It is not abnor-  
mal, although usually a frightening  
term for most women. It merely means  
in which direction your uterus is  
aimed. The three positions of the  
uterus are anteverted (aimed front-  
wards), midposition (up the plane  
axis of your body), or retroverted  
(aimed to the small of your back).  
All three are normal and do not  
impede your chances of getting preg-  
nant or staying pregnant.  

You should also have a rectal exam  
done.  

You may have the following lab  
tests done:  

Complete blood count to rule  
out anemia and infection  

Pap test to screen for cervical  
cancer and infections  

Gonorrhea culture  

Urinalysis to screen for urinary  
tract infections and diabetes  

Wet smears of vaginal secretions  
if indicated by abnormal  
discharge  

Additional lab tests may be or-  
dered for any additional abnormal  
findings  

A good exam allows enough time for  
an unhurried discussion of concerns,  
procedures, and explanations. Ques-  
tions should be written down ahead of  
time so they are not forgotten. You  
may ask to have a female in the room  
with you.  

A yearly physical exam screens  
for health problems that respond  
better to treatment if detected early.  
It is also an opportunity to learn  
about your body.
