Sarah is picking dandelions.  

I watch from the kitchen window  
while packing her lunch for  
school. Dandelions already,  

so early in the spring? In the  
weeks and months to come, Sarah  
will pick dandelions for me by  
the handfuls. Later, when our  
wild strawberry patch flourishes,  
she will pick wild strawberries  
for me, too.  

I fill a small drinking glass  
and set it on the edge of the  
sink. When Sarah brings her  
dandelions into the house,  
she can place them into the water  
without interrupting my routine.  
Later there will be a small  
bowl on the sink for her  
strawberries.  

The idea for the glass and the  
bowl came about a few years ago  
when Lisa, Sarah's older sister,  
went through the dandelion and  
strawberry stage. Lisa liked the  
idea. She could drop off her  
presents, then go on her way,  
without a fuss being made by  
either of us.  

Sarah doesn't like the idea as  
well as Lisa did. She would  
prefer the fuss. If only Sarah  
could be more like Lisa.  

A few minutes later Sarah darts  
into the room. The March wind has  
ruffled her brown hair. Baby  
fine wisps fall across her fore-  
head into her big brown eyes.  

She stands before me, clutching  
three tiny dandelions in her  
chubby hands.  

I expect her to place them  
into the water glass. Instead,  
she lays the dandelions into her  
lunchbox next to her sand-  
wich and thermos. The flowers  
are for Mrs. Morrison, Sarah's  
third grade teacher.  

"Mrs. Morrison likes the pre-  
sents I bring her," Sarah ex-  
plains.  

I did notice one of Sarah's  
presents, a crayon drawing of a  
little brown-haired girl flying  
a kite, on Mrs. Morrison's desk  
when I went to see her. That  
was Friday, the day of the  
spring parent-teacher con-  
ference. That was the day  
Mrs. Morrison asked me about the  
divorce.  

"Divorce?" I asked.  
"Divorce?"  

"Aren't you and your husband  
getting a divorce?"  

"Of course not. Where did you  
get an idea like that?"  

"Sarah."  

"What..."

Directions  

Issues of Choice  
For Jewish Women  

Reported by Hope Hoetzer, E.R. Mann,  
Sharon Greer, and Janet Chassman  

Nine months in the planning, one  
day in the delivery, and the Women's  
Activities Committee of the Jewish  
Federation gave the gift of "Direc-  
tions '86" to about 400 women on  
Wednesday, March 5 at Temple Shaarey  
Zedek. “Directions ‘86: Issues of  

Choice for Jewish Women" was certain-  
ly one of the most challenging and  
fulfilling of women's events sponsored  
in Western New York in recent years.  
Over 100 volunteers participated in  
the planning and actualizing of 20  
workshops, 2 keynote speakers, a  
feminist worship service, a top-  
quality art exhibit, and two  
full sit-down meals.  

Organizers  
felt that "it  
was the right  
time to do this"  
since the last  
women's confer-  
ence had occur-  
red five years  
earlier. The  
goal was to  
“reach as many  
Jewish women as  

possible on a wide range of topics...to bring them  
together in an intellectual and Jewish  

atmosphere away from work and home." A  
key concern was planning a program  
with broad appeal, that would attract  
younger, older, working and non-working  
women. Registration was held to a mod-  
est fee for the non-profit event, day-  
care was provided, and an information  
table displayed pamphlets and books of  
interest to attendants. General Chair  
Sharon Levite noted "we wanted to touch  
as many women as we could and educate  
them. Through education comes commit-  
ment to being a woman and being Jewish  
- it is important to come together to  
share ideas, experiences and feelings -  
we become more sensitive as human beings."  

Registration was 45 minutes, which  
gave ample time to view the art exhibit  
featuring 20 excellent women artists.  
Works included oils, watercolors, col-  
lage and enamels in a wide range of  
styles. An entire article could be  
devoted solely to the display which  
was an excellent and thoughtful fea-  
ture for a time frame that is normally  
not very productive.  

Following the registration was a  
brief creative service conducted to-  
tally by women. All prayers and psalms  
carefully avoided gender-based referen-  
ces without once making the service  
seem “strange” or “unusual” for those  
of us used to traditional worship.  
Instead, it was a peaceful "bonding"  
as women's voices recited and sang  
familiar words, and the exquisite  
voice of Cantor Gail Hirschenfang  
filled the room with a strong, light  
clarity that was breathtaking. It  
is difficult to express how moving  
and right it was to hear the tradi-  
tional melodies sung in a woman's  
voice. Cantor Hirschenfang is a  
full-time Cantor at Temple Beth Zion  
and is one of the few vested women  
cantors in the country.  

Workshops included “Eye of the  
Storm: Teaching Your Children to  
Deal with Prejudice"; "Jewish by  
Choice"; "Can a Feminist be a Nice  
Jewish Girl?"; "Jewish Women Write  
On" (which included CG contributor  
Ruth Geller); “Women's Anger: Friend  
or Foe"; “Danger From the Right -  
Threats to Your Soaps"; "Making  
Jewish Memories: Jewish Values for  
Jewish Children"; "Women's Health  
Issues: Learning to Take Care of  
Ourselves the Way We Take Care of  
Others"; "Raising Children In Isra-  
el vs. the United States"; "Music  
of the Jewish Soul"; "Women and Mo-  
ney: Investment Strategies for the  
Future"; "Cultural Roots and Psycho-  
therapy"; and “Women and Money: Tax  
Shelters for 1986."  

CG owes many thanks to the "Direc-  
tions '86" organizers who allowed us  
to fly in and out all day as we tried  
to maximize our coverage of a plenti-  
tude of attractive workshops by col-  
lective effort. On a personal note,  
when we reporters registered in the  
morning, a warm and friendly woman  
commented "I'm having a mid-life crisis -  
I really admire that you keep busy.”
