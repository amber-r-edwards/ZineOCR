Rain pouring down outside and in

(rustic cabin bathrooms); no heat on
the chilliest third weekend in Sept-
ember that I can remember; few mirrors
and those that exist small, scratched,

clouded; one lav to eight

awful doesn't it?

33 women who took part in the

Women’s

Weekend at

camp, it was wonderful and
physical comforts were insignificant
factors in the greater scheme of
bringing together this heterogeneous
group of women in an exchange of
ideas, feelings, and experience.

They ranged in age from the 78-

year-old Dorothy to the 26-year-old
Sharon, in personality from the
gregarious Marilyn to the quiet
Esther.

It was said to me, on the second
day, that we all came for different
reasons. I have to disagree. We
came for the same reason. We each
wanted to do something for ourselves,
so we gave ourselves a weekend away
from "it" all. But we gave it to
ourselves in 33 very individual ways.
Some found it in new friendships,
born from a common love of song and
realized around an evening campfire.
Some found it in a card game, or at
a craft table, or in the bonding of
a Sunday morning service. Others,
like myself, found it in long walks

on the beach, an opportunity to
replenish the self with the sound of
gulls and waves, and the feel of
sand and wind.

Women's Weekend offered something
for every taste: yoga; a nature walk
in the woods supervised by Ellen
Freeland; workshops on color and
make-up with Nancy Longwith; on self-
esteem with Linda Cooley; and a talk

NEWS,

A new group for women which calls
itself "a more conservative counter-
part to the radicals in the National
Organization for Women," are attempting
to challenge the feminist movement.
"Concerned Women for America" states
that they are worried that anti-Chris-
tian and feminist influences were
undermining moral standards and the
home.

Some points for their platform in
clude:

-Opposition to the ERA which would
eliminate the "common-sense distinc-
tions between the 2 sexes" and create
a "genderless society."

-Opposition to laws granting protection
to homosexual lifestyles, particularly
for teachers in schools and day-care
centers.

-A strong national defense.

-Support for school prayer and the
establishment of Christian schools
without state interference.
-Opposition to abortion.

Leaders of the group are starting
to speak out, not with the "hostile,
radical militant attitude," but with
a "more loving and tender spirit..."

It offered an opportunity

in this

But mostly it was an opportunity to
give yourself 48 hours to respond
only to you. There were no obli-
gations to fulfill, no cooking, no
cleaning, no demands from others.

Nor was there a social obligation
to the group. What was given was
given freely, and what was withheld
was not resented. Each understood

that this was a time to do exactly
what one pleased - perhaps the most
important criteria for making the
weekend a success for the individual.
Of course it was wonderful
to sit down to three meals a day,
each more delicious than the last,
and not to have to even think about
the dishes after. We all re-dis-
covered the fact that food tastes
so much better when seasoned by a

hand other than your own. And we
showed our appreciation by "Hoover-
ing" down quantities we would never
manage at home. It was wonderful
not to answer a phone (although I
did hear one ring once), not to
clean anything other than one's own
teeth, and not to have to nurture

a soul, unless we really felt moved
to do so.

Our leaders from the Y, Charlotte
Moss and Margaret Cardina, hope to
make Women's Weekend at Cradle Beach
Camp an annual event. Next Sept-
ember think about giving yourself
a weekend away from it all. You
can have it any way you like.

ADDENDUM:
sponsored by the Downtown YWCA,
Franklin St, Buffalo. It is an
annual event, held every September.

The Women's Weekend is

The National Coalition of American
Nuns has issued a statement saying
that the group disagrees with the
National Conference of Catholic Bish-
ops on the topic of abortion and that
they reject the idea “that to be pro-
choice is to be pro-abortion."

The Chicago-based nuns’ group accu-
sed the bishops of sexism for thinking
that "they alone have the right and
wisdom to make decisions about the
morality of a woman's existential
choice when that choice differs from
their theoretical one."

The statement issued said that the
abortion topic has been "politicized
and given simplistic treatment" and
it also asked why there has not been
“equal concern for those already
born, for abused and abandoned chil-
dren, for the homeless and hungry and
for the pauperization of women and
children."

Stricter rules, including one that
has contestants swear that they have
always been female, are being issued
by the Miss America Pageant Committee.
The revisions, which a pageant spokes-
man termed as “very general" will be
reflected in a contract signed by
contestants in all pageants from the
traditional down to local levels.
