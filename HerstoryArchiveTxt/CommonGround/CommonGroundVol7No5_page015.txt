HELP. COMMON GROUND

Save Those Tapes!

REMINDER:

Here's a simple way that you can help Common Ground: save your cash register tapes from Tops, Bells, and Super Duper. Common Ground, as a non-profit organization, receives money.

Simply save your tapes and mail them to us, give them to a collective member, or deposit them in our box at EMMA bookstore. If you wish to use any coupons on the backs of receipts, just give us the bottom portion, showing the total amount.

Our task of sorting and adding up the receipts is greatly simplified if you sort your tapes by store and then paper clip each type of store together.

HINT: SEND TAPES WHEN YOU HAVE A LARGE NUMBER SAVED!
