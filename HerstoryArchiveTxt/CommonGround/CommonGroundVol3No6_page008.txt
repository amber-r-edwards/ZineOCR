PPPOE OP OSE OOO SS

by Sharon Green

Last month, Potpourri discussed  
“activist work anyone can do.”  
But there was too much of that  
for just one column...so we con-  
tinue here. ~

Whatever small “activist”  
steps we may take can have far  
reaching implications. I'd like  
to relate a true story that may  
give readers motivation and  
inspiration to go out and effect  
some change themselves.

Those of you who have been  
readers of my writing in CS may  
remember that when my daughter,  
Ellen, was born last year at  
home, a good friend of mine,  
Becky, was present throughout my  
labor. She inspired me with the  
spirit and stamina I needed to  
deliver her godchild into the  
world, and I will always be in-  
debted to her for that.

Somewhere in Africa, some  
Ethiopians are, unknowingly,  
indebted to her also. The morn-  
ing after viewing an incredibly  
telling piece on "60 Minutes"—  
much more vivid and anguished  
than what we had all seen on the  
news up to that point—Becky and  
I talked on the phone. She told  
me how she cried on and off for  
the rest of the evening, espe-  
cially whenever she looked at  
her two healthy children. She was  

to action and she asked me  
what I thought about her approach-  
ing the pastor of her parish to  
ask him if she could speak briefly  
at each Mass that weekend to try  
to inspire the congregation to  
donate money for the victims of  
the Ethiopian famine.

I, too, am Catholic, and my  
gut reaction was that she'd have  
as much chance as a snowball in  
hell. Images of the patriarchal  
church, with stodgy old pastors  
set in their ways, came to mind.  
I had seen occasional guest mis-  
sionaries give such talks at Mass,  
but never a lay person, and never  
a woman. However, I said none of  
this to her. Knowing her courage  
and spunk, I encouraged her to  
make an appointment to see the  
priest.

Two days later she called to  
say the priest had given his  
permission for her to speak at  
all six Masses that weekend.

As I sat later and listened to  
her tell the congregation how  
the footage of the Ethiopian  
babies who couldn't even cry  
because all their energy was  
needed to simply survive had  
moved her to ask if this con-  
gregation would dig deeply into  
their pockets, I was proud of  
her and moved to tears.

In less than 24 hours, she  
drove back and forth six times  
to give that talk, between  
nursing the baby and all the  
other jobs she does at home.

Yet it was worthwhile; a sub-  
stantial amount of money was  
donated. If she can do some-  
thing this admirable, surely we  
can all find small ways to act  
on our convictions in 1985.

Here are more suggestions  
for some belated New Year's  
Resolutions:

PARTICIPATE IN SURVEYS

This is a wonderful oppor-  
tunity to state your opinion  
to those who are eager to hear  
it. Consumer surveys in shop-  
ping malls or mail surveys on  
consumer items represent such  
mainstream products and phil-  
osophies that you'll be able to  
lot of sexism. “During  
elections, respond to telephone  
surveys in a way that states —  
clearly your political views.

you  
CAN  
HELP

VOLUNTEER YOUR TIME

For those of us with full-  
time jobs, with children to  
care for, or both, time is at  
a real premium. But instead of  
joining an organization and making  
a regular time commitment you  
can offer to donate only occasion-  
al time. For example, because  
I am a supporter of public TV,  
but am unable to donate much  
money, I usually volunteer a few  
hours to answer the phone each  
June for Channel 17's TV auction.  
It's only once a year, but I feel  
like I've done something in re-  
turn for the near-daily "Sesame  
Street" watched at my house. I  
usually make the effort to buy  
something from the auction as  
well.

CORRESPOND WITH A WOMAN IN PRISON  
This is a more specific sug-  
gestion than the rest, yet it  
could be one that is rewarding  
to both you and a woman inmate.  
Women in prison are forgotten  
by most of us, and they often  
lead lonely, desolate lives,  
often apart from their children.  
Many women are in prison for  
relatively small and non-violent  
crimes, and it may be educational  
to find out how much we have in  
common with them.

SELECT CAREFULLY WHERE TO DO  
BUSINESS.

If you choose not to do busi-  
ness at a certain place, be  
sure to let them know why, pre-  
ferably in writing, but at least  
by phone. Communicate with mana-  
gers and owners, rather than  
salespeople, who are basically  
powerless to change things.

When I recently read that a  
former polygraph examiner for  
Mesmer's Dairy had sexually  
abused female employees while  
administering the exam, I de-  
cided to boycott Mesmer's until  
they abolished this required lie  
detector testing for their em-  
ployees. I wrote to their head-  
quarters on Grand Island telling  
them this. Avoiding Mesmer's  
good milk prices will be hard  
for me, since I buy 4 or 5 half-  
gallons a week, but I'll stick  
to my decision. The Nestle  
boycott is officially over, but  
my anger over their methods of  
pushing their infant formula on  
third world mothers who were  
illiterate or had no access to  
sterile water still prevents me  
from buying their products.

VOTE...

always, even in primaries,  
and try to be informed enough  
to vote for all offices, not  
just those with well-known  
candidates. Remind your friends  
and acquaintances to do the same.

DONATE MONEY...

even small amounts, to causes  
and organizations that are espe-  
cially important to you. Occa-  
sionally, I'll donate as little  
as $5, or even $2. Most contri-  
butions are tax-deductible.

BE SELECTIVE WITH YOUR CAST-OFFS  
When you discard material  
items, donate them to a variety  
of places. Most of us tend to  
give things to the Goodwill or  
the Salvation Army, because they  
are well-known and have a con-  

venient collection system.  
However, many struggling  
groups run garage sales and the  
like to raise money. I donate  
some of my family's discarded  
items to the All-People’s Con-  
gress for use in their annual  
rummage sale. Often these or-  
ganizations are also willing  
to pick up items, so all you  
have to do is give them a call.

ACTIVISM: HOW

SUPPORT ORGANIZED BOYCOTTS

Often you can learn more  
about these by getting mailings  
from organizations of your choice  
or even occasionally by reading  
publications that are less "main-  
stream" than Time, Newsweek,  
etc. You can initiate your own  
boycott if something has really  
angered you, but it is always  
important to write the company  
to tell them what you are doing  
and why. For instance, last  
year, I read that a local Per-  
kin's restaurant ejected a  
nursing woman and her family in  
mid-meal. Because I am a former  
nursing mother, I have not gone  
to Perkin's since then, and I  
ask others to do the same. I  
wrote to both the corporate  
offices and to that individual  
Perkin's restaurant telling  
them of my action.

Whatever kind of action you  
resolve to take in 1985, it  
may be more significant than  
you realize. I believe we can-  
not merely sit around and bemoan  
the state of our nation. We  
must act...in whatever capacity  
our finances and schedules per-  
mit, but, as you see by these  
suggestions, we need not let  
these limitations be an excuse.

WOMEN

ARTISTS

by Margit S

For many years, I have been  
"nudging" our cultural institu-  
tions, The Buffalo Philharmonic,  
Albright-Knox, Studio Arena, to  
be cognizant of the contributions  
of women, their talents and the  
fact that the audiences and fund-  
raisers of all are composed of  
at least half women. Then, as  
any one of them did feature women  
artists, performers, etc., I wrote  
letters of thanks and promised  
them that their efforts would be  
remembered at annual contribution  
time. Over the years, the Albright  
Knox in particular has become  
noticeably more open to women ar-  
tists, and often features women  
in their newsletter and points  
up new acquisitions by women ar-  
tists; there seems also to be  
more employment of women as cur-  
ators, etc.

One "nut" that has remained  
hard to crack is the Buffalo Phil-  
harmonic. Annually I would write  
to the music director and execu-  
tive director, suggesting that  
women guest conductors be added  

to the annual concert season. I  

never received any reply at all,  
until the arrival of Gary Good,  
the present executive director.  
We have carried on a correspon-  
dence for the last couple of  
years, and I think there may be  
some movement: a  
This year, on March 8 and  
9, there will be 2 woman guest  

conductors. She is Kathrine Cou-  
met, of the Baltimore Philharmon-  
ic. I would encourage everyone,  
classical music fan or not, to  
pick one of these dates, go to  
the box office and get your tick-  
ets.

The second part of my message  
is to urge others of you also to  
write the Philharmonic, Albright-  
Knox and other organizations and  
lobby for attention to women's  
work in the fine and performing  
arts. The talents of half our  
population must be recognized,  
and the women leaders must be  
seen and become available as  
models for our talented children  
and youth.

FRAGILE  
MOMENT

by Rene Radecki

Babies turn into kids, kids  
into teenagers, and teens into  
adults. The process of growing  
up has been around as long as  
life itself. For some it's a  
slow continuous change; for  
others a single moment in time  
can alter a life and thrust one  
headlong into maturity whether  
they are ready for it or not.  
Growing up for me came suddenly  
and extremely harshly. It was  
January of 1967, I was eighteen  
years old. My beautiful 5 month  
old baby boy was dying and there  
was very little that I could do  
to help him.

The winter was hard that year;  

times were tough, money was scarce.  
My husband and I were just two  

kids trying to make it with a  

baby of our own. My son Bobby  

had what seemed like an ordinary  
cold. But it hung on and the  
cough got worse and so I finally  

called our doctor. I had been  
monitoring Bobby’s temperature  
and respiration for days and had  

done everything I could. Knowing  
this, the doctor had me come into  
the office immediately even though  
it was Sunday. After checking  
him over thoroughly, the doctor  
decided to hospitalize him.

A feeling of terror crept over  
me as I walked into the hospital  
to my breast.  

He could not be that sick, he had a bad  
cold. The doctor had followed  
us there. He had to practically  
pry Bobby out of my arms so that  
the nurses could get him into  

an oxygen tent to help his  
breathing. He then very gently  

said that Bobby had tracheal bronchitis and  
was in serious condition. My  

body could not comprehend all  

that was happening; first I  
fainted, then I got sick. The  
doctor finally gave me a seda-  
tive and told my husband to  

take me home. He explained that  
they would be testing Bobby  
extensively and that I wouldn't  

be allowed to stay with him any-  
way. I was forced to leave.

The next several days seemed  
like one continuous nightmare.  

So many needles going into that  
little body. When they ran out  
of room on his little bottom,  
they began giving injections into  
his thighs. His cry soon became  
a whimper. On the third day I  
got the call that every mother  
dreads: my child had taken a  
turn for the worse. His condi-  
tion was critical. I was told to  
come to the hospital quickly  
since he might not make it. When  
I got to his room, he looked so  
pale and weak. I tried so hard  
to transmit all of my love and  
strength to my tiny son. I kept  
telling him to hang on and to  
fight. One hour passed, then two,  
then three. The nurses told me  
that each passing hour was a good  
sign. After several hours and  
some more tests, the doctor cau-  
tiously told me that he felt that  
Bobby had passed the critical  
stage. He would live, barring  
any further complications. Need-  
less to say his father and I were  
ecstatic. I felt as if I had  
been given a second chance at  
motherhood, and at life itself.

I had walked into the hospital a  
child carrying a child. When I  
brought him home two weeks later,  
I was a woman planning a future  
for a very special son.

Bobby is grown now, soon to be  
on his own. I can no longer pro-  
tect him and he must find his  
own way in the world. Soon he  
will make his transition from child  
to man. I hope his journey into  
adulthood is easier than mine.  
When I look at his blond hair, I  
still see the tiny baby in the  
huge oxygen tent. I see the girl  
I was and the woman I became and  
I think of that moment in time  
when I learned how precious and  
fragile life really is. I am  
grateful for the second chance I  
was given.
