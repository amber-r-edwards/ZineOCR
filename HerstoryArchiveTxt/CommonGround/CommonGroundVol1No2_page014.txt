Community Speak-Out _ » ss2:0» e-cepesnse

QUESTION:

"How does your religion (or the religion you grew
up with) view women? Do women have any function

in your religion today?"

Sharon Jeffries, Depew:

"I'm Christian, and in the church
that I go to, women don't give ser-
mons or hand out communion. But
they are very much actively involved
in church activities, for example,
social gatherings, handling food
preparation, decorations and organ-
izing meetings. If a woman has a
viewpoint to be presented to the
church, she would go through the
deacons and the elders. But the
women's viewpoints are not over-
looked. I feel that women seem to
be comfortable with their role in
the church; I am. There really
doesn't seem to be any discrimi-
nation that could incriminate any
woman."

Linda Chattin, Clarence:

"I'm a Lutheran and as far as
our church goes, the role of women
and men is split down the middle.
For example, women read the les-
sons. Also, there are 7:30 a.m.
services in the summer which are
primarily run by women. The women
often do the sermons. At this
service, if husbands come, they
hand out the bulletins."

Anonymous, Buffalo:

"I'm a Christian, and women and
men are equal inheritors of the
kingdom of God. Both are equally
responsible for their actions.

They both receive the same benefits
and blessings. In the home, they
are both responsible for raising
children, but have separate roles."

Anonymous, Buffalo:

"Women are definitely seen
upon in a different light. Born-
again Christians say that women are
different because they were made
from Adam's rib. Moslems look at
women differently, and they have a
set role that they are supposed to
fill. Moslems back it with their
holy literature."

Brenda O'Neal, Buffalo:

"I used to play a role in the
Baptist church, but I'm not active
in it now. I do believe in God in
my heart. But a person doesn't
have to go to church to practice
their beliefs. In my church, men
dominated things and the women
sang in choirs, ushered, that is,
the things that women 'should' do.
They thought that women should be
in their 'place.' Decisions are
made by deacons, who are always
men."

Karin Lowenthal, Buffalo:

"I was brought up as a cultural
Jew, which meant that in my house-
hold we weren't religious. But we
learned to respect Jewish history
and to be proud of being Jewish.
So I was never affected negatively
in that I never had trouble coming
out as a lesbian. My spirituality
is based on my belief in women as
powerful beings and my faith in the
feminist and lesbian communities.
I draw my energies from these."

Kathleen Gaines, Niagara Falls:
"Religion is a very important
part of my life. I'm a Christian
(Presbyterian). In the Presby-
terian religion, women generally
have higher roles than other re-
ligions. Ours is one of the first
religions to have women ministers.
Biblically, women are viewed as
being equal to men."

Kathy McCune, Buffalo:

"I was brought up strict Irish
Roman Catholic, and it imposed on
me a very deep sense of guilt.
Confession sticks out in my mind
the most as being totally traumatic.
Catholicism affects women's sexu-
ality in that they can't always
enjoy it. I saw this in my mother,
because Catholicism ruined any
possible sexual feeling she had."

Anonymous, Buffalo:

"First of all, I'm Moslem.
There aren't any specific rules for
women in my religion. I'm from
Iran, and after the revolution,
everything changed. Before that,
women who were very religious
couldn't work or study. But
after the revolution, we found that
this had been the wrong interpre-
tation of the Koran. We know now
that women can do whatever men can
do. In Iran, women have to wear
certain clothing, but in terms of
jobs, women and men are pretty
much the same."

NEWS Review

by Sharon Przepasniak

This belief is something from which
girls, unlike boys, are never weaned.
Most destructive of all, it keeps a-
live in women a sense of inferiori-
ty.

A Commentary on
The Cinderella Complex
by Colette Dowling (summit, 1981)

On August 16, 1982, 41 new re-
cruits were sworn in by the Buffalo
Police Department. This class was
not only the second largest in the
department's history, but it was
also noteworthy because 19 of these
new police officers - nearly half -
were women.

Several of these women are follo-
wing in their fathers' footsteps.
Retired Capt. Joseph Vincenzo,
whose daughter Josephine Hodge is
joining the department, feels that
women are a valuable asset to the
police force. He was quoted in the
Buffalo Evening News as saying that
female officers might be able to
better handle the rise in crime
among women and youth.

For the next few months, these
recruits will participate in a
training program, and hopefully,
will receive a permanent appoint-
ment to the department later this
year. Common Ground wishes the
best to these new women police
recruits.

"In their heart of hearts, most
women don't believe they are really
capable" (of assuming final resp-
onsibility for themselves.)

The Cinderella Complex will ring
a bell with any woman who has ever
sabotaged herself, or felt afraid
of excelling or standing apart from
the crowd.

by Elizabeth Linz Martino

In the mid-seventies, Colette Dow-
ling made a shocking discovery: "I
found that what I really wanted was to
be taken care of. It was not just a
question of having someone else pay
the bills. I wanted full-time emo-
tional protection, a buffer between
me and the world." Her theory comes
from four years of research, inter-
viewing women and the professionals
who study women.

Ms. Dowling says: "It is the the-
sis of this book that personal psy-
chological dependency - the deep wish
to be taken care of by others - is the
chief force holding women down today.
I call this the 'Cinderella Com-
plex': a network of distorted atti-
tudes and fears that keeps women in
a kind of half-light, retreating from
the full use of their minds and crea-
tivity. Like Cinderella, women to-
day are still waiting for something
external to transform their lives.
