Are you one of the many people in  
the "mushy middle" of the abortion  
debate? I am. Do you intellectually  
support a woman's right to a safe  
and legal abortion, yet shudder at  
the thought of the actual abortion  
process? I do. And are you over-  
whelmed at the increasing number of  
abortions in the U.S., and especially  
New York State? I am. And do you  
ever wonder how a woman deals with  
her grief after an abortion? I do.  
"For a long time now, I've avoided  
writing about abortion, since my own  
feelings are somewhat ambiguous.  
Also, abortion is such an emotionally  
charged issue that it can pit the  
best of feminists against each other.

However, because of the recent  
backlash against the right of women  
to abortion (evidenced most dramatic-  
ally by repeated bombings of abortion  
clinics), because of President Rea-  
gan's well-publicized support of the  
pro-life (that is, anti-abortion)  
movement (not to mention his poten—

Justices who agree with him), because  
of the alarming return to a more con-  
servative (read, "oppressive to  
women") climate, and because of the  
widespread showing of the sensation-  
alized film The Silent Scream (which  
depicts, via sonography, a first tri-  
mester fetus being aborted, and  
which claims that said fetus feels  
pain), I feel compelled to share  
my views on abortion.

Despite my Catholic upbringing,  
seeing a good number of girls in  
college get pregnant made me realize  
that abortion must be an option.  
After all, these girls were young;  
they were usually too afraid to let  
their parents know of their pregnancy;  
they had to complete college; and  
they lacked a husband or often even  
a committed lover. Some weren't  
even sure who the father was.

Clearly, none were able to pro-  
vide a child with a stable environ-  
ment, and not all were emotionally  
prepared for the enormous responsi-  
bility of raising a child.

And I shared a quality with  
these girls. Even though I was one  
of the lucky ones, I always knew  
that I'd consider abortion if I be-  
came pregnant before marriage. We  
did not let ourselves really con-  
ceptualize the idea of actually  
having an infant, a child...or if  
we did we never admitted it. Rather  
we focused only on ourselves and  

our obvious unreadiness to become  
mothers, single mothers at that.

Instead, our concerns were secrecy,  
money, and safety! Before the Sup-  
reme Court legalized abortions in  
1973, knitting needles, coat hangers,  
a deliberate tumble down the stairs,

The Abortion Issue:  
In the Middle

or abortionists who charged exorbitant  
prices without always guaranteeing  
safe and sanitary techniques were  

our options.

Despite this, many girls had no  
choice but to abort. And the deci-  
sion was usually easier than the  
process itself. Even though the  
abortions were sometimes grueling  
and the physical recuperation diffi-  
cult, a few days of misery was more  
neatly hidden and less life-disrup-  
ting than a nine-month pregnancy.

Fifteen years ago, I supported  
friends through this, but other than  
close friends, most girls had nowhere  
to turn for help. Did they grieve?  
How can a woman not grieve after  
an abortion, not cry at some point  

The Crisis Point  

Deciding to have a baby or an  
abortion is always serious. For  
some women, this decision is more  
clear than for others who experience  
a great deal of ambivalent emotions.

The abortion decision involves intrinsic  
values. These values include a  
woman's life, her life plan and the  
value of the fetus. A woman needs  
to make the most responsible and  
moral choice for herself and the  
other significant persons in her  
life. The final decision is made in  
relation to her own needs, resources,  
beliefs and hopes.

A woman fears she is pregnant due  
to a missed menstrual period. She  
confirms her suspicion with a posi-  
tive pregnancy test. The real cri-  
sis of a woman's unwanted pregnancy  
is the actual decision-making pro-  
cess. "Crisis" can be defined as a  
turning point for better or for  
worse. The first and most basic step  
in this decision is deciding to de-  
cide at all. The woman who declines  
to choose is actually making a con-  
crete decision because the pregnancy,  
if not disturbed, will further devel-  
op in gestation so that no choice  
can legally be made. A woman who is  
able to face an unwanted pregnancy,  
however, must make a choice for her  
future. In 1985, a woman experienc-  
ing an unwanted pregnancy has alter-  
natives: keeping the child, putting  
the child up for adoption, and legal-  
ly terminating the pregnancy! The  
fourth alternative not often spoken  
about is suicide. Usually a preg-  
nancy is concealed or denied with  
suicide; notes are not left and the  
victim has not shared her emotional  
pain of the unwanted pregnancy nor  
her plan to end the pain by suicide.  
A desperate woman may be willing to  
take the risk of her own life with  

pregnancy whether it is  

choice  

afterward? But because abortions  
are often concealed, women have few,  
if any, shoulders to cry on.

And even today, despite legalized  
abortions, few clinics or private  
doctors routinely recommend coun-  
seling or other services to help  
women through the emotional pain that  
follows. Often only if a woman calls  
back later to request help is she  
referred to counseling. But in many  
areas, only private counseling is  
available, and how many women can  
afford that? [See notes at end of  
article for counseling services in  
this area]

I'd like to see more of the pro-  
choice people address this issue.

a self-induced abortion.

The woman should talk her situa-  
tion over with someone she can trust  
and who she knows will support what-  
ever she decides. Clinics where  
her to clergy or counselors who will  
not attempt to decide for her, but  
help bring questions to her mind  
that only she can answer for herself.  
These people should be ready to  
help her and support her with her  
decision. This type of legitimate  
pregnancy counseling is distinguished  
from so-called "pregnancy-crisis  
services" which are generally asso-  
ciated with the right-to-life move-  
ment, whose true purpose is to dis-  
courage women with unwanted preg-  
nancies from considering all of  
their options. Because of the in-  
tense feelings associated with an  
unwanted pregnancy decision, many  
people may try to make the decision  
for the woman. The decision is hers  
and she should hold onto that right  
to decide. If the woman feels she  
is being pressured, she should look  
somewhere else for help.

Throughout the decision-making  
process, remember that deciding for  
abortion or for continuing the preg-  
nancy full-term does not put a woman  
into a world of good or evil. What-  
ever she decides, the woman will be  
left with some qualms and some uncer-  
tainties. These feelings cannot  
be avoided as they may be considered  
a part of the human condition. A  
woman should do her very best in  
making such a momentous decision and  
then find the strength to go on know-  
ing that she has done her best.

This article was written by two women  
who work in a local clinic that per-  
forms abortions. One is the counsel-  
ing supervisor there and the other  

is an L.P.N. who counsels 1st and  

2nd trimester patients.
