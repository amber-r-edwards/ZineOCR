WomenSpeak, a half hour weekly radio  
program sponsored by U.B.'s Women's  
Studies, presents contemporary national  
and local issues of interest to women  
and the WBFO listening audience.  

The program explores issues that  

affect women and their lives. Women  
are given little opportunity to speak  
in today's world, and more importantly  
to be listened to. Women are exposed  

continuously to interpretation of  

their lives. Their problems and ex-  

periences that are uniquely their own,  
and understood by other women, often  
receive misinterpretation from sources  
other than their own voices. To give  
a balanced view of women's lives to  

a listening audience, WomenSpeak will  
give an in-depth view of a single  
issue during each program. The pro-  
gram will be a magazine style format.  
The discussion may be literary, dra-  
matic, musical, analytical, sociolo-  
gical, historical or a combination  

of these. The program is aired on  
alternating Sundays, at 4:30 pm on  

FM 88. See our calendar for details.
