Reviewed by Deborah Jop

For those who enjoy reading but  
have neither the time nor energy  
to devote to long, intense novels,  
J. California Cooper's new book may  
be just right for you. "A Piece of  
Mine" is a compilation of her short  
stories about women - women who are  
black, women who are poor, and women  
who grow old before their time. Many  
of them are physically abused,  
cheated on, ignored, or trivialized  
by their men. Sound depressing?  
Oddly enough, it's not. These  
short stories are filled with warmth,  
humor and sensitive depictions of  
soul-sustaining friendships.

Cooper writes in a simple,  
folksy down-to-earth style that is  
charming and at the same time, very  
real and true to life. The char-  
acters, though often “victims" (of  
either men or society in general)  
always have an inner awareness of  
their circumstances, and a strength  
and determination that drives them  
to some sort of action. Whether  
by leaving a cruel husband, or  
dressing up and attending funeral  
services to find a new one, they  
all resist being victims of fate.

Each of the stories in the book  
has a unique plot that is made even  
more interesting by the women  

very restrictive situation in On-  

tario. The noted Canadian physi-  
cian, Dr. Robert Morgentaler is  
seen performing an abortion. As  
we view his gentle, yet profession-  
al manner, we are struck by the  
fact that he has repeatedly been  
prosecuted for trying to establish  
an abortion clinic in Toronto.

Up to this point in the film,  
the momentum has been building.  
The injustice of the denial of le-  
gal abortion facilities has been  
made clear. So it is with outrage  
that we view the final segment  
filmed in Colombia where abortions  
are available on the black market.  
We see desperately poor women, hos-  
pitalized and dying from illegal  
abortions. One woman has tried to  
abort herself with an onion, and  
her tale of desperation, poverty  
and victimization makes it abun-  
dantly clear why Colombia's death  
rate from abortion is the highest  
in the world. That stark, squalid  
hospital in which she rests is an  
image that one will not soon forget!

Sponsored by the National Film  
Board of Canada and produced entire-  
ly by women, this film is a power-  
ful testament to the truth of women's  
experience. In contrast to such  
blatant propaganda devices as "The  
Silent Scream" it speaks movingly  
of the need for humane treatment  
of women... starting with the  
control of their own bodies.

THE ART

Cooper has created to give it life.  
She draws you into her stories so  
successfully that the characters  
have a habit of staying with the  
reader long after putting down the  
book. I found myself thinking  
about these captivating people and  
their lives for hours.

My only regret was the length of  
the book - only 120 pages, which  
raced by much too rapidly!

Review by E.R. Mann

Those of you who were in atten-  
dance at Common Ground's Perform-  
ance Night, April 20, were treated  
to a surprise guest performance by  
Judith Kerman, founder of Earth's  
Daughters, a local feminist literary  
collective and one of the oldest in  
the country. Kerman read that night  
from her new chapbook of poetry,  
Driving for Yellow Cab.

These eight poems are about de-  
fining one's own environment, making  
a home out of where you are. In  
this volume, “where you are” is  
often a car--traveling long distances  
or going round and round town, going  
nowhere, driving cab.

The poems are very definite.

They are crisp, clear insights, and  
honest ones, as in this poem,  
“Packing to Move”;

Like my skin: grown into, it remains  
to peel it off is painful

boxes, boxes, empty chairs

dust coming out of hiding places

the light through this west window

is homecoming

shed it

find a new light

living nowhere, suspended over Main St  
in a car full of books and kitchenware

Driving for Yellow Cab is available  
from Tout Press, 420 East College  

Street, Kent, Ohio 44240.

Resources-Coming to Terms: Lesbian  
and Gay Health. An annotated biblio-  

graphy for consumers and health care  
providers by E.L. Diamond and M.E.  
Manning. Published by Health Sciences  
Library, State University of New York  
at Buffalo. 1985.

There is a new eclectic bibliography  
of books, periodicals, articles and  
a filmstrip or two, concentrating on  
lesbian and gay health concerns.

The editors' goals are to "reach,  
first, an audience of lesbians and  
gay men in order to demonstrate that  
acceptable health care is a reason-  
able and possible goal. Secondly,  

we want to reach an audience of health  
care professionals to sensitize  

them to potential biases and help  

them recognize the urgent need to  
integrate high-quality gay health  
services into the mainstream of health  
care delivery."

There are 32 resource listings  
which a lay person can use to find  
more information for her/himself, to  
use to take to a health care provider  
as a reference, or to get that  
therapist/doctor or other professional  
thinking about the issues. Health  
care providers can use this as a  
guide for gay or lesbian clients or  
patients when they need more infor-  
mation or support to properly treat  
them.
