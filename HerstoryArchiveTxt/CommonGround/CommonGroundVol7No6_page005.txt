‘THEATRE NOTES

by S.M. Beck

Tom Foolery

"Tomfoolery," the words, music
and lyrics of Tom Lehrer will be at
Rochester's GeVa Theatre through
February 5. For those unfamiliar
with Lehrer's work, this now almost
semi-mild mannered professor has
managed to offend almost everyone
in his collection of songs. If you
remember David Frost's T.V. show,
"That Was The Week That Was," you
may even recognize some of his work.
Songs include Poisoning the Pigeons
in the Park, I Got It From Agnes
(a nifty little ditty about V.D.),
The Masochism Tango, The Vatican
Rag, and one of the greatest college
songs—Fight Fiercely, Harvard.

The cast of Stephen Kane, John-
Charles Kelly, Mark McGrath and

Laura Turnbull do a great job, and
don't miss a single innuendo in the
wicked satire. They had the audience
rolling: Well worth the trip to
Rochester. For info call 1-232-1366.

The Boy Friend

"The Boyfriend" by Sandy Wilson
is Studio Arena Theatre's current
money making effort. Due to a loss
in funding, the powers that be pro-
duced a happy musical that has been
around since 1953 that should be a
box office success. With a large
cast and lots of boop-boop-a-doops
and do-wacka-dos, it follows the
young ladies of Mme. Dubonnet's
French finishing school through a
day's romantic travails to perfect
happiness in a novel "play-within-
a-play" format. If you enjoy the
musical romances of the 1930's,
you'll probably enjoy this also.

So it's not intellectually challeng-
ing, and some of the singers could
stand voice lessons—it does have
some cute moments and you don't
have to think to watch it. It

will be onstage through February
18. Contact the Studio Arena box
office at 856-5650 for info.

The Importance
of Being Earnest

"The Importance of Being Earnest"
is surely one of Oscar Wilde's most
enduring and beloved comedies.
Wilde's wit runs rampant through
this fast paced romantic farce.
Starring Chris O'Neill as Jack,
David Lamb as Algernon, Michael
Harris as Dr. Chasuble, Steven
Cooper playing two roles as Lane
and Merriman, John Buscaglia as
Lady Bracknell (yes, you read that
right!), Monica Martin as Gwendolyn,
Eileen Dugan as Cecily, and Anne
Gayley as Miss Prism, it is sche-
duled to run February 16 to March
19 at the Kavinoky Theatre. I'm
told that it will be "a little
different," and that the director,
Ray Yeates, has been imported from

Walk in the Woods

"A Walk in the Woods" by Lee
Blessing...join two diplomats as
they walk through the tangles of
world peace. You'll witness a
remarkable relationship that goes
beyond international boundaries
according to Rochester's GeVa
Theatre. With GeVa's record of
consistently producing stimulating
high quality pieces, it promises
to be another exceptional theatre
experience. For info, contact
