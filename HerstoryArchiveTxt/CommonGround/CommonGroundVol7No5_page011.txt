“Analysis of

Women in the Civil Rights Movement

passive.

Yet, in retrospect, we conferees
clearly had grown with this issue.
Earlier on the same panel, Gloria
Wade Gayles, a Black Council on
Racial Equality worker who
described the "unimagined
profanity" and also generosity of
spirit that characterized her
experiences in jail, commented on
how unfortunate it was "we
separated race and gender without
realizing" that at the axis of the
problem of obtaining racial
equality lay race, and class, and

gender. She ended by saying, "I
don't think there's any issue more
important to address than women's
reality."

During the next panel, The
Origins of Modern Feminism in the
Civil Rights Movement, Hayden, who
is white, mused that she might not
at the time really have believed
her analysis in the memo she
co-authored with Mary King.
Speaking for many of us, she said
"SNCC had my heart." The second
memo she saw as necessary to
sustain women's presence in the
work at hand. Consciousness
probably didn't manifest full blown
for anyone; and Rothschild

emphasized that she herself had not
had any of these experiences. Her
paper was based on secondary
interview data.

Some of the meetings white women
came close to being half the
audience. The panel on which Mary
Rothschild spoke had perhaps 34%
Black attendance; the session on
modern feminism was close to 90%
white.

I felt undeniable warmth in an
auditorium that contained Jo
Freeman and Sara Evans, Cathi
Sarachild, Laura X and Flora
Crater, with whom I and others
carried into the women's liberation
movement the ideas of the civil
rights movement. I also felt
deeply lonely and toyed with the
notion of walking to the reflecting
pool outside to re-experience many
of the connections that brought us
to Atlanta in the first place.

I stayed in the auditorium,
though. As we later said, together
in the litany of commemoration:
"We are here because we are proof
that we can change others through
the power of love." Along with
these women I had long ago chosen a
road to growth and change which, in

intervening years, we had trod
doggedly. Shin splints, torn
ligaments and exhausted arches

notwithstanding, I believe we came
to Atlanta to “honor those who
showed us loving means to a loving
end," and as President Cole said,

this coming together was like
looking in a mirror. We saw
ourselves. Not a sentimental

experience, it was a direct action

and means of speaking truth.
Writing in Buffalo a week after

the conference's conclusion, I feel

that the act and
redemptive community, to which
Casey Hayden spoke during the
proceedings, still hold for me, as
they do for her, a certain purity.
As a result, I find myself unable
entirely to reject radical humanism
for all the pitfalls humanism has
demonstrated over these last years
of dogged movement. Time also has
brought me near Hayden's idea that
nonviolence is an issue of feminism
and patriarchy.

During the closing plenary on
the 15th, Mrs. Coretta Scott King
mentioned wondering with other
conference organizers how many
white women would be there, and she
acknowledged white women's presence
in the collective experience of
nonviolent struggle. “As Martin
said," she said, "'there's no
separate path to liberation for
Blacks,' or for any other people."

To my left in this last session,
held at the Wheat Street Baptist
Church, sat Jed, to my right sat
Karen, and we read, mingling our
voices with many voices, to
celebrate "Women in the Civil
Rights Movement, because they
taught us that compassion and
courage are sister strengths."
And, like the obligato brought by a
woman seated in a pew near me to
singing "We Shall Overcome," came
to me still more of Casey Hayden's

creation of

a search for a home,
sisterhood, to provide us all with
an experience of integrity, which
we need to keep working."

Talking afterward, Jo Freeman
offered to take my picture with Rosa
Parks. I turned shy; Jo pressed; I
acceded. Seated next to Mrs.
Parks, a woman whose posture in old
age is erect as a sapling's, I
murmured, "I don't want to be

presumptuous."

and said,
presumptuous."

several new studies are
