The Collective  
Meets...

Common Ground is very excited about  
hosting one of her first major events,  
the Women Express Performance night  
on April 20th! Featuring the women  
artists, poets and writers from the  
special March 1985 WomenExpress issue  
of CG, as well as other special  
musical guests performing, the event  
will begin at 7:30 pm at the Church  
of the Ascension on Linwood and North  
in Buffalo. Admission is $3. At  
6:30 that evening there will be a  
special reception for the artists,  
by invitation. Refreshments will  
be available for sale during the  
evening.

We think that it is appropriate  
that our first major fundraising  
effort of this year is a paper drive  
--and how convenient that it is  
just in time for your spring clean-  
ing! Please help us by bringing  
your old newspapers to EMMA on  
Thursday, April 4th, between 11  
and 7 pm, or on Good Friday, April  
5th from 11 to noon. EMMA is loca-  
ted at 168 Elmwood Ave. between  
Allen and North Streets. Sorry,  
we are not able to offer pick-up  
of newspapers.

A special Thank You to the Buffalo  
Chapter of N.O.W. this month, for  
offering their mailing list to us  
for this issue! If you are a member  
of Buffalo N.O.W., you may have  
received this paper as a free sam-  
ple issue. We urge you to consider  
a paid subscription, both to increase  
your information on happenings in  

help support your sisters’ efforts  
in putting out this newspaper. We  
are pleased to feature in this issue,  
a speech made recently by Joan Butch-  
er of the New York State Office of  
N.O.W., which Buffalo N.O.W. wished  
to make more widely available to  

its membership.

We encourage all women's organiza-  
tions in the W.N.Y. community to use  
this paper to help with their net-  
working and outreach efforts. Send  
us your announcements, a description  
of the work of your organization,  
reporting of special events, and  
we would be pleased to feature them.  
We are particularly pleased this  
month to feature some of the fine  
work done by the Lakeshore Women's  
Services Coalition, which many  
Buffalo feminists may not be fami-  
liar with.

Keep those cards and letters  
coming!

POLICY  

PHILOSOPHY - Common Ground is potentially, with  
help from Western New York women, a forum to  
celebrate the rich diversity of our community. We view  
the paper as a ribbon that may connect our com-  
monalities, our intersection points. We are inviting you  
to participate actively in the building of a support system  
for WNY women. We affirm our commitment to enhance  
the lives of women on physical, educational, spiritual,  
psychological, social and economic levels. We want to  
present, fair-mindedly, the issues that concern women,  

and information of value to women. We offer Common  

Ground as a place where women can display their art  
and personal literature, and re-view the tapestries of their  
experiences.

EDITORIAL POLICY - Common Ground is especially  
looking for articles which address the needs and interest  
of local women.

1. Common Ground is a publication of news, culture  
and dialogue from women’s perspectives.

2. News, Opinion, Analysis and Commentary will  
each be clearly labeled as such.

3. We are seeking to provide accurate, straightforward  
information of value to women.

4. The collective will not intentionally print or sup-  
port materials or viewpoints which will harm women  
because of color, sexuality, religious or ethnic  
background, physical disability or economic situation.

5. While opinions expressed in Common Ground are  
those of the authors and not necessarily those of the col-  
lective as a whole, we do accept responsibility for choos-  
ing what we print.

SUBMISSIONS — We welcome articles, letters, infor-  
mation and announcements of interest to women.  
Graphics, cartoons, art and photography will be grateful-  
ly received. We especially invite women who do not  

have access to traditional media - women of col-  

or, differently abled, economically or educationally  

disadvantaged, and those for whom English is a second  
language - to write. Suggested length of letters: 250  
words. Letters must be signed to be printed. We will,  
however, respect your privacy and withhold your name  
if you request. Suggested length of articles, commentary,  
analysis: 500-750 words. Please type and double-space  
your work, 40 characters across. If you do not have ac-  
cess to a typewriter, please print clearly. In time we hope  
to have a typewriter, paper, etc., available for those who  
request it. Include a stamped, self-addressed envelope  
and work and home phone numbers. Because we want  
to hear your voices, if your piece needs to be edited for  
length or clarity, we will call you/ask you to do it. Keep  
copies of your work. We will try to notify you within  
three (3) weeks if we intend to use your work. If we print  
it, we will give you five (5) copies of the issue in which  
it appears. Artwork should be black and white copies  
only, and title/describe your work. We will copyright the  
entire issue, but the copyright on each piece reverts to  
the author/artist, that she may decide where her work  
is printed. Please request a style-sheet for further infor-  
mation and guidelines if you want to write.
