own actions through songs, dance,
weavings, paintings and personal
testimony. There will be informational

WomenSpeak, a half-hour weekly radio
program sponsored by U.B.'s Women's
Studies, presents contemporary national
and local issues of interest to women
and the WBFO listening audience.

The program explores issues that
affect women and their lives. Women
are given little opportunity to speak
in today's world, and more importantly
to be listened to. Women are exposed
continuously to interpretation of
their lives. Their problems and ex-
periences that are uniquely their own,
and understood by other women, often
receive misinterpretation from sources
other than their own voices. To give
a balanced view of women's lives to

a listening audience, WomenSpeak will
give an in-depth view of a single
issue during each program. The pro-
gram will be a magazine style format.
The discussion may be literary, dra-
matic, musical, analytical, sociolo-
gical, historical or a combination

of these. The program is aired on
alternating Sundays, at 4:30 pm on

FM 88.

Special one-session programs are
available from WOMANFOCUS, a local
prevention program designed to
address the special stresses that
impact on women's lives, on a

wide variety of topics such as
Women, Stress and Drugs; Assertive-
ness; Women and Panic Attacks; and
Dealing With Anger. If your organ-
ization might be interested in a
WOMANFOCUS workshop, call 842-1766
to discuss possible programs.

A Statement from the Organizers of
New England Women's Musical Retreat
It is with deep sorrow and great
anger that we announce that there
will be no New England Women's Musi-
cal Retreat on Labor Day Weekend,
1986. On May 18th when we arrived
at Ten Mile River Scout Camp for
an on-site meeting, the Boy Scouts
presented us with the following
conditions for rental of the land:
1) that the word "lesbian" be removed
from all printed materials 2) that
the chapels not be used by us and
3) that a 25% increase be paid for
Scout insurance in addition to a
5% increase already contracted for.
We believe that the first two condi-
tions were the direct result of the
article entitled "1,000 Lesbians
Gather for Weekend Workshop,” which
appeared on Sept. 8, 1985, in the Times
Herald Record of Middleton, N.Y. We,
the ten-member planning committee,
reached a unanimous decision we could
not comply with the first condition
which is directly counter to the
purpose and philosophy of NEWMR. We
pointed out to the camp director that
NEWMR is an event open to all women
and challenged their blatantly dis-
criminatory policy. He was not will-
ing to make any changes. Having been
through three site searches in the
last five years, we knew it would
be virtually impossible to find an-
other site at this late date. We
decided instead, to commit ourselves
to a vision of NEWMR '87. NEWMR has
always been the creation of hundreds
of women; we ask you now for your
continued support and input. Here
is what you can do: 1) please con—
tribute as generously as you can. We
need money for expenses already in-
curred during the last five months
of approximately $5,000. 2) Work with
us or hold your own fundraising event
in your community. 3) Help us with
a land search for NEWMR '87. We need
at least 250 acres with both open land
and privacy. We would like future
NEWMR's to be held on woman-owned
land. Please send money, comments
or questions to NEWMR, P.O. Box 217
New Haven, Conn. 06513, Include a
self-addressed stamped envelope if
you want a response. You can also
leave a message on the NEWMR phone:
203-529-6840, return calls will need
to be collect.
