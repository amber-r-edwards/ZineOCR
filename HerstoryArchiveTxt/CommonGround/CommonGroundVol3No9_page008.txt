My Mother’s  
Smile  

A REFLECTION

My father cried at my wedding. My  
mother did not. She stood at Dad's  
side, smiling. For years I misinter-  
preted that smile. For years I didn’t  
realize what her smile meant.  

I don't know exactly when it fin-  
ally occurred to me. Maybe, like so  
many other things in life, the reali-  
zation came bit by bit until one day  
it was there. And I remembered.  

Yes, I remembered when I had seen  
her smile in that same way before.  

I was small. I don't recall when  
the smile appeared or if my memory  
of that happening is an accumulation  
of several happenings, several smiles.  
Yes, that is probably the way it  
works. I was in the hospital. When  
I was two and a half years old, there  
was an operation. There were several  

operations over the years until I  
was seven years old. The scars from  
all of the operations are still on  
my face. Other scars lurk deep in-  
side somewhere, I'm sure.  
I looked up from my hospital bed  
and there was Mom. She was smiling.  
What courage, what strength had filled  
her that day, all of those days?  
There was another time. Another  
time when she smiled and I misinter-  
preted her smile. Now I know what  
it meant. Dad was in State Hospital  
at that time. He wanted to come  
home to celebrate their wedding anni-  
versary! But he was not well enough  
yet to come home. I was thirteen  
or fourteen at the time, I don't re-  
member which. My memories of the  
year Dad spent in the State Hospital  
on Forest Avenue are vague. I want  
them to remain vague. But I do re-  
member two things. I remember Dad  
cried that day. And I remember  

Mom's smile. Then crashing down upon the jagged rocks,  
Now I know, I know what her smile  
has meant all these times. How could  
I have been so stupid, not to have  
known sooner? Why has it taken all  
these years to realize?  
I wonder. When another tragedy re-  
strikes our family and we all turn  
to Mom for strength and comfort, I  
wonder if she will smile then. I  
think she will.  
I close my eyes and see her at  
my wedding. That day, nineteen  
years ago, I was only seeing the  
smile on her lips. Today, I can look  
deeper and see the tears in her  
eyes. Yes, I can finally see the  
pain, the concern, the tenderness.  

I can see all of these emotions in  
her smile and more. There are no  
words to describe my mother's smile.  
Only feelings.
