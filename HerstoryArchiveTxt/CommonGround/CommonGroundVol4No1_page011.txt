Another Mother Tongue

Another Mother Tongue: Gay Words,  
Gay Worlds by Judy Grahn. Boston:  
Beacon Press, 1984  

reviewed by Joan Dickenson  

For several years, I have been  
troubled about the anti-gay things  
I hear my children say. Although  
the three of them, age 14, 13, and  
11, don't hear homophobic talk at  
home, they go to school—and come  
home calling each other "faggot,"  
"queer-bait," “you queer," "you  
fairy;" “you dyke," and so on.  

How to fight this? I talk about  
lesbians and gay men, especially  
my own friends. I tell the kids  
to use "skunk" and "ass" as epithets  
(apologies to the skunk lobby). I  
buy books. I play music by Meg  
Christian and Alix Dobkin. Mostly;  
as with sexist language, I nag, nag,  
nag. "Look at that squirrel—isn't  
he cute?" my son will say. "How do  
you know it's a he?” I ask. "Did  
you see his penis?"  

But for the most part, I've been  
unable to share my realization that  
lesbians, especially, are not a de-  
spised group but the cutting edge  
of society, the natural leaders of  
new thought. Theory by Audre Lorde  
and Adrienne Rich is written in  
small print, “without pictures and  
conversation"—Alice in Wonderland's  
complaint. That's why I was so  
pleased this morning to be able to  
share a fragment of Judy Grahn's  
Another Mother Tongue with my 13-  
year-old daughter.  

Having taken out her earrings  
because the holes are infected, she  

ROMANCE CONTINUED  

to a miraculously sensitive human  
being. Prince Charming is perfect—  

older, bigger, richer, better educated,  

more experienced. He should be won-  
derfully strong, but not brutal.  
“Forceful persuasion" (?!), but not  
rape, is evidently acceptable. Dis-  
tressingly, the authors find violent  
sexuality, seldom found in romances  
published ten plus years ago, is  
now common, despite the fact that  
most avid readers reject this.  

Despite a stormy beginning, the  
hero eventually nurtures the heroine  
in the way the reader would like to  
be. Each romance is ideally a uto-  
pian wish-fulfillment fantasy.  

Both Jensen and Radway conclude the  
cause of the repetitive consumption  
of these novels is their short-lived  
therapeutic value, made necessary  
by a culture that creates a need  

in women it cannot fill.  

An interesting development running  
throughout Radway's book concerns a  
study made of hard-core readers in  
a small mid-Western community.  

These women (1/3 in the work force,  
almost half completing some college)  
felt obliged, during the interviews,  
to excessively rationalize this  
highly innocuous, innocent escape.  
They appeared to have to justify both  
time and expenditure to their hus-  
bands, insisting on the same leisure  
and gratification taken for granted  
by husbands and children. "You've  
come a long way, baby?" I found  
this reportage to be the most dis-  
tressing of all.  

was telling me, "There's a girl at  
school who wears three earrings in  
one ear and four in the other.”  

We talked about how heavy that must  
feel, and I mentioned the gay cus-  
tom of wearing one earring—or an  
odd, unbalanced number—as a signal  
to others of the same persuasion  
(Another Mother Tongue, page 94).  
Then I asked her, "Do the kids in  
your school have any taboos about  
wearing certain colors on a certain  
day?"  

"Oh yeah," she replied. "You can't  
wear green on Thursday—that's  
queers’ day. But it's just a joke;  
no one really believes it."  

"I'm not so sure," I said. "It's  
a widespread custom—in my school  
Thursday was queers’ day too." I  
jumped up and went for my treasured  
copy of Judy Grahn's amazing work.  
"Wait, let me look in the index..."  
Found "Thursday, taboo about wearing  
green on, page 76-79." Turned to  
the page and quickly read her the  
passage that explains who the fair-  
ies were, that “green was the pri-  
mary color they wore" (page 78), and  
how the taboo came about. I finished  
with Grahn's summary:  
The green-wearing Fairy people  
and the Celtic wisewomen and  
wizards had used Lesbian and  
Gay sex rites in ceremonies  
held especially on Thursdays  
and had been heavily pun-  
ished, murdered, publicly  
terrorized for it—ancestors  
of my high school contempor-  
aries, ancestors of mine had  
been those witches and wit-  
nesses to their fall from  
power. So the strange little  
warning phrase of never wear-  
ing green on a Thursday lest  
you be taken for one of them  
creates a bond with them over  
the centuries. (page 81)  

"Wow," said my daughter. "Let  
me see that book." She leafed  
through it and handed it back (no  
pictures and little conversation),  
but the book, one of the few I've  
ever bought without waiting for the  
paperback edition, will remain here,  
and maybe she'll pick it up again  
sometime.  

What a joy it must be for a  
small-town lesbian—thinking her-  
self alone, freakish, maybe even  
sick—to come upon this book and  
know herself a member of a cross-  
cultural tradition that spans mil-  
lenia. Grahn does not limit herself  
to the western European, Graeco-  
Roman, Anglo-Saxon, and Celtic tra-  
ditions but examines gay language,  
customs, and cultural history from  
Africa, native north and south  
America, India, Asia, the Pacific  
islands and elsewhere.  

Moreover, she connects long-ago  
tribal, ceremonial gay functions to  
the cultural attributes of the dykes  
and faggots of today:  

As the butch of a European  
tribe, she would have taken  
on the garb and the persona  
of the Horned God, or "devi"  
during the witch coven meet-  
ings or other festival gath-  
erings of pagan times. In  
her modern form she is  

COMMON GROUND ~~

entitled to wear leather, to  
decorate her body with tattoos  
and heavy jewelry in the an-  
cient tribal manner, to talk  
and carry her body in the  

old way of the cross-dressing  
female. She is a child of  
Oya, of Artemis, of Wila  
Numpa, of the Amazons, of the  
Valkyries, and of Joan of Arc.  
(page 158)  

She also connects us to historical  
figures. She traces the word "bull-  
dyke," for instance, to Queen Boudi-  
cca (pronounced Boo-uh-DIKE-ay,  
page 137), "the leader of a major  
Celtic revolt in A.D. 61 against  
the Roman conquest of the tribal  
people of Britain" (page 136).  

Grahn speaks of gay goddesses,  
connecting us to figures whose power  
came from their worshipers and whose  
devotees exalted them because of  
their power. To me, a child of  
agnostic-atheist Jewish parents,  
raised to think religion a crutch  
for the weak and ceremony a useless  
bore, Another Mother Tongue opens a  
new world where symbols offer women  
a way to power, and we who scorn or  
ignore them are only being obtuse.  

Grahn writes not only of tradi-  
tions inside gay culture but also  
of the gay role in society as a  
whole, through the ages from pre-  
history into our own time and place.  

Even in the extreme negative  
areas, such as the current  
epidemic of AIDS affecting  
the Gay male communities,  
we need to be articulate  
and protective about our  
position in society... If  
our modern society under-  
stood its Gay people as  
"who goes first" rather  
than "who does bad things"  
research would be institu-  
ted on a wide scale to de-  
termine how we are all con-  
tributing to the breakdown  
of our own immune systems...  
(page 280)  

It is the idea of connection—  
the revolutionary, feminist, and  
gay notion that North American women  
of the late 20th century are not  
members of a new, unique society  
but brief players in a long drama,  

a pageant in which vital threads  
continue, unbroken, for centuries—  
that will stay with me as the  
essence of Grahn's book. Grahn  
places us in history, every one of  
us—male and female, gay and straight,  
and everyone in between and else.  
Nor does she make the non-gay person  
feel left out. She does not call  
for women of today to return to  

some lost tribal society by imita-  
ting its customs, but to create  
powerful ways of being that both  
belong to today and stem from yes-  
terday.  

I know it's customary, even in a  
favorable review, to find fault with  
something about one's subject.  
Bowing to tradition, then, I'll say  
that the only lack I see here is  
that I want more—more from Judy  
Grahn, more gay stories based in  
various societies, more women's
