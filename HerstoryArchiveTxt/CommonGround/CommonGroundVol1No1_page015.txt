TALC POWDER AND CANCER

A study conducted at Brigham  
and Women's Hospital in Boston  
found women who dusted their geni-  
tals and sanitary napkins with  
talcum powder are three times as  
likely to develop ovarian cancer.

In comparing the hygiene habits  
of 215 Boston women with ovarian  
cancer and 215 healthy women, 32  
women (15 percent) with cancer  
used talcum powder on their geni-  
tals and sanitary napkins, while  
only 13 in the non-cancer group  
used the talc in that way.

In reporting the study results  
(in the July issue of the journal  
Cancer), Dr. Daniel W. Cramer said  
further research is needed before  
doctors could recommend that women  
should not use talc. However, he  
also said he now advises his pa-  
tients to use other products, such  
as creams or cornstarch-based  
powders.

Cramer explained that talc (the  
substance used in most body powders),  
is a magnesium silicate similar  
to asbestos, which has been linked  
to lung cancer. He confirmed that  
some talcum powders have been found  
to be contaminated with asbestos.

An estimated 18,000 cases of  
ovarian cancer are reported yearly  
and 12,000 women die from the  
disease yearly. It is the fifth  
leading cause of cancer deaths  
among women.

M&T Named in  
Sex-Discrimination Suit

Marion L. Hendershott of Chili, N.Y.,  
has filed a complaint with the state  
Human Rights Division, claiming she was  
denied a AAA/VISA credit card by M&T  
Bank because of sex discrimination.

In her complaint, Mrs. Hendershott,  
a secretary in the Churchville-Chili  
School District, said she should have  
qualified for the credit card because  
she had "established credit, held the  
same job for 23 years, and lived at the  
same address for 31 years."

In addition, she claims men who have  
either no established credit or less  
established credit than she does have  
been given a AAA/VISA card at M&T Bank.

Richard E. Clark, regional director  
to the Human Rights Division, reports  
Hendershott has credit cards at  
Sibley's, J.C. Penney's and Edwards that  
are each at least 15 years old and all  
in good standing.

M&T Bank refused to comment on the  
case, but a spokesman said the bank  
“does not make credit decisions based  
on race, creed, color or sex."
