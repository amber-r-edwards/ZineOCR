POOoe ly

by Sharon Green

Some of our readers know, but
undoubtedly many do not, that Common
Ground is put out each month, from

collective. In other words, the
30 or so of us who contribute re-
gularly to the operation of this
paper, do not yet paid a penny for
our work.

Even though I've been with CG
since it began nearly three years
ago, I'm still astounded by this
fact. When I tell people about
CG, whether it be a personal friend
or a university class, I emphasize
this. Indeed, I'm even a little
eager to brag about it!

What kind of women would give
up their spare time to do one or
more of the many and varied tasks

for this newspaper? And what motivates
them to do it month after month?

Because I thought our readers
might wonder, and also might like
to get to know who we are a little
better, I’ve decided to do an occa-
sional interview in this column
with a dedicated collective member.

My first interview is with Chris
Van Veghten, one of CG's founding
mothers.

SG: How did CG come about?

CV: CG came about when a group of
five women in Buffalo got together
in March 1982. They thought that
having a newspaper for women in
Western New York was a good idea.
One of the major reasons we thought
that was because there were quite

a variety of women's groups in the
area (80 or more), but very few
knew what the other groups were
doing. We saw the newspaper as a
major focus for networking a lot

of these groups and women and ener-
gies.

We, this group of five, met to

do some initial planning for several
months. We did surveys in the com-
munity, to see what others felt the
need was, and then in May, we held
a meeting of interested women.

SG: What in your background enabled
you to contribute to CG?

CV: One of the nice things about

this newspaper is that you really

don't have to have a lot of previous

experience in any field to parti-

cipate. You just have to have the
commitment.

We do have women who work with
the paper who have specialized
skills, such as graphic artists,
typesetters, etc. I was an English
major; so I've had a little ex-
perience with writing. We all
learn and we all share skills be-
tween us. But it doesn't take any
particular skill to come into the
paper and do something effective.
The on-the-job training and exper-
ience work fairly well.

SG: What, in your own life, keeps
you committed to the existence and
survival of a newspaper for women?

CV: Basically, I just have a com-
mitment to building the women's
community in the area, because I
think that will accomplish a whole
number of things. I think what
we've done in this newspaper has
had far-reaching effects in a lot
of areas that I’ve been concerned
with, especially women's politics
and networking. CG has helped
advance the work of a number of
organizations such as EMMA, the
Western New York Women's Resource
and Cultural Center, WAND (Women's
Action for Nuclear Disarmament)
and the Buffalo Chapter of NOW.

I think having a cohesive
women’s community in the area can
do a lot to help raise each others'
consciousness, to help further goals
that are shared by women, to further
economic goals, to give the spirit
of sisterhood and to let people know
that if they have these sorts of
interests and commitments, they
are not out there alone. There are

a lot of other women with the same
sorts of goals and the same sorts
of ideals and values, and they can
work together with people, rather
than in isolation.

SG: About how much time do you
devote to CG?

CV: It varies. I work on different
committees on the paper, each with
a different time schedule. I go to
selection meetings, which are held
once a month. I enjoy the layout
work of the paper; that takes most
of a weekend, Saturday and Sunday
afternoons.

SG: How does your time commitment
compare with that of others at CG?

CV: I would like to emphasize that
we have about 30 women who give some
amount of time to the paper. This
can be from an hour a month on up.
Everyone's contribution is important.
We have an accountant who consults
with us, for instance. The work she
puts in is mostly at tax time, of
course, but her contribution is
extremely important. People also
write occasional articles, do occa-
sional photography, report on some
events, and these contributions are
critical. Not everyone puts in the
same amount of time; we each give
what we feel capable of.

SG: What other work do you do?

CV: Many of us who work for CG also
hold full-time jobs. I work at Erie
County Medical Center, in the Rehab-
ilitation Department. I work with
out-patients who have some type of
disability. I work in the vocational
department, trying to help these
folks into the right kind of job or
training program where they can put
their talents to the best use.

SG: Why have you continued with
this volunteer work?

CV: I think everyone has to get
something out of it personally.
One of the major things for me is
that I'm working with a fine bunch
of very dedicated women. I enjoy
their company. We have a shared
set of goals and values, and even
though we are a very diverse group
in a lot of ways, we get along
together very well. This is one of
the major reasons I stay with
the paper.

I would like to say a little more
about the women in CG. We have
women from age 23 to about 65. We
have women with families, single
mothers, grandmothers, lesbians,
straight women, a wide variety of
lifestyles and educational back-
grounds. But we all have both a
commitment to CG and a commitment
to a growing women's community in
Buffalo. We get to see a number of
different viewpoints and be exposed
to a number of different things and
that's important to all of us, I
think.

SG: What would you like to see in
CG's future?

CV: I have many dreams for CG.
First, I'd like to see the paper
become financially stable and have
enough ongoing financial support
from ads and subscribers. Then we
could devote ourselves to a number of
more idealistic goals. With a few
more collective members, some of
the strain of daily tasks would
ease, and we could all devote more
time to creative issues we were
interested in.

Even though there is value to

having an all-volunteer collective,
I would eventually like to see a
couple of paid positions. Then —
people could devote themselves full-
time to the paper and the paper
could be a source of support for,
say, 2 or 3 women in the community.
I think this would be good for CG
and the community.

I work on the calendar and announ-
cement section of the paper, and I
would like to see regular submissions
from every group or women's organ-
ization in the W.N.Y. area. I'd
like to see this page become as di-
verse and wide-reaching as possible
so that you all could look at CG and
see what is happening at any time,
see what group you might be interested
in and where you could devote your
energies in the community. Promoting
that kind of networking is one of
the reasons that the paper was star-
ted.

I'd also like to see more contro-
versial articles in CG. I'd like
to see people writing on philosoph-
ical issues, on various aspects of
what's happening in the women's
community. I'd like to see more

women from our shared dreams.

The Everywoman Opportunity Center
helps women become self-sufficient
and financially independent members
of the community. Program partici-
pants demonstrate increased self-
respect, confidence and awareness.
An instructor related that while
teaching a class for math skills,
one woman sobbed at her desk. She
was overwhelmed when she realized
she was able to solve the assigned
problem. She shared, “I've been
told I'm worthless. Now I know I
do have skills." Women speak out:
“The program works...helping me to
help myself...I like the new me...
The encouragement, instruction, and
incentive helps us to be more con-
fident and capable women."

Programs are designed to meet the
needs of women who must enter or
re-enter the job force, but lack the
necessary confidence, self-esteem,
and work experience to find employ-
ment. A majority of women at the cen-
ter are women who have had to assume
roles of both parents as well as
manage households upon the death or
disability of a spouse, or separation,
or divorce. They are young and old,
some with families, some single women
with no family financial support on
which to depend. Together they re-
present women who did not plan for
the change in responsibilities and
now need assistance to effectively
deal with their economic and personal
situation.

The Displaced Homemaker program
serves homemakers who need help in
making a smooth transition from de-
pendency to permanent personal se-
curity and economic self-sufficiency.
Participants in the Job Readiness
Program are given information and
assistance in career planning, job
search skills, assertiveness training,
resume writing, interviewing skills,
and personal development.

Project Employ/Enrich is an assis-
tance program for Head Start families.
Support groups, information sessions,
individual tutoring for G.E.D. test
preparation, workshops on job hunt-
ing, life coping, and personal en-
richment are some of the supportive
services provided to the families
and significant others of Head Start
children.

The Older Workers Program helps
workers 55 and over (according to
PIC requirements) find employment
through job skills, referrals and
placement. Working Together is de-
signed to enhance the value of ma-
turity; life experience and motivation
and to dispel employer myths regarding
the aged.

Enriching lives with new meaning,
and increasing job options by pro-
viding growth, independence and di-
rection is the vital work of the
Everywoman Opportunity Center. Par-
ticipants continue to be well served
by a dedicated staff who value and
believe in the potential of women.

Volunteers are encouraged, and
receive the opportunity for work
experience, and the satisfaction of
giving energy to a worthwhile endeavor.
To begin a wardrobe resource, career
clothing donations are requested.
Career counselors are available
for information on program schedules,
work opportunities, and referrals.

Street at Seneca, downtown Buffalo.
The executive director is Myrna F.
Young. Satellite offices are loca-
ted in Fredonia, Niagara Falls,
and Tonawanda.

Everywoman Opportunity Center.

Letters to the Editor, more give
and take.

But it is hard to see past the
immediate. I'd like to see CG be-
come a financially solvent and a
more stable organization so that we,
as a collective, and with input
from the community, could sit down
and together create a positive, nur-
turing, forward-looking reality for

PERSPECTIVE

The Political
Economy of

Emick &
Williams

by Margaret Snell

It should have come as no surprise
to the radical feminist left that
Leslie Ann Emick would be convicted.
The patriarchy could have done
nothing less. Leslie Ann threatened
the very foundation of the patriarchy
and the patriarchy struck back!

We ask ourselves, how did this
tiny, abused, beaten and degraded
woman menace the powerful patriarchy
of the corporate state? She broke
a cardinal rule of the patriarchy:
women have no right of self-defense.

How then did Willie Williams
threaten racist white capitalist
patriarchy? Willie Williams is a
poor, uneducated, unemployed truck
driver. He is a devout fundamental-
ist religious believer. The man
Williams assaulted was a Black man
with an extensive criminal record.
The entire nation supported Williams
in his anger over the assault, kid-
napping and rape of his ten-year-
old daughter. The American criminal
injustice system is notorious
for its historic lack of concern for
the lives and liberty of Black and
poor people. What caused this un-
customary reaction of the system?
The implications of seeing the Black
community pursue, apprehend and at-
tempt to mete out punishment to the
culprit, for a crime committed
against a Black with no aid from
the white law enforcement, frighten-
ed the power structure. The Black
community is a source of much unre-
stricted plunder, vice, dope and
much illegal activity controlled
by whites, and these profits could
be threatened by the nightmare of
Blacks actually defending the Black
community. Who knew where it would
lead? Profits were in danger; Blacks
had to be taught a lesson so Williams
could not go unpunished, the rape of a little
girl notwithstanding.

Historically in America, neither
Blacks nor women have been accorded
the right of self-defense. Both
Emick and Williams have broken car-
dinal rules of the patriarchal state
and both were severely punished.

The oppression of Blacks and women
is both political and economic. In
a system based upon private property,
women and Blacks are viewed as com-
modities, existing solely as labor
power for the profit of the capital-
ist economic system.

Women and Blacks are both sources
of cheap labor and exploitation.
Just as women have no proprietary
rights to their own bodies, Blacks
have no proprietary rights to the

WORKING
ON UNITED WAY
DOES MORE THAN
GET YOU OUT
OF YOUR HOUSE.

IT GETS YOU OUT

OF YOURSELF.

United Way can make very
good use of whatever time and
energy you can give. Any
time of the year. We'll work hard
together. Because it takes
hard work and commitment to
keep United Way working
efficiently. But it’s worth it.
Just remember: You may lift
somebody's spirits.
Possibly your own.
