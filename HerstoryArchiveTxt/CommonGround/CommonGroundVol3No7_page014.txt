You Are Away

I am a cat careening  
up against the walls  

in this living room  

left in the house too long  

alone  

I dance, I roll on the floor  

at once happy, or fearful, or impatient  
knowing you will soon  

be home  

I move from room to room  

picking up objects  

things we bought together  

for this home  

two fat wax candles  

one white kitchen towel  

second-hand Matilda, the lamp  

bamboo shades for these wide windows  

I look out them often  

for you you you  

are coming home tonight  

how much freedom I have had  
exploring this house  
alone  

how it has made me  

want to have you here  
like never before  
when you are gone  

I often vow  

when I sleep and rise  
talk when I want to talk  
how motionless, I read  
instead of hold and stroke  
your head in my lap  

the way  
my exhaustion  

keeps me from this life  
we have gathered  
together  

the way  

tonight I have all the lights  
on in this house  

trying to make up for  

not having you here  

I vow I vow  

when you come home  

I will turn each lamp  

in these rooms off  

and in darkness  

I will touch  

what has been missing here

Island  

Like a giant emerald  
fashioned by the sun,  
you lie waiting,  
beautiful and forbidden,  
greening the sea.  

Aware of my desire,  

you make no promises,  
knowing that I know  

you are not  

all you seem to be.

Anne of Cleves  

She was dealt him  
like a card in a game:  
a Rhineland, Lutheran queen  
to bluff  
the Latin, Catholic kings.  

She came to him  
as she was  
skin like curdled milk  
and hands that only knew  

the push and pluck  

of needlepoint.  

The very texture  

of her German speech -  
rough as burlap -  
rubbed him raw.  

She was the sister-woman;  

content with her ladies  

and her colored yarns;  
content with contentment.  

The Six Wives  

He dreamed of  
someone silky;  
someone whose laughter  
could catch the light  
like a well-cut emerald.  
And here was she  
with her German tongue  
clattering  
like wooden clogs  
on a stone floor.  

Divorce  
came quickly;  
like snipping the knot  
and drawing out the thread.  

I  

of Henry VIII  

Catherine of Aragon  

In the morning of his manhood  
There was Catherine,  
cradle queen;  
bartered at birth;  
baptized and betrothed.  

She married Wales, then England  
widowed princess  
sonless queen.  

Sonless.  

So much depended  
on a womb;  
and hers was dark and empty  
as a cathedral's vaulted ceiling.  

She hurled prayers  
like pebbles  
but they clattered around  
her like a broken rosary:  
sons born  
as still as stone;  
and only sons were sacrament -  
were body and blood  
to bind husband-king  
to past promises.  

But she was sonless;  
and his hands were hungry  
for smoother flesh.  

Divorce:  
the tearing,  
tearing;  
the ragged edges  
unraveling,  
thread by thread;  

until she was  
the frayed remnant  
of love.  

Sonless,  
he removed her from his life  
as he'd remove  
a loose hair  
from his coat.

Astronomy Lesson  

When I was little  
I believed the stars  

Were holes God punched in the sky  
To prove to doubters:  
That there really is a Heaven.  
Then I heard a lecture  

By a scientist whose authority  
Was unquestioned,  

Even by the President of  
the United States.  
He spoke of galaxies and Galileo,  
Copernicus and constellations.  

It was worse than the day  

My father leveled with me  

About Santa Claus.  

The skies suddenly went cold;  

The nightlight  

That kept away the phantoms  

Went out and left me  

Trembling in the alien dark.  

But here, tonight,  

Beside you on this hillside,  

I know again the truth beyond the truth  
About the star:

Tug  

You were nine when I entered your house  

to share your narrow bedroom  

scream into your sleep  
our mealtime  
friend:  

and nudge among  

We grew  
were expected  

and began would ease  
We tug-o-war to raw hands and tear  
You were bigger stronger  

I felt I always lost  

You never felt you won  

Sometimes thoughts of you  

come back to tug again  

unprotected while peeling an orange  
and the kitchen is quiet  

Or driving at night  

when steam on the windshield  

offers your face in half tones  

against oncoming lights  

I can't afford to miss you  
a boy I hardly remember  
a man I might never know  
Might we meet again  

and not like each other  
I've been told even blood  
holds no guarantees  

But still should it be so hard  

Isn't there one thing we can count on  
oh brother oh brother oh brother of  

Leah M. Kloss  

Facsimile  

The pond mirrors  
the descending leaf -  
meeting its image.  

The brook trout's rising  
creates ripples -  

disturbing the confrontation.
