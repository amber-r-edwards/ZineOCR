HOW TO TELL A BUSINESSMAN FROM A BUSINESSWOMAN

A businessman is dynamic A businesswoman is aggressive

A businessman is good on details A businesswoman is picky

A businessman loses his temper A businesswoman is bitchy

A businessman is a go-getter A businesswoman is pushy

When he is depressed, everyone When she is moody, it must be
tiptoes past his office her time of the month

He follows through She doesn't know when to quit

He's confident She's stuck up

He stands firm She's as hard as nails

He has the courage of his She's stubborn
convictions

He is a man of the world She's “been around"

He can handle his liquor She's a lush

He isn't afraid to say what he thinks She's mouthy

He's human She's emotional

He exercises authority diligently She is power mad

He is close-mouthed She is secretive

He can make quick decisions She's impulsive

He's a stern taskmaster She's hard to work for
