ABNORMAL PAP SMEAR  
DOESN’T MEAN CANCER  

By Sherri Darrow and Diane Ruesch  

Our names are Diane Ruesch and  
Sherri Darrow and we supervise the  
Cancer Information Service Hotline  
at Roswell Park Memorial Institute.  
We receive a wide range of inquiries  
from patients, their significant  
others and the general public about  
cancer prevention, treatment and  
diagnosis. This article will focus  
on one area which is of concern to  
the majority of women: Abnormal Pap  
Smear Results and Cancer Screening.  

There is nothing that infuriates  
us more than a doctor who tells a  
woman she has an abnormal Pap smear  
and then fails to inform her that  
she doesn't have cancer. Many dis-  
traught women have called in response  
to receiving such diagnoses from  
their health care providers. We're  
glad we're here to give our callers  
a realistic perspective on medical  
procedures and terminology. However,  
it is clear that more and more women  
are calling us with the same questions  
and frustrations. We feel that the  
time has come to share our knowledge  
so fewer of us have to be victims of  
the lack of information, or misinfor-  
mation.  

This is our first attempt to promote  
a dialogue within the women’s commun-  
ity so we can 1.) assess the level  
of knowledge which women have and  
want in relationship to cancer-related  
topics; 2.) develop strategies for  
disseminating accurate up-to-date  
information; and 3.) develop strategies  
for promoting good health practices.  

In order to carry out a program  
for fulfilling these goals, we hope  
to meet with various women's organi-  
zations and agencies over the next  
year. We also invite feedback on this  
article, and ask everyone to call us  
at 845-4400 or write to us at the  
Cancer Information Service, Roswell  
Park Memorial Institute, 666 Elm Street,  
Buffalo, N.Y. 14263, and/or to  
attend the presentation to the Fem-  

inist Alliance on Monday, July 16th.  

(See calendar and announcements for  
details.)  

Before discussing the topics  
described it is important to clarify  
our assumptions. We believe that  
being an informed, active health care  
consumer is the best strategy for  
utilizing the health care system.

For example, questioning our health  
care providers, keeping our own  
health records and reading from  
various sources helps us make in-  
formed choices. By making our own  
health promotion a priority we can  
keep the often dissatisfying exper-  
iences with the health system at a  
minimum.  

The Pap smear is a simple office  
procedure which detects atypical  
(not-usual) changes which occur in  
the cells of the cervix (neck of the  
uterus). The Pap smear is a "screen-  
ing tool", that is, it is used to  
find abnormalities of the cervix in  
an otherwise healthy woman. This  
screening tool helps prevent serious  
disease from developing by revealing  
a wide range of abnormalities at a  
stage when they are easily treated  
and cured. Next to primary prevention,  
screening tools provide a means for  
maintaining good health.  

Therefore, having an abnormal  
Pap smear doesn't mean you have cer-  
vical cancer. On the other hand, if  
you have regular Pap smears your  
chances of having cervical cancer  
detected in its earliest stages,  
when it is 99% curable, is many times  

greater than a woman who goes  

untested. Symptoms have de-  

veloped. In fact, through the use  

of Pap smears and effective treatment  
methods, the death rate for women  
with cancer of the cervix has drop-  
ped 60% in the past 30 years. More  
progress has been made in reducing  
the death rate due to cervical cancer  
than for any other type of cancer.  

Pap smears are generally recom-  
mended for all women 18 years or  
older or once women begin sexual in-  
tercourse, whichever comes first.  
Most guidelines recommend yearly Pap  
smears. Certain women are encouraged  
to have more frequent testing because  
they may be at higher risk of devel-  
oping cervical cancer. You may be at  
higher risk if:  

1.) Your mother took DES during  
her pregnancy with you;  

2.) You have Herpes Simplex, Type  
I;  

3.) You've had abnormal Pap smears  
in the past;  

4.) You have a family history of  
uterine or cervical cancer;  

5.) You have had venereal disease;  

6.) You have more than one male  
sexual partner.  

You should try and assess your own  
risk and discuss the appropriate  

frequency for Pap smear exams with  
your health provider.  

It is important that women have  
regular Pap smears. This includes  
women who are celibate, lesbian women  
who are sexually active as well as  
all young heterosexual women under  
18 who are sexually active.  

The Pap smear is taken during a  
pelvic exam after a speculum is in  
place. A "Y" shaped spatula is used  
to remove cells on the surface of  
the cervix. These cells (termed  
exfoliated cells) are used to make  
a slide which is viewed under a  
microscope by a pathologist. The  
results are classified from normal  
to cancerous. (See table I.) It  
usually takes from 2-6 weeks for you  
to receive the results from your  

health provider.  

If you have an abnormal Pap smear,  
the next step is to have a repeat  
Pap smear and often a colposcopy is  
recommended. A colposcopy is a relatively new tool for diagnosing  
cervical problems and eliminates the  
need for conization (removal of a  
cone-shaped piece of tissue from  
the cervix) surgery for many women.  

The colposcope is a magnifying  
instrument which allows a close-up  
view of the most abnormal areas of  
the cervix. This allows the physician  
to focus on the zones which should  
be biopsied (have tissue samples  
taken). Unless the abnormality  
extends up into the cervical canal,  

a biopsy will help determine treatment  
options. Treatment for easily accessed  
cervical abnormalities aims at re-  
moving all abnormal cells by surgery.  

The primary procedures are cryo-  
surgery (freezing), cauterization  
(burning) or laser surgery. All three  
treatments remove abnormal tissue and
