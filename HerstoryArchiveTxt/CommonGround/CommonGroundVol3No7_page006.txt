COMMON GROUND has received  
a letter from a local man  
charging his wife's doctor  
with sexual abuse of his wife  
and other area women.

We realize this is a serious problem  
for many women. We want to cover this issue  
and we feel that the best way  
to reach women who might have  
had or are dealing with a  
problem of this nature is  
through the experiences of  
other women.

We want your input, your  
herstory. Please send us  
your story. We will fill in  
the legal research and dis-  
tribute papers to local doc-  
tors. Please help us help  
women who have been sexually  
abused by physicians.

CESP UPDATE: The Community Emer-

of MCC Buffalo, fundraisers, and  
the collection and redemption of  
TOPS register tapes.

CESP's statistics for the calendar  
year of 1984 reveal that 29 people  
in the community received a total  
of 17 weeks of food and $700 in emer-  
gency assistance. If you are inter-  
ested in donating non-perishable  
food or your TOPS tapes, they can  
be brought to MCC Buffalo every
