POET’S CORNER

Before the onset (of passion)

your eyes are pools of opaque blue

politely inquiring entry
into my

white arms

(swing round your neck)

and I watch your lowered head

seek out the curve of my breast.

Up,

your eyes meet mine;
hooded now,

heavy, deep and blue

growing darker still

It is come.

Even as I watch

there is color . . . going .

(it is true that eyes darken)

Faith

I take a leap of faith
across a gulf of reason

or lie distraught
upon dry sands
of intellect

Symphony of Summer

Full August sun of mid-morning

in tempo with mighty voices of mountains,
performing overtures of intimacy,

with light breezes blowing up from
winding silvery rivers, reflecting

deep blues of a cerulean sky.

Soft sweet emerald green grass,

A perfect setting for delicately

designed orange flowers against dark wood,

like tatted doilies arranged with delicate care.
Enter, a silent scene,

Gilded fringed daisies, daintily beaded bonnets
of embroidered lace, bowing to majestic yellow

winged butterflies.

Rich black earth gives dignity to the soil

of the land.

Offerings of inspiration through the help of
God’s knowing the fragilities of life in battles

for survival.

Warm rain breathes against my mind.... Anointing
me, Awakening the indwelling spirit of new beginnings.

Joyce Anthony Caldwell

MOLLYOLGA, CON'T

Molly: Oh yes, My husband is an
artist so in many ways we are on
the same wavelength. If he did not
have that creative push himself,

I would not have had the kind of
support I had.

Alas: It seems like most of your
support came from those close to
you. Even so, there must have been
times when it was difficult to be-
lieve that you could really carry
out your vision. What have you
learned through this all?

Molly: Five years ago I went back
to my twenty-fifth college reunion,
and I was really angry at the time.
It was the first reunion I had at-
tended, and I hadn't seen any of
these people in twenty-five years.
I kept saying to them all "they
taught us stuff and they got us all
hyped up to do something in college,
but then it was just like cut off.
Okay, now go get married and have
kids."

Nobody ever talked about what it
was going to be like in the real
world to try to be a thinking per-
son and use some of these things
you've been taught. Nobody ever
talked about it! And I was mad.

I was just furious! Why did nobody
ever say to us, ‘okay, we've got
your minds all psyched up, but if
you're going to use them, you've
got to get very practical and you
have to get your life totally

under control and use more disci-
pline than anybody ever dreamed...
that is why I'm a great one for
discipline... you have to get it
all figured out, and if you're going
to do it, it's going to be twice

as hard as it is for a man, and

you have to figure out just exactly
how you can arrange your time and
your energy so at that particular
stage in your life, given every-
thing else you have to do, it will
possibly work that you can use any

of this that you've been psyched up
through college to think you could
do.' It was never discussed! And
then one of my old friends came up
to me and said, "Yeah," she said,
"but nobody ever really expected
us to use it."

Nobody ever really expected us
to use it.
