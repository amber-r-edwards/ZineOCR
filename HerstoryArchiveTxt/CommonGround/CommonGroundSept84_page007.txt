“PARTIES”

by Sharon Green

As a child, parties meant an  
overdose of sweets and a little less  
adult supervision than usual. Then  
came teenage parties, the focus of  
which were music, eating, drinking  
our first alcoholic beverages, and  
most importantly, necking.

In adulthood, parties combined  
all of the best elements mentioned  
above—food, drink, contact with  
the opposite sex, and a "get-away-  
from-the workweek-drudgery" attitude,  
but now tempered a bit with the  
maturity of adulthood. However, as  
more and more of our friends married,  
the parties we attended consisted  
mostly of couples. And then they  
took on a new appearance; not long  
into each party, a sort of segrega-  
tion occurred, men in one room and  
women in another, not by definition  
or even plan, but by a natural desire  
and need by members of both sexes to  
be with and share with those most  
like themselves, in a very relaxed,  
even intimate setting.

When I was a young newlywed, I  
would travel between both rooms,  
torn because the men's conversation  
seemed livelier and more humorous,  
creating an atmosphere more party-  
like. At the same time, I was  
drawn to those like me, yet not  
quite sure how to communicate with  
other women, let alone women who  
were full-time homemakers and mothers.  
(I was not yet either of those.)  
Because, as a teenager, I had been  
socialized only to flirtingly con-  
verse with boys, I felt uneasy and  
sometimes even in competition with  
other females.

Well, I've matured in my ability  
to not only converse with other  
women, but also to savor my time  
with them. Such conversations  
among women (who usually end up  
clustered around the kitchen table)  
may result in anything from an ex-  
change of recipes to a serious  
heart-to-heart, replete with tears  
and hugs.

So I've both observed and felt  
the need that women have to talk  
with one another, to share common  
experiences and problems, to be  
near other women—in short to bond  
with one another. These urges seem  
to be unabashedly at their best  
during parties, probably because we  
tend to let down some of our usual  
reserves, and so we women often  
accomplish much connecting.

However, in the past few years,  
I’ve received countless invitations  
to parties of a somewhat different  
nature, that is, “selling" parties,  
as I so unaffectionately call them.  
You know the kind I mean; Tupperware  
seemed to have the corner on the  
market for years, but now there are  
a host of other products to be had  
at such "parties," ranging from  
purses to linens to needlework  
projects to lingerie, to name only  
a few of those I've been invited to.

As a feminist, I've had a hard  
time reckoning with these home  
parties. On the one hand, I am an-  
gered that women so frequently have  
to legitimize, both to their husbands  
and to themselves, an evening out  
with other women, by claiming that  
they feel compelled to attend.  
("After all, she came to mine, so I  
really should go to hers.") Then  
there's the issue of making your  
friends and relatives obligated to  
buy something from you, which is why  
I usually gracefully decline such  
invitations (and why, incidentally,  
so few of my friends will even read  
this article in Common Ground!)

But I harbor a secret urge to  
attend the parties. I am drawn to  
the opportunity to spend time with  
other women, especially without the  
distractions of children. (And  
this is no small consideration, since  
nearly all of my contact with friends  
occurs during the day; as we simul-  
taneously juggle stilted conversa-  
tions with the constant needs of  
our small children.)

And yet, at the few home parties  
I have attended, the bulk of the  
evening consisted of showing, trying  
out (or on), and buying the mer-  
chandise. Here's a typical scenario.  
Arrive about 7:30, and make small  
talk for a half-hour or so while the  
company representative spreads out  
the merchandise. Uncomfortably  
switch positions, cross and re-  
cross your legs, and display some-  
times genuine but more often feigned  
interest in the products for the  
hour or so presentation. Then  
about 9 p.m. comes the moment of  
truth: filling out the order  
blanks. After you've ordered more  
than you can afford, it's 9:30, the  
coffee is finally ready, but you're  
already thinking of heading home to  
get those pantyhose off.

Only at the end of the evening,  
over coffee and snacks is there  
space for substantial conversation,  
sharing of lives, and real connecting  
to begin. Usually by then it's so  
late that you're already thinking  
of how early you have to get up  
the next day for a job and/or chil-  
dren. Unfortunately the most  
important time of the party is  
the most abbreviated; so these par-  
ties have been, for me, an exercise  
in frustration.

Then why do so many women attend  
home parties? This question came to  
my mind as we on the Writer's  
Committee at CG pondered the notion  
of just what women's culture is. I  
felt the necessity to take another  
hard look at these parties, and I  
realized that they certainly  
account for what many women do with  
some (or even much) of their leisure  
time, especially leisure time spent  
in the company of other women. In  
the same way that culture is an  
expression of who we are, Tupperware  
parties have become a kind of social  
expression for many women I know.  
Indeed, some even identify themselves  
as the "Tupperware lady."

Clearly then, these parties need  
to be included in any discussion of  
women's culture, if for no other  
reason than that they are such fre-  
quent social gatherings for women  
(not to mention an astute reflec-  
tion of our capitalistic bent).

In an attempt to test my specula-  
tions about why women have and attend  
such parties, I informally inter-  
viewed some women I know. I asked  
them why, besides the obvious finan-  
cial rewards (which can be substan-  
tial if you have enough parties,  
and twist your friends' arms into  
having them), do they hold parties,  
and why do they go to them.

Some responses were very predic-  
table; all the women I spoke with  
said that home parties are a good  
night out. Many of them have chil-  
dren, so their jobs don't end at  
5 p.m., and getting out of the  
house is their only brief respite  
from their demanding work. Several  
women remarked that they enjoyed  
being in the company of other women,  
for a variety of reasons, ranging  
from enjoyable conversation, to  
exchange of recipes or childcare  
tips, to mingling with women of  
another generation (an interesting  
characteristic of these parties by  
the way). Still another said that  
these functions afford her the oppor-  
tunity to meet friends that she  
otherwise rarely sees. Then a few  
told me that they often book parties  
as a favor to a friend, not neces-  
sarily because they truly want to  
hold one (friendship between women  
runs deep). Finally, since coffee  
and dessert are the standard fare,  
selling parties are both simple and  
inexpensive to prepare and easy to  
clean up after, according to one of  
my sisters-in-law. And of course,  
since the sales representative does  
the bulk of the entertaining, you  
as the hostess do not have to work  
too hard!

Well, these are all admirable  
motivations, but as I asked one old  
friend of mine (also the mother of  
two little ones), "Why is it that  
we'll drop everything if we receive  
a Mary Kay Cosmetics party invita-  
tion, but on any other terms, we  
find it nearly impossible to spend  
time together any more?" For one,  
she personally feels ill at ease  
in bars (after all, we are mothers  
in our mid-30s and not looking for  
companions!), so she prefers to see  
her friends in their houses. But  
as a fellow graduate of a private  
Catholic girls' high school, she  
also reminded me how imbued we were  
in manners and social graces. Con-  
sequently, she finds it quite diffi-  
cult to turn down an invitation of  
any sort, without a very good reason.  
And perhaps this is true for many  
women.

Whatever the reasons for the  
success of home selling parties, I  
kept sensing the same feeling as I  
spoke with all these women. Even  
though it wasn't always verbalized  
as such, they seem to feel the need  
to be with, bond with and help other  
women. Because in our culture,  
being up-front about this need is  
uncomfortable, some structure—be  
it a Tri-Chem party or a baby shower—  
breaks this barrier and allows  
women this valuable opportunity to  
connect. And perhaps it is this  
very need that all our childhood and  
adolescent parties prepared us to  
meet, after all.

Commentary MALE HEROES:

When In Doubt,  
Don’t Call [Indiana] Jones

by Mary Paleologos

The reviews were fabulous—four  
stars and thirteen stripes for “In-  
diana Jones and the Temple of Doom."  
“Steven Spielberg outdoes himself,"  
the critics raved. Well, I had for-  
gotten the critics were male. And  
now after seeing the movie, I can  
understand why they got so excited.  
Being men, they could easily imagine  
themselves as Indiana—brave, strong,  
cunning, and courageous. It's like  
feeling proud of a success in the  
family—the similarity of genes makes  
one feel capable of duplicating  
another's glory.

Unfortunately, the woman portray-  
ing my people was a genuine, award-  
winning dip. Throughout the film,  
she stood with her eyes bulged out,  
her mouth frozen open, and her body  
trembling. I was forced by gender  
to try and relate to this strange  
creature attempting to pass herself  
off as a member of my sex, but it  
was impossible.

The film's underlying message came  
in loud and clear: men are the sav-  
iors of lives, while women are the  
screamers for mercy.

Somewhere in Hollywood there must  
be a flourishing, male propaganda  
studio with the solemn but profit-  
able mission of creating movies that  
make men feel good about themselves.  
If so, then that explains James Bond,  
Dirty Harry, and any other film  
starring a burly lug who indiscrimi-  
nately slugs and shoots people in the  
name of truth and justice.

But let's face it, these films  
and the men who make them aren't  
fooling anyone. In real life, men  
may still do all the shooting, but  
women are the ones who save the day.  
They do so by sustaining life, not  
destroying it.

A woman is industrious, clever,  
honest, and as brave as a lion. She  
possesses supernatural amounts of  
energy. She will hold down a full-  
time job, do the housework, and tend  
to her family's perpetual needs.

An average working mother's sched-  
ule is far more hectic than that of  
Ronald Reagan, Tip O'Neil, or Lee  
Iacocca. These men have wives to  
deal with the countless, time-consu-  
ming demands of their families. A  
woman has only herself. By dictum  
of society, she alone is responsible  
for the tedious mechanics of her and  
her family's daily existence. A wo-  
man may one day become her own boss  
but she is still her own slave. Un-  
til she actually gets someone to do  
the housework for her, no one will  
ever do it out of the kindness of  
his heart.

As a single parent, she is never  
above working a low-paying job to  
keep food on the table. (How many  
men have you seen waiting tables to  
support their families?)

She has cleverly mastered the art  
of stretching a dollar. If women  
ran the U.S. Budget Office, we  
wouldn't have a federal deficit to-  
day. In fact, we'd probably have  
enough extra money in the till to buy  
out Japan.

A woman has integrity. She can  
spot a lie quicker than a smoke de-  
tector can sense a lighted cigarette.  
And she always says what she thinks.  
This is what men refer to as "bitch-  
ing," only because they refuse to  
absorb anything that resembles the  
truth. A woman will want to hear  
the truth even if it hurts or angers  
her. The only known cases of death  
resulting from the truth and its  
complications have been men with long  
histories of lying to themselves.

For instance, when a woman falls  
in love, she will readily admit it  
to herself and to the world. A man  
will initially deny his feelings to  
himself. To a man who realizes he  
may be falling in love, a woman sud-  
denly becomes a demon he must exor-  
cise to save his soul.

Each of us has had an exception-  
ally brave woman touch our lives, be  
it a friend, relative, or spouse.  
Through her example of courage, con-  
sistent or sporadic, she inspires us  
in moments of fear or weakness. If  
you get to know any person long  
enough, you will inevitably hear  
about her.

Two stories of courage that were  
passed on to me concern my grand-  
mother as a young woman in Greece at  
the turn of the century. My grand-  
father was arguing with a neighbor  
over where to place a fence. Push  
came to shove, and my grandfather  
was on the receiving end of both.

My grandmother, a woman of sturdy  
peasant stock, was kneading dough  
in the distance, when she suddenly  
saw premature widowhood flash be-  
fore her eyes. She dashed across  
the field and belted the villain  
smack on the mouth with a punch so  
hard, he landed with a thud that  
was heard around the village. Grand-  
ma was a spirited woman, and she  
couldn't stand with her hands clasped  
over her mouth while the neighbor  
injured the man she loved.

A few years later, while walking  
home, she spotted a thief fleeing  
from her home with a sack full of  
plunder. She darted after him like  
a hound on the hunt. The thief,  
exhausted by the weight of the silver-  
ware, stopped to catch his breath.  
She swooped down upon him, grabbed  
the loot, cursed him and the mother  
who raised him, and walked away.  
She did not want revenge or even  
justice, only what was rightfully  
hers.

A woman is a cautious defender,  
not a reckless instigator. She'll  
wait for the fight and then spring  
up like wildfire, but only if she  
feels it is something worth fight-  
ing for.

In conclusion, I advise all women  
to skip the Temple and go see “Gone  
With the Wind.” You may see Scarlett  
screaming, crying, and throwing up  
bad radishes, but "As God is my wit-  
ness," she saved Tara. The grit and  
guts of Scarlett O'Hara is in the  
spirit of every woman. Rhett says  
it all when he tells Scarlett: "God  
help the Yankees if they should get  
you." I bet even Indiana Jones  
couldn't take on the whole Northern  
army.
