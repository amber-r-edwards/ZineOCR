Commentary: Puritanism

PURITANISM IS STILL WITH US

by Charlotte Churchill "helpmate" and household drudge. Over
100 years later Benjamin Franklin felt
much the same way toward the role of
women, though there is slight evi-
dence of his moving away from these
notions. In Uncle Tom's Cabin, writ-
ten by a woman, Harriet Beecher Stowe,
the female characters are at the mercy
of men, although the fact that Mrs.
Stowe was able to write and publish
this controversial book is noteworthy.

Three hundred plus years after the
Puritans, many of their attitudes
toward women are still ingrained in
many of us. "It's foolish for a woman
to learn things she will never use,
since she's just going to marry any-
how." Thus my sisters and I were
discouraged by our parents from going
to college during the 50's, though
our brother was not. However, we
were encouraged to acquire good skills
at home and in the office (a sewing
machine and typewriter were early
gifts), marry a "good" hard-working
man who would be a "good provider"
(how many times did I hear that
phrase?) and always be "good" our-
selves.

I think it is safe to say that the
American character has been formed to
a large degree by these early Puri-
tans; and in order to fully under-
stand ourselves, it may be important
to understand them. Their frugality,
self-reliance and industry have in-
fluenced modern social and economic
life, it cannot be denied. However,
some black shades of Puritanism
have lingered on and I shall relate
a personal anecdote. During the '50's
while waiting reluctantly in my pew
for the sermon to begin, I unwrapped
and chewed upon a stick of Wrigley's
Spearmint gum. Down came the stern
Yankee minister from the pulpit,
asking me, in front of the whole con-
gregation, to leave the church and
rid myself of the sticky evil from
the house of the Lord. Those were
the days of white gloves and straw
hats when nice "good" girls did not
do things like that.

Though most people no longer seem
to believe in the devil, some of the
rigid behavior of these early Puri-
tans is still in the air. Americans
may be becoming less Puritanical,
but, strangely enough, I recall such
restrictive times with a mixture of
guilt and pride.

had set her." (The American Puri-
tans, edited by Perry Miller, p. 45)
She fell into this "sad infirmity"
because she tried to release herself
from the shackles in which society
had bound her.

Another example is Anne Hutchinson,
who believed in a covenant of grace
rather than good works; and according-
ly was judged rather harshly by the
men in power. They thought it not
surprising that such an emotional re-
sponse to religion should come from
a woman since it was believed women
were controlled more by emotion than
by reason. “Moreover, because she saw
religion differently from the majority
(who believed themselves right and
on the side of God), they felt she
had been influenced by the devil.
".,.Mrs. Hutchinson's admission before
the General Court that she received
revelations direct from God was proof
positive that she had been seduced by
Satan." (p.49)

Whenever the Puritans spoke of the
qualities of a woman, it sounded like
this: "…a woman of singular virtue,
prudence, modesty, and piety..." (John
Winthrop's Journal). In describing men
"virtue" and "modesty" were absent;
words such as “wisdom”, "zeal", and
"learning" were used. It was sinful
for a woman to be wise, zealous or
learned. The woman from Hartford
wished to become wise and learned:
she paid for her sin by becoming ill.
Anne Hutchinson was zealous, if nothing
else: she paid for her sin by being
banished and eventually dying. So,
aside from raising large families, a
woman was supposed to achieve nothing
on her own, but merely act as helpmate
to her husband. The widow, Mrs. Hutch-
inson, kept refusing Samuel Sewall's
proposals for marriage; one of his ar-
guments to her was that "...she might
do some good to help and support me."
(Diary, p.248) She responded one time
by quoting the Apostle Paul: "...a
single life was better than a married."
Perhaps for the first time she wished
to stand alone and not be used as

I was brought up in New England
in the Congregational Church (now
United Church of Christ) which was
the church of the Puritans who
settled this country and will ex-
amine some of its history as it
relates to women.

Since the Puritans placed great
emphasis on the Bible, especially
the Old Testament, with its story
of Adam and Eve, they developed a
symbolic habit of mind and inter-
preted everyday occurrences in
terms of good and evil, often
placing great significance on
mundane happenings. They be-
lieved the doctrine of natural
depravity, which meant that "man"
was not born innocent and there
was no way he could merit heaven
(except for those who had been
elected). They wished to set up
a society of "good" people and
stood at moral attention, trying
to figure out which acts would
please God; in that way they
might be saved. They felt they
were right and anyone who differed
from them was wrong and therefore
on the side of the devil. Some
disastrous side effects resulted:
complete tribes of Indians were
wiped out, people (especially
women) were kept in their God-
given places, not to mention the
inhumanity of the Salem witch trials.

Their attitude of sin as applied
to women is worthy of considera-
tion. Women held a specific place
in the chain of creation (God first
made man, then woman as his help-
mate, then animals) and were not
to shake themselves from their God-
given places, as did the "woman from
Hartford" when she took to reading
and writing: "For if she had attend-
ed her household affairs and such
things as belong to women...might
have improved them (her wits) use-
fully and honorably in the place God
