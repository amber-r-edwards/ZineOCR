she said I refuse to be a victim anymore

ALASKAN MAIL ORDER BRIDE
1980 :

roots bathed in salt & blood

spreading deep & quiet

days of abuse now come to seed

and to desperate fire

The Mail Order Bride arrives in gown
and summer tresses

to place herself on the market:

she said Marshall I refuse to be a victim anymore

I watched the trial with my heart
other senses stunned raw & numb
her strength fully flowered
freely blossoming

Highest bidder take all!

In the dim lit cafes
where the liquor is drank
anyone

she said I refuse to be a victim anymore can pass for real

in the room of sympathetic eyes
sentence now cast

but her words grow & bind
healing gently strongly

The blemishes gone

and the wardrobe clean
and herself

prim and proper and good
the Mail Order Bride

none of us can be victims takes her place on the line

none of us shall be victims anymore
Now should Barnacle Joe
over there
with the scar
for Leslie ask her 'round for a look-see
December 84 she'll go
and with Cattlebred Matt
and with Barnacle Jim
and with Harbinger John and with Squatted Face Ken
and with Eagle Beaked Bill and with Slow Footed Bob
and with Landowner Mike
on and on she will go
handed down bed to bed

products, junky and cheap, are
examples of second-best merchan-
dise offered to women consumers.
I recently came to my senses
when I mentally added up the
cost of all the $4.99 plastic

grandson. When he wanted the
$30 plastic castle, this consumer

fork to make a mark on it. I
have also stirred many cups of
coffee with plastic "pick-up"
sticks. I now drink my coffee
black.

In moderation, plastic can
take its place with other pro-~
ducts and fulfill a useful func-
tion. We use it for the pro-
tection of food, and we like the
convenience and safety of the
plastic cooler on our summer
beach trips. It does not have to
take over our lives.

I remember standing ankle-
deep in a slippery, inflatable
plastic pool on a hot, summer
day trying to repair practi-
cally invisible holes and leaks

credit card.

We use our plastic credit card
to go on vacations, buy clothing,
food, liquors, gifts and more
plastic gadgets. As women, we
know we overdo, yet we give in to
the media 'hype' because it is
dinned into our senses constantly
to buy the latest item.

Most surveys of buyers, market
demographics, find that the larg-
est consumer group is women in
the 18-49 age bracket. In my
opinion, we have been manipulated
and brainwashed by the media
into buying artificiality, and
settling for second-best, as wo-
men were treated as second-
class citizens in the past. This
mind-set still exists in media
advertising. Some women accept
junk because they put little val-
ue in their self-worth. Plastic

He still does not have the castle.

I will still buy him toys, be-
cause I am a grandmother, but in
moderation. I will also go back
to basics. There is too much
hunger and need in this world for
women to waste money foolishly.

This past holiday season I
gave gifts of snowsuits, slacks
and shirts, hand-made ceramic
dishes and mugs. I received hand-
made candies, crocheted towels
and embroidery. I did purchase
one plastic man. I guess I could
not quit “cold turkey".

I have started my cycle back
toward quality and substance.
Will the "P" generation of the
80's be considered the 'good old
days' by the next generation in
the 90's, or will they decide to
change to a new era of basic
quality and substance?
