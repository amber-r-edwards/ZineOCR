Conference Report:  
Dimensions of Racism: Part Two

by Gerri Bayer and E.R. Mann

(Ed. Note: This conference, entitled  
"The Dimensions in Racial Justice",  
was sponsored by the YWCA of Buffalo  
and Erie County. Part I reported on  
the conference proceedings and work-  
shops. The main features of the con-  
ference were a presentation by Dr.  
Mary Frances Berry, U.S. Commissioner  
of Civil Rights, and workshops, in-  
volving such topics as Racism in the  
Political Process, Racism in the  
Media and Impact of Racism on the  
Economy.

Racism is defined as having the  
power to enforce or institutionalize  
one's prejudices. In this country,  
having white skin accords one that  
power, whether it is exercised or  
not.)

The workshop on “Racism in Edu-  
cation" covered the areas of covert  
racism in the classroom, textbooks,  
and the schism of identity in Afri-  
can Americans.

Panelist Mrs. Amin said that  
covert racism in the classroom is  
based on three myths: 1) Third  
world children cannot or will not  
learn--blaming environment or gene-  
tics 2) Blaming the child for her/  
his own oppression, whereas it is  
the fault of the society that a  
child is ever disadvantaged 3) that  
third world children do not want to  
learn--that the "hopelessness" of  
it is an excuse not to help the  
child.

A covert racist believes, Mrs.  
Amin said, that the oppressed de-  
serve their oppression, that a  
racist will deny a child's history  
and individuality and ignore the  
institutionalization of racism and  
does not prepare a child for it.

She offered concrete remedies  
for parents, teachers and concerned  
others:

1) Answer honestly all questions  
related to race.

2) Help the child to develop con-  
fidence. Encourage children to  
realize that they are good and nor-  
mal--but that racism is neither  
good nor normal.

3) Encourage children to have posi-  
tive self-concepts.

4) Help children realize that  
racism is a reality by teaching them  
about it, how to recognize it and  
understand its history.

Mrs. Doyle, of the Buffalo Board  
of Education, discussed the racism  
implicit in textbooks, saying that  
there has been little improvement in  
the representation of Black people  
in history. She also said that there  
are very few textbooks for children  
that deal with the issue of racism.

Her advice to parents to remedy  
these problems includes examining  
textbooks for misrepresentation of  
Blacks and for missing information;  
talking to teachers about the text-  
books that children use, getting  
involved in Parent-Teacher Associa-  
tions and the Board of Education to  
express ideas about racism, and expo-  
sing children to good role models,  
other than in the media.

Mrs. Amin suggested that teachers  
should learn and teach about other  
cultures, talk to parents and devel-  
op good multi-cultural materials  
if there are not any available.

ANALYSIS:

The process by which this con-  
ference was reported to you, the  
reader, is interesting.

This was a conference about  
racism sponsored by the YWCA. It  
was organized and run primarily  
(but not exclusively) by Blacks and  
supported by predominantly minority  
organizations. It was attended by  
two white women as reporters, record-  
ing and analyzing the opinions and  
feelings of the mostly Black panel-  
ists and participants for a predom-  
inantly white readership. Both re-  
porters felt their feminism made them  
process the proceedings with an  
eye and ear to making feminist and  
anti-sexist connections with this  
anti-racist conference, although this  
was not a focus of the conference.  
The reporters' white perspectives,  
as well as feminism, undoubtedly  
had an impact on the processing of  
the information presented and deci-  
sions about what was important to  
report. It is important for a reader  
to understand that the day-long  
fast-paced conference presented here  
has been filtered twice: through a  
feminist sensibility and a white  
sensibility.

Both reporters felt they learned  
something about themselves and their  
racist attitudes and also learned  
more about minority culture and  
minority people by having direct  
dialogue.

This conference was an important  
step in fulfilling the YWCA's imper-  
ative of "eliminating racism wherever  
it exists and by any means necessary."  
Bringing together so many people and  
perspectives was a difficult task,  
and the local YWCA should be con-  
gratulated for the effort.

APFIRMATIVE ACTION CONSIDERATION  
RULED OUT

The Supreme Court ruled 6-3 that  
in the case of Memphis, Tennessee  
firefighters, employers may not be  
forced to lay off white male workers  
with more seniority than women and  
minorities, and therefore protect  
affirmative action gains by the wo-  
men and minorities. It reinforces  
the Reagan administration's view  
of affirmative action which opposes  
the use of quotas or numerical goals  
in hiring, promotion or layoffs to  
remedy past discrimination. The  
ruling allows “last hired, first  
fired" seniority systems to be main-  
tained.

The Justices also said that af-  
firmative action, which says that  
women and minorities as a class have  
been discriminated against, and there-  
fore deserve preferential treatment  
to overcome years of bias, are in-  
valid. From now on, “affirmative  
action" benefits would be limited to  
an individual who could prove a  
specific employer discriminated  
against her or him because of sex or  
race or both.

Assistant Attorney General William  
B. Reynolds, who has fought for this  
ruling said, according to an AP story  
by Michael J. Sniffer, "(the decision  
was) wide enough (to affect the pri-  
vate sector as well as public employ-  
ers and) very definitely has ramifi-  
cations with regard to hiring and  
promotion." Government agencies will  
be told not to use any quota system  
for hiring, promotion or layoffs,  
based on sex or race.

Information for the above was obtained  
from the Buffalo News
