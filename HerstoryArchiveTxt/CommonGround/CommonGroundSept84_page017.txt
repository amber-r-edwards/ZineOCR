Coalition for Abortion Rights and  
Against Sterilization Abuse  

GET INVOLVED  
TO PROTECT  
YOUR RIGHTS  

WHO WE ARE  

CARASA is a group of feminist activists  
who advocate women’s right to safe & legal  
abortion & who work towards ending the  
abuse of sterilization in this country &  
worldwide.  

CARASA has been actively working to  
counter the small but well-organized anti-  
choice movement & its right wing backers.  
However, CARASA is more than a pro-choice  
group. We view the right of women to safe &  
legal abortion as part of a broader & more  
fundamental spectrum of reproductive  
freedom.  

WHAT YOU CAN DO  

BECOME A MEMBER OF CARASA.  
CARASA now offers four types of member-  
ship: Active Member; Organizational Af-  
filiate; Individual Affiliate; or Sustainer.
