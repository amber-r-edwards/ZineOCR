= Abolition and Temperance movements, as well as the culmination of years of agitation for ‘women's rights', as far back as the 1770's, with Abigail Adams at her plea to her husband and the founding fathers to call up support at all these levels of this country for recognition for women in the Constitution. Whereas it is a popular notion that the movement for women's rights collapsed after the passage of suffrage for women, and that there was no follow-through among women's organizations in the political arena. The impressive history and present prominence of the 130,000-member League of Women Voters, organized into 1,300 local Leagues, belies that notion. Formed in 1920 by Mrs. Carrie Chapman Catt and other members, the League believes that this is the major source of the League's strength, along with its grassroots women's organization and multilevel organization. Members are encouraged, as individuals, to go and lobby their legislators.

"Perhaps the greatest myth about the League of Women Voters is that we only register little old ladies to vote. What people don’t realize is the League is concerned with issues at all levels...The League identifies reliable solutions." These include: Affirmative Action, Vocational Education for girls, Day Care availability, Flexible working hours, Protecting the Food Stamp Program, Financing of Education, Re-apportionment, Reagan Budget Cuts and Block Grants, and Public Policy on Reproductive Choice, among others.

THE LEAGUE TODAY Research, history and background, and possible solutions and actions on issues and laws are presented in various publications. "Report from Washington" details many current issues in Washington, and "Action in Albany" reports on New York State actions. These publications give specific information, bill numbers, status, and a "What you can do" section if you want to take some personal action. These are some of the best informational publications around. The League also sponsors debates and forums, and recently presented an eight-part series on television for public education. They hope to have a local T.V. station carry the League's Gubernatorial debate sometime in late October.

WOMEN AS A POLITICAL FORCE When asked whether or not women had any particular political power, especially in terms of voting and the elections, Ms. Photiadis and Ms. Banks felt they could, if they would exercise it. "Recent polls show there is a difference in how women feel versus how men feel (on some issues). Women seem to identify certain issues, especially military spending. (There is a statistical difference for the first time," said Ms. Photiadis. She went on to say, “In Erie County, women are enrolling more than men, and women who do enroll, enroll Democratic. The second largest category (of citizens) are non-registered and the third are Republicans.

The American Suffrage Movement, which ‘officially' began with the first local women's rights convention in 1848 in Seneca Falls, N.Y., won the right for women to vote with the passage in 1920 of the 19th Amendment to the Constitution. Women's political organization was an outgrowth of women's participation, organization, and political education in the

is not simple majority nor is it unanimity, but refers to the overall "sense of group" as expressed through the exchange of ideas and opinions. The word describes both the process and the result.

Writing your Representative: Telling it to Washington, Albany or Local Officials

Highly paid lobbying aside, an elected official serves at your pleasure as a citizen and voter, and if you let your representatives know your views, they are likely to take them into consideration. The sheer volume of mail for or against an issue can determine how a representative will cast her/his vote. It takes a willingness to become informed and then to communicate your decision to your Rep. If you don't bother to let them know how you feel, then the lobbyist's job is made much easier.

The following are tips from various sources which will help you effectively communicate with your Rep on issues of importance to you!

#1. BE EDUCATED! Know the name and number of the piece of legislation or the popular name of the issue at hand. Know what your Rep's position has been.

#2. ORGANIZE! Get your friends to make a commitment too and share the responsibility. Have letter writing parties. Quick and solid response to an issue is very effective.

#3. DETERMINE TO WHOM AND WHEN your letter should go. Timing is important during early committee review and just before a vote.

#4. WRITE YOUR OWN LEGISLATOR and/or the committee chair and members of a committee when hearings are being held. If you don't know the name of your Rep, inquire at your local library or League of Women Voters.

THE LETTER

- It should be legibly written or typed and on your own stationery if possible. Include your return address and signature.

- Use proper salutation: Dear Senator, Dear Assemblywoman, Dear Mr. President.

- Use your own words. Form letters aren't very effective.

- Clearly identify the issue or piece of legislation. Only one per letter.

- Briefly and to the point state your position, why and how it would affect you, your community.

- Indicate specifically what you'd like your Rep to do. Don't be rude or threatening, you'll defeat your purpose.

- Show that you've done your homework, and that you know how your Rep has voted or her/his viewpoint.

- Offer more information or personal contact, especially if you're part of a group which would like to persuade your Rep. (It is sometimes more effective not to say in your letter "...I'm a member of...", because your Rep probably knows already how a group feels on an issue.)

- The personal touch is always best. Make the connection clearly between action on the issue and your quality of life.
