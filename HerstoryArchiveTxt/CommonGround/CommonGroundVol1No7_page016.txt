—— <= Polish American Oral History

EXCERPTS FROM AN ORAL HISTORY OF A
POLISH-AMERICAN WOMAN, COLLECTED
BY SOPHIE KNAB IN MAY 1982.

When I was only two years old my
mother died and there were seven of
us children. We had a farm and my
father was a stelmach...I don't know
how to say it in English but he was
making wagons and furniture and he
was teaching his boys the same trade.
And well, father got married to a
young girl and the children were
coming every year...he had seven
from his first wife and then started
having children by the second wife...
so there was no place for us...we
couldn't get along with the step-
mother. Naturally she's going to be
speaking for her own children and
care for her own children before she
cares for us so everyone who was
growing up to fourteen and fifteen
they were leaving for America.

I was the sixth child. When I
grew up to be fourteen, my brother
went to America to avoid the Russian
army and he didn't want to go because
we all hate the Russians...I didn't
speak Russian at all. I used to read
because my brothers were going to
school and when they came from school I
was following their lessons and then
I understood a little Russian but me,
I had to work on the farm and was
helping father to work in the field
...and I asked my brother “when you go
to America, will you send me a ship
card, papers to come to America?"
and he promised me because he always
felt sorry for me.

My brother came in 1911. And I,
I came in 1913, two years later...
my brother sent papers to my father.
I was too young to leave the country.
They give you permission to leave
the country and I was only fourteen
to have to ask “me to go to America"
and I came through Rotterdam in
Holland...I was waiting two weeks in
Rotterdam for my boat...that was
hard but I was that kind of person
that I was afraid of everything. My
father put the ten dollars in a bag
and hung it around my neck...ten rubles
not dollars. That's supposed to be
permission to let me go to America
because if you don't have money at
the time then they won't let you go
...you have to have some money.

On the boat there were other
Polish, Czechs speaking Polish and
there were Jews speaking Polish too.
But I was afraid of everybody. My
father told me I shouldn't get ac-
quainted with any boys, no men, not
even to sit down on the bench where
men sit there—don't sit down because
[otherwise] you're going to have a
baby—my father scared me that way.
Dumb.

At Ellis Island they did what
they had to do—examine us and
sterilize our clothes and things be-
cause that was the rule to do that.
And well, I came to Buffalo on the
train. I was walking home—I was
dressed up real nice because father
said, "Well you have to look nice in
America" so he bought me a nice skirt
and blouse, and I got dressed up and
combed my hair and as I walked the
boys were throwing stones at me and I
asked somebody why they were throwing
stones? “Because you are a greenhorn."
But I was dressed up nice. How
would they know I'm a greenhorn?

I came to my grandfather's place
like a poor orphan—no food, no sleep,
no bath. They put four chairs
together, put something on it and
I was sleeping like that at my grand-
father's in the kitchen. Well, any-
way, I had a sister in Hamilton,
Canada—she had come before. She
got married. And I wrote her that I
came to America. She was already
two years in Canada and she was work-
ing in the hospital in the laundry
and if I came maybe she could get a
job for me. So when I got there she
took me to the hospital where she

worked, Emma, and she looked at me and

said, "How old are you?" I said, "Four-
teen." I was going to be fifteen in
March and she said something to my
sister and she said to me “Emma says
she doesn't have right now anything
for you but we should keep coming in
--maybe she's going to have some-
thing for you." So I guess I was

there two weeks by my sister and there was
no job. She took me to some kind of
sewing factory with a Jewish man and
he was taking an examination from me.
He said, "Do you know something about
machines?" I said yes. I didn't
know anything about machines. He
said, “Well, I have an easy job for
you if you understand something
about machines—that was a man's
garment factory—you can sew pockets
for men's pants." He brought me a
bunch of pockets cut out and he
showed me how to sew around. I took
the machine and tried and the
machine got stuck. It didn't want
to sew. So I was trying and trying.
Then the needle broke down. So I
told the boss...he looked at me, looked
at me and said, “You go home, I
haven't too much to do. When I have
more orders I'll let you know." He
took the address and number. But I
knew he got rid of me. He didn't
want me. So I came home and told my
sister. She said, “Don't worry about
nothing. I have lots of friends
here. Boys, lots of Polish boys in
Hamilton." She was calling all the
boys she knew to come meet me. All
those boys didn't want to marry
Canadian or American girls. They
were all looking for Polish girls.

He came in. I was afraid of him
--he was talking so loud. I said,
"That's not the man for me...he was
twenty-two. But I think that he
must love me because he was coming
every day. And finally he intro-
duced himself and asked if I'd marry
him. I was afraid to say no because
what was my sister going to do? My sister
said, "If I'm going to bring some-
body I like and she's not going to
marry him, I'm going to throw you
out and you go wherever you want to.”

I didn't even know the next street.

Mike was working in the foundry
and he told me he's got two hundred
dollars savings because he was two
years in Canada already. And I said
I don't want to get married. He
said, "Don't worry about anything.
With two of us it'll be easier."

We went to church and the priest he
asked, "How old are you?" And I said,
"Fourteen—I'm going to be fifteen in
March." “You can't get married," he
says, “you're too young." But my
husband said, "Listen father - all
the girls will have you believing
they're young. Her sister is twenty-
two and she's twenty." And he be-
lieved him...well, anyway, we got
married. ...I got pregnant. When my
time came, I was in such pain, I
thought I was gonna die. The mid-
wife stayed overnight and the next
day. The case was complicated so
she called the doctor...I was young
...my first baby. I don't know why,
but the baby didn't want to come. I
screamed my head off and the baby
still didn't want to come...it was a
little girl. The doctor had to hit
her pretty hard before she started
crying.

And what else...well, we were
working and saving and the children
were born every few years...as I got
older I got smarter and was getting
along pretty good...I was talking

with a divorcee. We were talking
about love and things. I told her,
"I had eight children, I had a good-
looking husband. I don't know what
love is. He never told me he loves
me, I never told him I love him...we
were living...fighting...and making
up. He never beat me like some...
it was a pretty fair life....@

She sees shadows in taffeta dresses,
