Readings on Abortion Rights

compiled by Judith Geer

To stoke the fires of knowledge on
any issue it is necessary to
continually go to the literature.
Someone out there may come up with a new
angle which will help to elucidate a
given philosophy and the only way to
find that out is to read up on what's
available. The following books and
periodical articles concern the basic
issue of abortion as seen from both
sides of the issue. I hope to
construct bibliographies on more
specific points within the main topic
of abortion in ensuing months.

"Abortion" in OPPOSING VIEWPOINTS
SOURCES. DEATH/DYING 1984 ANNUAL.
St. Paul, MN: Greenhaven Press,
Inc., 1984.

OPPOSING VIEWPOINTS SOURCES contains

articles on many different social

issues. These articles express the
opposing viewpoints concerning those
issues, and they are generally very
fairly presented. This particular
volume contains 13 articles dealing
with opposing views of abortion. NB:

It is unfortunate that the editors of

OPPOSING VIEWPOINTS SOURCES chose to

include the articles on abortion in the

DEATH/DYING volume. They have since

put abortion articles into their HUMAN

SEXUALITY book.

"Abortion" in OPPOSING VIEWPOINTS
SOURCES. DEATH/DYING 1986 ANNUAL.
St. Paul, MN: Greenhaven Press,
Inc., 1986.

Five articles by different authors

giving opposing views of the issue.

"Abortion" in OPPOSING VIEWPOINTS
SOURCES. DEATH/DYING 1987 ANNUAL.
St. Paul, MN: Greenhaven Press,
Inc., 1987.

Four articles dealing with opposing

views of abortion are included.

"Abortion" in OPPOSING VIEWPOINTS

SOURCES. HUMAN SEXUALITY 1988
ANNUAL. San Diego, CA: Greenhaven
Press, Inc., 1988.

Three articles by different authors
giving opposing views of the issue.

"Abortion" in SOCIAL ISSUES RESOURCES
SERIES (SIRS). Boca Raton, FL:
SIRS, various years.

SIRS is a series of volumes on topics

of current social importance. Each

volume contains reprints of magazine
and newspaper articles from around the
country on various topics. Articles on
abortion appear in such volumes as

ETHICS, FAMILY, HEALTH, etc. No

article on abortion has ever appeared

in the SIRS DEATH AND DYING volume.

Callahan, Sidney and Daniel, eds.
ABORTION: UNDERSTANDING DIFFERENCES.
New York: Plenum Press, 1984.

Several essays on both sides of the

abortion issue with opposing commentary

by other authors are included in this
volume.

"Is Abortion the Issue?" HARPER'S, July
1986, p. 35+.

A fascinating discussion among four

women - 2 from each side - who expound

on their rationales and philosophies

concerning abortion.

Luker, Kristin. ABORTION AND THE
POLITICS OF MOTHERHOOD. Los
Angeles: University of California
Press, 1984.

Background on the moral aspects of

abortion, a look at attitudes in the

19th century, and future forecasts.

McLoughlin, Merrill. “America's New

Civil War." U.S. NEWS & WORLD

REPORT, October 3, 1988, pp. 22-31.
A long article relating several women's
and men's stories. Although both sides
are given, the pictures and placement
of interviewees' stories project an
anti-abortion sentiment.

Mohr, James C. ABORTION IN AMERICA.
New York: Oxford University Press,
1978.

The history of abortion in the U.S.

from 1800 - post-Roe. Mohr, a

historian, documents the reasons the

U.S. went from a nation with no

abortion laws in 1800 to one which

totally outlawed the procedure by 1900.

Muldoon, Maureen. ABORTION: AN
ANNOTATED BIBLIOGRAPHY. New York:
Edwin Mellen Press, 1980.

Much has happened since this volume was

published, but for a run-down of

"early" writings, this is good.

Sass, Lauren. ABORTION: FREEDOM OF
CHOICE & THE RIGHT TO LIFE. New
York: Facts on File, 1978.

An older volume (as far as this issue

goes today) filled with newspaper

editorials from around the country
concerning various facets of the

abortion issue. Good approach to a

historical insight into the debate.

Most of these books are currently
out of print and not available for
purchase. Check in area libraries if
you would like to read them.
