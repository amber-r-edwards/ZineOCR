Buffalo N.O.W.

by Christine Van Veghten

The NOW/NYS 1986 presidential elec-
tion process has been a complicated
one. This subject is of concern to
a number of Western New York women,
as Buffalo NOW members have received
a flurry of mailings on the subject
from various sources, and because
much of this issue revolves around
the candidacy of Nancy Fohl Castro,
President of the Buffalo Chapter of
NOW for the position of NYS/NOW
President.

The bare facts of the election
process are as follows: NOW/NYS
mailed requests for absentee ballot
coupons in the February 1986 issue
of the NOW/NYS "Action Report" to
members of NOW in NYS. Many responses
to this were from the Buffalo area,
and as all of these requests seemed
to be in the same handwriting, NOW/

NYS election officials became concerned.

They sent out letters to all from
whom requests had been received,
stating that "It appears that there
has been fraud in the form of appar-
ent forged signatures on requests
for absentee ballots," and requesting
verification of signatures from
individuals before issuing absentee
ballots. Nancy Fohl Castro withdrew
from the race, saying, among further
comments which will be elaborated
further in this article, that "[she]
was forced to withdraw as a candidate
rather than appear to condone or to
be a participant in this mockery of
an election." The election has now
been concluded, with Noreen Connell
being elected president.

A grievance has been filed to set
aside this election. This grievance
reads, in part:

“Article VIII, Elections, Section C,
#2 provides as follows: The Tally

Committee shall announce in an every
member mailing that an election will
take place at the NOW NYS Convention.

If any NOW NYS member cannot attend
the convention, s/he can request an
absentee ballot from the Tally Commi-
ttee in writing no later than 21 days
prior to the first day of the Conven-
tion." (Emphasis added).

Nowhere in the above by-law does it
say that the request must be signed

by the individual NOW member request-
ing the ballot. In fact, in previous
NOW NYS elections, signatures were
not required on absentee ballot re-
quest forms.

A Request for Absentee Ballot Coupon
was printed in the February 1986
issue of the NOW NYS Action Report,
and does not conform to Section
C-2 and C-3 of the By-Laws, nor was
the coupon submitted to the NOW NYS
Council for approval as part of the
election rules.

The Committee to Elect Nancy Fohl
Castro for NOW NYS President asked
and received permission from members
in person and by telephone to re-
quest absentee ballots in their names
so they could vote in the 1986 NOW
NYS elections. The ballot would be
sent by the Tally Committee to the
home of the individual NOW member.

A request on behalf of a NOW member

for a ballot to be sent to that NOW
member's home does not violate the
NOW NYS By-Laws.

(The By-Laws also say) "The Tally

Committee shall mail an absentee
ballot to all NOW NYS members who
request one; also two return envelopes,
one to be used as an outside mailing
envelope and one to be used as an
inside mailing envelope.

The Tally Committee violated this
by-law by failing or refusing to

send an absentee ballot to all NOW

NYS members who had requested one.
Instead of sending absentee ballots

in response to the requests, the

chair of the Elections Committee

sent a letter dated April 9,
days after the deadline to send out
absentee ballots for the April 19th
election, stating "It appears that
there has been fraud in the form of
apparently forged signatures on
requests for absentee ballots." This
letter with these references to fraud
and forged signatures intimidated some
NOW members from exercising their
right to vote. The Elections Commi-
ttee Chair announced at the NOW NYS
Conference that 387 NOW members (1/2
of those requesting ballots) who had
requested absentee ballots had not
responded to the request for signature
verification letter. Disenfranchis-
ing half of the potential voters does
not "preserve the integrity of the
election," which was the announced
intent of this letter from the
Elections Committee.

The Elections/Credentials/Tally Com-
mittee violated other by-laws by
failing to even send out the absentee
ballots until April 21, 1986, two
days after the start of the NYS
Convention on April 19. Not only
were the ballots not sent out until
after the NYS Convention, but the
ballots were not due back to the
Tally Committee until May 5. Addi-
tionally, NOW NYS Executive Vice
Presidential Candidate Fulmor

was notified recently that the
Elections Committee had failed to
extend the date for the rental of

the ballot lock box in time, resulting
in some unknown number of absen-

tee ballots being returned to
sender, thus eliminating more
votes.

There were many other irregularities
in this election. For other examples

follow... The election process was
so tainted that Candidate Castro was
forced to withdraw as a candidate
rather than appear to condone or

be a participant in this mockery of
an election."

The grievance is signed "for NOW,
Kathleen Jackson, Vice President,
Buffalo NOW; Chair, Committee to
Elect Nancy Fohl Castro; Nancy
Fohl Castro, President, Buffalo
NOW, Candidate for NOW NYS Presi-
dent and Katherine M. Fulmor,
President Middletown NOW, candidate
NOW NYS Executive Vice President.

Some local members of Buffalo
NOW contacted have indicated that
although they received a request for
verification of signature from
NOW NYS, they had never requested
an absentee ballot, nor indicated
an interest in having one requested
in their name.

Some other NOW members contacted
have also indicated that they feel
this grievance is not in the best
interest of NOW, saying that it is
silly for feminists to be fighting
feminists when there is so much
work to be done fighting common
enemies.

CG attempted to contact some
officials of NYS NOW for their
comment, but were unable to reach
these women, admittedly on short
notice.

CG hopes to report further to you
on this process of the grievance/sit-
uation in the September issue. Letters
to the paper on this subject are wel-
come, if any readers would like par-
ticular points clarified. The Buffalo
NOW phone number is 674-1544.
