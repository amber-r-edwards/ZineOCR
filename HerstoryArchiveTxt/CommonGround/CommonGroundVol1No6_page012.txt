SECOND HOME

Spring after spring

those Canada geese

--trails of smoke on the wing--
returning to stubbled fields

of wintered corn,

that sloppy landing

on wet furrows

patched with unmelted snow,
those calls announcing

paradise regained

had awakened a longing

for the faded streets of Havana
that no spring

would ever bring back.

this April

Mary

saddled up the tall bay and the mare,
and we rode

into fields of stubble

and wintered corn

disturbing a flock of geese

who took flight needlessly

over our heads,
Thoughts Flying out of Tehran, February 1981
and our horses shied.
I got busted
We broke but beat that rap
and cheated
into gallop and laughter, that grim reaper
bringing in a bloody harvest
yelled our war cries, in this place east
I'm leaving-- --
full speed the horses,
for one where little Emmett Till
grinned at the wrong wasp face
in Louisiana
and Miss Liuzzo
rode in the wrong car in Alabama
and forty-odd men at Attica
home perhaps, never made it back to the safety
of their cells.

home,

perhaps home

I sometimes think
at last. the electrocuting state
came down too hard
on Mrs. Rosenberg,
Olga Mendell making her sit still
just to make a poor Jew--her husband--
talk.

I'm luckier, Ethel:

I got nine months

and was just expelled
though I was accused
the same as you.
