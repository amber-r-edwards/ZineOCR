Jan. 17-March 2: The Albright-Knox  
Art Gallery is featuring "The  

Harriet Tubman Series," by one  

of the foremost Black American  
painters, Jacob Lawrence. He began  
this series of 31 paintings in 1939  
as part of the Federal Art Project  

of the WPA (Works Project Administration). The paintings are a celebration  
of Harriet Tubman, a freed slave  
who helped free many other slaves via  
the Underground Railroad. The series  
provides a much-needed addition to  
the mere lip-service given so few  
notable women by our male-dominated  
history.

Feb. 4-March 2: Another exhibit at

the achievements of 12 Black women  
in a wide range of disciplines.  

Award-winning novelist Toni Morrison  
has written her first play, entitled  
Dreaming Emmett. The play, a mixture  
of political and personal themes, is  
based on a real incident. In 1955,  
Emmett Till, a 14-year-old Black  
from Chicago, was beaten and shot to  

death while visiting Mississippi,  
apparently because he whistled at a  
white woman. The play premiered January 5 at the  
Capital Market Theatre.  

Morrison, author of Tar Baby,  
Sula, The Bluest Eye, and Song of  
Solomon, is currently a professor of  
humanities at SUNY at Albany.

WomenSpeak, a half-hour weekly radio  
program sponsored by U.B.'s Women's  
Studies, presents contemporary national  
and local issues of interest to women  
and the WRFO listening audience.  

The program explores issues that  

affect women and their lives. Women  
are given little opportunity to speak  
in today's world, and more importantly  
to be listened to. Women are exposed  
continuously to interpretation of  

their lives.  

Their problems and ex-  
periences that are uniquely their own,  
and understood by other women, often  
receive misinterpretation from sources  
other than their own voices. To give  
a balanced view of women's lives to  

a listening audience, WomenSpeak will  
give an in-depth view of a single  
issue during each program. The pro-  
gram will be a magazine style format.
