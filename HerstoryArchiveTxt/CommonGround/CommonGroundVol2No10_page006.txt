against genuinely severe side effects
--as through consumer protection
agencies, litigation or appeals

to the F.D.A.--may result in over-
kill: general vilification of the
concept of herbal health care and

its suppression.

Another woman at the 1983 work-
shop asked about the availability
in capsule form of herbs. The argu-
ment may be made that herbs in cap-
sules are a convenient means to
ingest a large dose of an herb at
once. We might also consider
whether this mega-dosage is an ac-
commodation of intrusive means:
Does it promote a deceiving sense
of immediacy and "relief"?

Dosage and side effects questions
are not easily answered and should
be, to this author's mind, answered
by each of us for ourselves, although
not in isolation. I do not believe
these questions are best answered
in a self-serving manner, that is,
by saying, “it's my life," and
letting things go at that. We
might instead learn for ourselves
about these matters; examine our
feelings about the process of self-
protection undertaken; share our
feelings/findings with each other;
ask individually/collectively if
we are indeed protecting ourselves,
and if not, why not? At least ini-
tially, this process will generate
more questions than answers.

Because of the need for our involve-
ment in the process, filling the
need may offer more self-sufficiency
in the long run than currently
available short run measures.
There's more to, say, Solomon's

Seal than meets the eye. Solomon's
Seal is also known as Lady's Seal,
and doubtless, there's more to it
than that!

NUCLEAR WAR:
One Woman’s View

Dr. Helen Caldicott

by Mary Anne Coyle

On May 4, 1984, Dr. Helen Caldicott
announced her diagnosis: the planet
is terminally ill, it is infected
with thousands of microbes--nuclear
weapons. Dr. Caldicott, President
Emeritus of Physicians for Social
Responsibility and founder of Women's
Action for Nuclear Disarmament, in-
formed the audience that we have only
six months to save the patient, for
in November we will elect a new
Congress and President who will de-
cide whether to let those microbes
fester and grow, or whether to treat
the malignancy by adopting a policy
of rapid bilateral disarmament of
our nuclear stockpiles.

As part of Peace With Justice Week,
Women's Action for Nuclear Disarma-
ment sponsored Dr. Caldicott's pre-
sentation at Erie Community College.
Her announced intentions are to
spend most of 1984 on the road for
W.A.N.D., encouraging Americans to
use the democratic process and to
elect a Senate, Congress and Presi-
dent who will reverse the current
insanity of the nuclear arms race.
Her comparison of the voting process
in her native Australia to the
voting process in America openly
challenged the audience to review
the democratic process here and
our attitudes towards it. While
voting in Australia is compulsory
(there is a fine for not voting),
27% of the American public elected
Ronald Reagan. Although class dis-
crimination has been a part of the
history of voting rights (only white
propertied males could vote in
America's infancy) we must acknow-
ledge the vote to be a privilege
and use it as a responsibility, and
supervise the actions of our repre-
sentatives. Few politicians are
threatened by anything other than
their political survival. An in-
formed democracy will behave in a
responsible fashion: they will know
their representatives' voting record;
they will have contact with him to
let him know that they are informed
about the issues; they will campaign

and vote against him if he is not
responsible to them.

Helen Caldicott tells us that the
problem is that America has lost its
soul. We are of Judeo-Christian
tradition which orders us that "Thou
shalt not kill." Yet we have an
articulated policy and have had
since Robert McNamara's years as
Secretary of Defense in the early
60s of overkill. We have enough
bombs to kill each Russian forty
times. Scientists, enamored by
technology have said that Adolf Hitler
is "technologically sweet." Sci-
entists have succumbed to psychic
numbing: they see, hear and think
nothing about the uses of what they
have created.

Caldicott tries very hard to make
people know that war is obsolete; it
means the end of the world. She
does this by explaining the effects
of just one bomb on a geographic area.
One bomb equals twenty megatons of
TNT, twenty times the total amount
dropped on Hiroshima. Upon impact,
a human being will be vaporized

because bodies are 80% water;
people will be caught in hurricane
gales of 500 m.p.h.; everything
within a 6 mile radius will be leveled.
Twenty miles away, people will be
desperately burned; everyone will
die in acute pain. Forty miles away
people will be blinded by the heat.
Their eyes will melt. Flash fires
will spread. We cannot practice
pre-nuclear thinking attitudes which
suggest that we make more and more
weapons which will wipe out
life as we know it on this planet.

"But what about the Russians?"
"But what about the Americans?"
Caldicott asks the standard questions.
The Russian leaders are old, they are
frightened. America's allies
include Britain, France, Germany--
world powers. Russia is surrounded
by hostile nations; they have no
friends. Dr. Caldicott suggests
that we temper their paranoia by
making friends with the Russians as
we did with the Chinese when Nixon
initiated détente. China was the
Red Peril, the same description we
use for Russia. We began trading

with them and our perceptions of
them changed. If we begin trade
with the Soviets, we can have a
moderating political influence
because their economy will be affected
by our actions.

In Dr. Caldicott's introduction,
she told us that what motivated
her was love. She said, "I will
die free, but if I cannot preserve
this planet for my children, it would
not have been worth it.” 42% of the
public believes that Reagan will
bring nuclear war. Surveys show
that most children do not believe
they will ever grow up. One child
speaks: “Nobody likes a broken
present for Christmas. That's how
I feel about my life." Caldicott
urges us to “commit our lives, our
fortunes, our sacred honor" to
ensure the survival of the planet
and the human race.
