COMMON GROUND

FORUM:  
NAIROBI  

by Wendy Kellogg  

FORUM '85, held in Nairobi, Kenya  
paralleled the official United Na-  
tions Conference to assess the Decade  
for Women and was attended by well  
over 10,000 women representing hun-  
dreds of non-governmental organiza-  
tions. For nine days, in workshops,  
cultural events, films and informal  
networking, women shared and com-  
pared experiences of their work and  
studies related to improving the  
lives of women. Organizations re-  
presented at FORUM '85 work in areas  
of economic and legal inequality,  
the peace movement, poverty, women's  
health and education, violence  
against women, environmental quality  
and development in the third world.  

Many of us have attended con-  
ferences, rallies, music festivals  
and the like; we have experienced  
the tremendous power and learning  
that can take place when thousands  

of women are together. Coverage by  
American media did not give an accu-  
rate picture of the Nairobi meeting;  
I would like to share some of my  
experiences and thoughts as a parti-  
cipant with you.  

I think it is often difficult  
for those of us born and raised in  
the U.S. to understand the life  
experience of people in the rest of  
the world, especially what we call  
the third world. One of the most  
valuable aspects of Nairobi was the  
opportunity to learn from women  
something of what their lives are  
like; how their cultures shape the  
opportunities and constraints they  
experience because they are women;  
how they struggle to improve con-  
ditions for themselves and their  
families. There was a great deal  
of sharing and support at FORUM '85  
for women of all nations as women,  
not representatives of a particular  
religion, race or nationalist creed.  
The judgment by the American press  
that only political disputes and  
conflict are "newsworthy" items  
veils the predominant experience  
of exchange and learning. Many  
third world women have a legitimate  
complaint against United States  
foreign policy, which often supports  
regimes and aids policies which  
have directly added to the suffering  
of many women. However, I never  
sensed ill will toward the people  
of the United States.  

The themes of the Decade are  
Equality, Development and Peace. I  
thought it appropriate that the  
United Nations Conferences were held  
in Africa. The drought in Africa  
simply aggravated the long-term en-

Peace Ribbon Diary: August 3-4, 1985  

The Peace Ribbon was the inspiration  
of a 61-year-old former Chicago  
school teacher named Justine Merritt.  
Several years after visiting Hiro-  
shima and Nagasaki, Mrs. Merritt  
felt compelled to work for peace.  

She embroidered a piece of cloth with  
the names of all the people she  
would miss in the event of a nuclear  
holocaust. Her friends did the  
same and she began to hope for  
enough pieces to create a "ribbon"  
to go around the Pentagon. With  
the help of the national and inter-  
national news media, Mrs. Merritt's  
message went around the world. Peace  
panels arrived from the USSR, Japan,  
and other foreign countries as well  
as all over the U.S. The vision of  
wrapping the Ribbon around the Pen-  
tagon grew and eventually it was  
decided to include the Ellipse in  
front of the White House and the  
Capitol in the final wrap. The  
Washington-based Center for New  
Creation worked out the logistics  
of the wrap and over 15,000 people  
participated in the August 4th event.  

Peace Ribbon Diary  

Peaceful, Powerful Action  

I phoned a friend, Nancy, who lives in  
Washington, and she agreed to meet  
us for lunch and a trip to the Na-  
tional Air and Space Museum. Over  
lunch Nancy expressed the same re-  
vulsion about our present Federal  
administration as I have felt for  
so long. She wondered aloud if we  
were the only people who felt this  
way. I told her to come to the Rib-  
bon wrapping the next day. Events  
like that are so important if for  
no other reason than to give heart  
to continue; to let us know we're  
all out there witnessing.  

4 p.m.: Michele and I arrived at  
the National Cathedral for a Peace  
Service. The church was filled to  
overflowing when we entered. Over  
every chair was a piece of the Ribbon  
and pieces of it were wrapped around  
the huge stone pillars and carried  
by two lines of people as part of  
the processional. When Justine Mer-  
ritt came down the center aisle the  
congregation gave her a standing  
ovation. Invocations of peace from  
many faiths were offered after which  
the minister turned to Justine Mer-  
ritt and said, "Well, Mrs. Merritt,  
I see you've brought some of your  
friends with you this afternoon."  

The atmosphere in the church was joy-  
ful and exuberant. There seemed to  
be a radiance or perhaps a hopeful-  
ness that was almost palpable and  
built with each hymn and certainly  
with the poetic words of Justine  
Merritt. "This Ribbon was conceived  
in fear, grief and rage," she said.  
She told us that we had been chosen  
to spread the feelings and ideas  
which inspired the Ribbon.  

Probably the most moving part of  
the service was the testimony of the  
two Hibakusha (nuclear attack survi-  
vors), a woman from Nagasaki and a  
man from Hiroshima. The woman talked  
of the radiation poisoning she  
had suffered and the two children  
born dead to her thereafter. The  
man spoke of the burns and paralysis  
which the bomb had caused him. Both  
of them pleaded emotionally for "No  
more Nagasaki! No more Hiroshima!"  
One could not listen to them without  
being strongly affected.  

The service ended with a spirited  
rendition of "Reach Out and Touch  
Somebody's Hand." The Ribbon was  
given a rousing send-off on the eve  
of its unfurling.  

6 p.m.: WAND held a reception near  
the Cathedral for its membership  
and we spoke with women from Chicago
