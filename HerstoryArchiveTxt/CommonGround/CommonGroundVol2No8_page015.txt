DAFFY’S TREE

{Editor's note: Once again Daphne has  
given in and let her sister Daffy have  
a crack at this column...so, here's to  

April 1st!}

Would you care to dilly, Daffy,  
with me? Here commences the vinegar.  
Taken in small doses, this recipe is  
sure to produce nifty results. Just  
infuse dill herb in cider vinegar.  
For purposes like these, you want to  
keep on hand wild, hardy dill which,  
by the way, greatly prefers a field  
of corn to a forest floor.

And get this! Dill derived from  
the Morse means "to lull" (dilla),  
bringing us full circle to the con-  
clusion of this introduction to dilly-  
ing with Daffy over Dill.

Let's be serious and quote Culpeper  
on the subject (dill). Quoting Cul-  
peper is always a sign of seriousness.  
Dill

“stays the hiccough, being boiled  
in wine, and but smelled unto being  
tied in a cloth. The seed [of dill]  
is of more use than the leaves [of dill -  
you've not forgot?], and more  
effectual to digest raw and  
vicious humours, and is used  
in medicines that serve to ex-  
pel wind and the pains pro-  
ceeding therefrom..."  
Seed of dill is pungent and potent,  
seemingly curious characteristics for  
the offspring of an herb noted for a  
lulling quality.

Domestically sown in drills, this  
fruit of the Dill’s may have needed  
more Selma Freiberg and Dr. Spock and  
less Real Women Don't Pump Gas and  

Real Men Don't Eat Quiche. Either  
that, or less Freiberg and Spock and  

More Real Women, Real Men. Which  
one depends on a lot of things.

If the foregoing be  
your cup of tea—and Daffy for one  
can readily understand why it wouldn't  
be; Daphne's astonished to think  
it might not be—for another cup of  
tea, crush the aromatic dill seed,  
infuse, and serve hot with violet  
sherbet.

Dill, incidentally, is a member of  
the carrot family. A carrot is an  
orange vegetable, too easily peeled.  
You might invite carrot, dill's cousin  
over for tea and sherbet. With re-  
bellious offspring—and what else  
are we to expect of a fast-growing  
annual such as dill?—peer pressure  
often works best. Keeping in mind that  
seed of wild carrot (Queen Anne's-  
lace) is, like seed of wild dill,  
useful in remedying flatulence, but  
in this case, avoid the root. The  
seed of wild carrot "mends what the  
root marreth" [Culpeper again (if  
you're wondering, a seventeenth cen-  
tury astrologer-physician and author  
of the Family Herbal)].

To be for once brief, and re-  
turning to peer pressure, too much  
of a good thing is too much. Still,  
if it's ménage à trois you're after,  
carrot, dill and violet sherbet are  
an unbeatable combination. (Daffy  
simply will not recommend corporal  
punishment. Neither will Daphne.)

Dillying along here, and more or  
less getting down to dill, The Eng-  
land's Doctor claims, "One quality  
thereof yet blame I must,/ It makes  
men chaste and women fills with lust.  
Tsk. So much for dillying. In fact,  
as Mary Poppins has often said, "A  
tisket, a tasket, a green and yellow  
basket." And, dill is green and  
yellow. It comes with large umbels,  
(flower clusters) too, which look  
enough like baskets for us to dilly-  
dally a little longer here.

It's not a bad pot plant, either.  
Of course, if you're drying the stuff,  
Daffy recommends paper bags—much  
better than baskets for catching  
seeds. But, we were dallying over  
women's lust (see Mary Daly, Pure Lust  
Beacon Press, 1984, (available at  
EMMA soon), not paper bags—although  
to be on the safe side, Daphne  

suggests number eight bags, the size  
in which most, but certainly not all  
people pack their lunches.

Now that that's out of the way,  
and lest we forget, dill is a counter  
charm ritually gathered by Druids.  
Surely you've not forgot? Druids are  
nymphs who come, complete, with tree  
spirits. This is Daffy's tree you're  
reading! Priestesses all, these  
nymphs worship the moon goddess.

Getting back to the Norse, we are  
looking specifically at the World Ash  
Tree Spirit, Yggdrasil. Ygg's giant  
shoulders hold up heaven and earth,  
not to mention (although Daphne will)  
Midgard and Asgard. (Daffy told you  
so...) Rearing offspring sometimes  
feels like Ygg’s burden. But, as  
women's lust is our focus, we'll  
worry about the kiddies later. Actu-  
ally, in this context, given men's  
chastity (see supra), we're not going  
to worry about kiddies at all. What-  
ever destiny we weave with this  
counter-charm (dilla), it's not that  
one. Granted, in Norse lore, the moon  
is assigned a masculine gender, but no:  
one need get hot and bothered about it.  
Only when neither moon nor sun  
view will Druids gather dill. This  
is Ygg, not moon, we're envisioning,  
along, of course, with dilla. (You've  
not forgot?)

OK. Conjure an “image deep  
within a sacred grove" (Merlin Stone,  
Ancient Mirrors of Womanhood, II,  

p. 148). Imagine "the root that was  
kept alive/ by the magic waters of the  
well of Urth” (ibid., p. 151). Imagine dilla.

Imagine divination; imagine healing:  
imagine mystery: imagine long shadows.  
Imagine the deep, ever-running well.  
Imagine Ash: "Nine bandages it bears,/  
and as they each disjoin (as custom  
will)/ a mighty jug of ciders brought/  
with brandy mixed to elevate the  
quests" (Brund, Popular Antiquities).

Imagine cider; imagine vinegar;  
imagine cider vinegar; imagine dill.  
What did I tell you? Umbelliferous  
dill. Crisp, blooming dill. Self-  
seeding dill. Forget the drill.

You're home free.

Breast-feeding

Last August, a local woman breast-  
fed her 7-week old baby while she and  
her husband dined in a Buffalo area  
restaurant which is part of a well-  
known chain. Because she was, accord-  
ing to the Buffalo News, “ordered to  
leave [by the manager] who told her  
health regulations prohibited breast-  
feeding in the restaurant," she later  
filed a complaint with the state Div-  
ision of Human Rights.

Recently, a settlement was reached  
through the mutual consent of the  
restaurant and the woman. She not  
only received an official letter of  
apology, “from the restaurant chain,  
they also paid her $250.00, reimburs-  
ed her and her husband for their meal  
that day, and gave them cards for  
several free meals.

The woman stated that she had been  
feeding her baby "quietly and unob-  
trusively," and that the manager's  
action “turned an otherwise discreet,  
natural and unremarkable event into  

a public scene, holding me up to rid-  
icule and embarrassment, and causing  
me to experience shock, humiliation,  
and mental anguish."

Finally, it should also be noted  
that as a result of her formal com-  
plaint, the chain issued a policy  
statement to its employees and manag-  
ers throughout New York State in-  
structing them that breastfeeding in  
any of their restaurants cannot be  
prohibited.

WOMEN FIREFIGHTERS

Not one woman out of 108 who took  
the Buffalo firefighters Civil Service  
exam was able to qualify for the posi-  
tion, causing much furor and charges  
of discrimination.

The Buffalo Common Council is  
scheduling hearings to determine  
whether the test for physical agility  
was skewed to eliminate the women  
candidates.

Discrimination charges are being  
leveled at Michael L. Broderick, chair  
of the Civil Service Commission, on  
the basis that women have taken the  
test and qualified in the past. One  
member of the Common Council, James  
Keane, whose wife is presently a fire-  
fighter, said that the test did not  
measure requirements for the job.

He also said that if the old scoring  
methods had been used, nine women out  
of the 108 who were tested recently  
would have qualified for the job.

In the old exam, candidates were  
required to score 70 points on a  
combination of both the written and  
physical tests. On the new exam,  
candidates needed to score 70 on both  
parts of the exam. None of the women  
appointed in 1979 passed the agility  
exam. Two of the women who joined  
the Fire Department in 1979 won awards  
for heroism.

The attorney for the denied can-  
didates, William A. Price, is hoping  
to convince the U.S. District Court  
to invalidate the test by challenging  
the validity of the 1979 test. If  
the court rules in a favorable way,  
then the 1984 test is also invalid.

gave women the right to vote, they

Lillian Gilbreth, internationally  
recognized industrial engineer and  
mother of twelve will be commemorated  
on a 40-cent postage stamp. Gil-  
breth, known as the "First Lady of  
Engineers" is responsible for  
studies that encourage worker rest  
periods and improved working condi-  
tions. She died in 1973 at the age  
of 93.

A 17-year old mother in Pennsyl-  
vania has been dropped from the  
rolls of the National Honor Society,  
not because her grades are poor, but  
because she lacks “leadership and  
character". Arlene Pfeiffer, the  
student, is taking her case to the  
Human Relations Commission and the  
Equal Opportunity Commission.

A new publication, "Fertility  
and Pregnancy Guide for DES Daugh-  
ters and Sons” has been issued to  
let the eight to ten million indi-  
viduals know what other reproductive  
problems, aside from cancer, have  
been linked to the drug. For the

Young women who cease menstruating  
because of intense exercise, emo-  
tional stress or other reasons run  
a greater risk of getting osteoporosis  
(brittle bones) as they age, a  
recent study says.

A physiologist at the University  
of California says that the benefits  
of regular exercise far outweigh the  
risks of osteoporosis and that  
young women who stop menstruating  
should increase their intake of  
calcium by using supplements of up  
to 1,500 milligrams of that mineral.

Women are dying more frequently  
from lung cancer than from breast  
cancer, says a study from the Univer-  
sity of Texas. The leading cause  
of cancer deaths among women used  
to be from breast cancer. The  
change is attributed to an increase  
in smoking among women that started  
thirty years ago.

HOT FLASHES...HOT FLASHES...HOT FLASHES

...Are the members of the Buffalo Com-  
mon Council willing to call themselves  
just that? Currently, they are of-  
ficially referred to as “Councilmen,”  
which is no longer an appropriate term,  
since not all members are male.

On March 6, the new title was put  
to a vote. However, four of the thir-  
teen lawmakers were not in favor of  
changing the limited and inaccurate  
term. They were Council President  
George K. Arthur, Lovejoy Councilman  
Norman M. Bakos, Councilman at Large  
Clifford Bell, and Masten Councilman  
David A. Collins.

Meanwhile, the resolution will find  
its way to the desk of Mayor Griffin...

A 25-year old woman filed suit in  
Wailuku, Hawaii, when she was denied  
unemployment benefits after being  
fired. The state department of labor  
denied Laural K. Llewellyn benefits  
on the grounds that she had refused  
to adhere to the policy of the company  
she worked for regarding appearance.  
Llewellyn was fired after she refused  
a company order to shave under her  
arms, pointing out that shaved armpits  
were not required of male employees.  
Llewellyn worked for a charter boat  
firm as a deckhand.

After receiving a 36-year sentence,  
convicted rapist Daniel Delincino  
walked up to his victim on the way  
out of the courtroom and told her  
that he would "see you after my  
appeal." That threat prompted a Cali-  
fornia judge to add another 24 years  
to his original sentence.

Women in 114 countries receive  
more substantial maternity benefits  
and maternity leave than American  
women, says a study conducted  
by Columbia University. The re-  
searchers polled 250 American com-  
panies and found that 72% of these  
allow women to take unpaid leaves  
of absence between 2 and 3 months.  
A woman who wants more time risks  
losing her job.

Only 40% of the employed women  
in this country are entitled to a  
six-week paid disability leave at  
childbirth. Women who depend on  
vacation and sick time often end  
up with less than a month off.

The study also notes that larger  
companies and high-tech companies  
do a better job with maternity  
leave benefits.

In Europe, a five-month maternity  
leave is the average, and these  
countries guarantee a woman's job.
