HARAMBEE BOOKS

CODD LON LS NL LD a She

By E. R. Mann

Harambee Books is a tightly packed  
bookstore located at 1377 Main Street,  
Suite No. 3, in Buffalo. This small  
business is also a thriving center of  
African and African-American culture,  
with more than 500 titles dedicated  
to preserving and enriching the lives  
of Third World peoples.

Sharon Holley, and her husband  
Kenneth, started Harambee out of a  
commitment to their community, and  
as a natural outgrowth of their  
politics. This very busy couple  
put much of their time and energy  
into the support and growth of the  
Black community in Western New York.

Politics aside, what Sharon and  
Kenneth did was start a small busi-  
ness with little more than faith  
and hard work. And, like many who  
own their own businesses, they have  
struggled with the bills, keeping  
the store open, searching for  
material they want to carry, and  
“making do" creatively with what  
ever resources they possess. Sharon  
agreed to tell CG her story in the  
hope it might inspire others to  
“take the plunge". The following  
is an edited version of the interview.

CG: How did Harambee start? 

SHARON: It's always been a com-  
bined effort between Kenneth and I.  
When we first thought we were going  
to do it, we were dating. We al-  
ways liked books and bookstores.  
We would visit bookstores in other  
cities and buy a lot of books...  
usually two copies--mine and his.

We had a lot of duplicate copies  
of the same book! So we started  
talking about opening a bookstore  
together. We wrote letters asking  
people how it was in the business,  
and generally talked to people and  
figured out whether or not we  
could make a go of it.

Of course, the big thing we  
needed was capital--we didn't  
have it! I think we even opened up  
a joint account somewhere to start  
saving money to put it together.

CG: When did you first open, and  
where did the name "Harambee” come  
from?

SHARON: The name? It means “let us all  
pull together", in Swahili. It  
started as Harambee Books and Crafts  
in about 1975 - 76. The books that  
we bought, we set aside in one room  
of our house (we were married by  
then), and we put shelves up and  
began to stock books and when  

there was a community event, we  
would go out and do "set ups" [where  
we sold merchandise]. If people  
wanted particular books, we'd bring  
them to them.

Friends would come to the house.  
But then, you just can't leave your  
house open for people who want to  
buy books! So...we decided it was  
getting a little tight as more  
and more people heard about the  
books...

After that, we decided we'd better  
look around for a storefront.  
We've probably been at 1377 Main  
Street since 1977. We had a small  
amount of stock, [people knew about  
us] by word of mouth, and we had  
short business hours. Even now, we  
have to close down some afternoons  
and do set ups at programs and events,  
a lot of times out of town.

CG: What kind of material do you  
carry?

SHARON: When we first started we  
knew we couldn't compete with large  
chain stores. We didn't have the  
capital to do that, so we just took  
the special market in African and  
African-American material. We put  
our efforts into concentrating on  
that. Those things were not avail-  
able in the city of Buffalo in any  
quantity...You just couldn't go to  
a bookstore and find a wide selec-  
tion of books. We thought we'd  
just take this market, and so far  
it's been pretty good.

CG: Do you also still sell crafts?

SHARON: Well, the crafts depended  
on what I was doing. Then the babies  
came...and I still have a room full  
of craft supplies! Now we have lo-  
cally created Black paper dolls, and  
we have some prints and posters lo-  
cally produced, and some things we  
have been able to pick up from out  
of town.

CG: Do you consider what you are  
doing an “alternative business"?

SHARON: I'd say yes, because when  
you talk to people from the larger  
chain bookstores, they want to  
sell what makes money, and they  
usually stock a lot of what is on  
the best sellers list. Very seldom  
will you find a book by an African  
or African-American author. That  
is not to say they aren't being  
written and read. We did find  
some in what they call "Black  
literature" sections, and I found  
the material there often de-  
meaning; really showing no purpose,  
or not historically correct. I  
hate to call it trashy, but...

it's just this one aspect of Third  
World literature that is being  
carried.

There's so much more people need  
to be exposed to.

So, to answer your question: it is  
an alternative to what you'd ex-  
pect to find in a chain bookstore.

CG: Who comes into the shop?

SHARON: We get a mix. Some students,  
parents, teenagers--and a certain  
group of folks who always come by  
to see what's new. And a group of  
first time customers, especially  
around the holidays, looking for  
gifts. They want a real nice book  
that makes a strong, positive role model for  
the child.

We carry children's books; child-  
ren's records. Also cards, primarily  
note cards. There aren't very many  
Black-oriented cards. We carry  
magazines, a few adult records,  
poetry, fiction...African religion,  
African/Black political ideology and  
games and puzzles.

We also act as a resource in the  
Black community. People call us and  
ask what's going on, what there is  
to see and do. We also sponsor a  
speaker's service. We bring people  
in to read their work, or to speak,  
for slide shows and cultural ex-  
changes.

...In the future, we'd like to ex-  
pand. For instance, the Buffalo  
Hispanic community is poorly repre-  
sented with material in stores,  
and maybe we could carry material  
of interest to them.

CG: What is the greatest barrier  
you feel there is to a woman starting  
her own business?

SHARON: I think it is a psycho-  
logical one. You have to love what  
you're doing. You can't just do it  
for a fast buck. It's a lot of  
hard work and very long hours if  
you're going to be in business for  
yourself. If you listen to those  
people who are in business admini-  
stration, they may say you have to  
have $50,000 to start a business.

They tell you you need this or  
that to make it work. If you  
listen to them, and wait until you  
have all those things, then you'd  
never get it started! If those MBAs  
had looked at Harambee, they'd say  
"You can't possibly do that".

But we did! ©
