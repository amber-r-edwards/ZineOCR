The First Test

by Bonnie MacGregor

She walks into my classroom,  
shoves her purse and books under  
the chair, and takes her seat.  
With a sudden motion, she grabs  
her purse again and fishes for a  
pen and some tissues that she  
lays neatly on the desktop.  
Quietly, she shoves her purse--  
but not the weight of the test--  
under her chair.

The rest of the class enters  
and takes their seats, but she  
really never notices them. Time  
and again she glances back and  
forth between the clock (impa-  
tient for the time to come and go)  
and at the third finger on her  
left hand (she rubs the indenta-  
tion that has been left by a now-  
missing wedding band.)

I hand out the empty answer  
sheets and wait while everyone  
completes the heading identifica-  
tion for the test; then I walk  
around the room and hand each  
person their copy of today's  
questions. I stop at her desk  
and quietly encourage her not to  
be so nervous, that it is--after  
all--just a test. My smile, I  
hope, is reassuring.

I know, however, that for a  
woman who has been away from  

Living With the Knowledge

school and tests for over 15  
years, this is an absolutely  
terrifying day for her. She  
may not have really slept last  

night; she probably has overstudied;  

she may be feeling so anxious that  
she has had nothing but a cup of  
coffee for breakfast which will  
sour her stomach; and that she  
really feels guilty about all of  
this school stuff and for not  
spending more time with her kids  
instead of with her homework.  
What I know that she does not,  
however, is that there are many,  
many women who find themselves in  
the same situation--that divorce  
or separation or job layoff may  
mean adjustments in both a new  
marriage status and in becoming  
the sole breadwinner and central  
focus of the family. This situa-  
tion can be temporarily strained  
even more if the woman chooses  
to get some education before enter-  
ing the job market, because it  
brings the fears of parenting to  
a new level of guilt: is she  
ignoring her children and being  
selfish in pursuing this school-  
ing and doing homework and study-  
ing for tests? How can she tell?  
I watch as she begins the test.  
Her body curls tightly with her  
feet wrapped firmly around one  
of the legs of the chair. She  
grips the pen as if her life de-  
pends on how hard she holds it--  
maybe it does.

Under a Cloud of Mushrooms, Children Play

by Diane Waterman

For as long as I have been  
aware, some thirty years now, I  
have been conscious of the near-  
ness of nuclear annihilation.  
Punk rockers do carry on about  
it. There is no reason for hys-  
terics. It started before I even  
went to school, around 1954. We  
used to have air raid drills in  
the Village of Kenmore every week.  
On Mondays, the powerful air raid  
sirens would howl like death  
through the streets. There was  
no escape from the sound. I felt  
like my lunch would come up,  
hiding under the bed in terror.  
Is it safe under the bed? Where  
was there to hide, when I could

theoretically become instantane-  
ously charred to dust in a matter  
of seconds?

All through grade school,  
various teachers led us through  
dark school basement corridors  
and made us put our small heads  
in our hands against the dented  
old cold gray lockers, or hide  
under our yellow varnished desks,  
crouched on the floor dusty with  
chalk, counting the black heel  
marks. I have been nose close  
to the smell of institutional  
floor wax, my person a tiny and  
vulnerable one. The world seemed  
contaminated. Pictures of skulls-  
and-crossbones flashed in my mind.  
My child's brown eyes grew sad  
beyond their years. Early on,  
the furrow between my brows had  
a head start on forming a deep  
gash. Every day of my life was  
lived with the knowledge of its  
fragility, that a flower an eye  
a hand a dog could be made to not  
exist in a wink. Did I have the  
right to grow up?

I admit that I live with  
chronic anxiety, that a disaster  
will befall me before I become  
grey and wise. Mostly wise.

The Bomb? I hardly think about  

it anymore. Bomb toss is now a  
game for the aging men of politics.  
My mind has grown old thinking  
about it. I can no longer per-  
ceive every day of my life as  

the last day.

Twenty-five minutes or so go  
by. She relaxes just a bit, and  
looks again at the clock. She  
has plenty of time left and she  
has finished her test. I wonder  
if she will begin to do what many  
other students do in rereading  
the test: change answers from the  
right ones to something illogical  
just because there is more time  
left to do so.

She puts down her pen and looks  
up at me. I motioned to her that  
it is all right if she wants to  
bring me the papers, and watch  
her face turn crimson as she walks  
toward me gripping the test and  
the answer sheet.

I take the test paper, and hand  
her a marking pen and my answer  
key. "You look as if you can't  
stand the wait until tomorrow to  
see what your grade might be," I  
say, "so why don't you check your  
paper here at my desk right now."

She tenses up again and looks  
at me with a bit of disbelief and  
terror. She then takes the pen  
and my test key and begins to look  
her answer sheet over. I watch as  
her color returns to more normal  
as she goes further and further  
down the columns of answers with  
very few checkmarks accumulating.

A smile--a real smile--fills  
her face as she hands me the  
papers. "Only 4 wrong," she says,  
“which should be a 92% if you don't  
find anything else. I guess I  
really passed the test."

She has; you know. “Not only  
the one I gave her about the con-  
tent of the course, but the one  
she gave herself about being able  
to try and strive for a better  
education and then a better job  
and maybe a better life. This  
first test seems to be the first  
step, and she has succeeded.

I meet her time and again  
every semester that I teach.  
Sometimes she is tall with lots  
of dark wavy hair, sometimes she  
is rather stocky with short crop-  
ped blonde hair, but she is always  
in my class and she is always so  
full of fear and anxiety and hope.  
Although my job is to teach the  
content of a course on the new  
office technology that will get  
her a well-paying career, I also  
find that I am mending her self-  
image and building her self-worth  
and training her about risks.

Her looks may change, but as long  
as there is divorce or job layoffs  
or change in family status, she  
will always be in my classes.

And when she smiles at me after  
having passed that first test, I  
am always so proud of her ambition  
and hope and ability to take this  
risk of education. I know that  
she is a survivor, and after that  
first test, she knows it, too.
