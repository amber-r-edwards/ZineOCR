Divorce: Equitable Distribution  
in New York State  

by Maria Ceraulo  

On July 19, 1980, the New York  
Equitable Distribution Law became  
effective on divorce actions on or  
after that date. The new law pro-  
vides for equitable distribution of  
assets/property acquired during the  
marriage. To understand how this law  
affects women, Common Ground inter-  
viewed Peter J. Fiorella, Jr., a  
recognized specialist in marital and  
family law, and his assistant Ross  
Runfola.  

"Under equitable distribution,"  
notes Fiorella, "all the property ac-  
quired during the marriage now be-  
comes marital property for the courts  
and/or attorneys to divide." Pre-  
viously, each spouse was entitled  
only to property/assets specifically  
held under his/her name. This tended  
to discriminate against non-working  
wives and mothers.  

Legally, women are entitled to  
compensation for their role as wife,  
childrearer, and homemaker. Her  
duties probably helped her husband's  
career or career potential. "She  
has made his life more comfortable,"  
says Runfola, “and he's been able to  
deal with his job while she, in a  
traditional marriage role, takes care  
of the children."  

Some additional factors in deter-  
mining an equitable distribution a-  
ward are: the duration of the marriage  
and the age and health of both par-  
ties; residence; loss of inheritance and/or  
pension plans upon dissolution of the  
marriage; the probable future fi-  
nancial circumstances of each party;  
and any direct or indirect contribu-  
tion in acquiring marital property,  
by the non-titled spouse.  

Prior to the new law, recalls Fi-  
orella, "if a woman was guilty of cruel  
and inhuman treatment or of adultery,  
she could not receive alimony or pos-  
session of the family dwelling, even  
if the court wanted to give it to her.  
If the husband was guilty (of either)  
it didn't make any difference. The  
standard was unequal. She was pun-  
ished and he wasn't and she was pun-  
ished severely. That has changed.”  

The Legislature decided that a  
judge can, using his/her discretion,  
penalize for either behavior, but  
it is no longer automatic.  

In some cases, equitable distri-  
bution may work "against" a woman.  
Until 1980, the husband was required  
to pay his ex-wife alimony until her  
remarriage or death. This sometimes  
discriminated against men who paid  
alimony until they were 65, even  
though the wife may have been self-  
supporting or capable of becoming  
self-supporting. The Legislature  
decided to allow the courts to set a  
"rehabilitative maintenance" period--  
that is, the necessary time period  
for the spouse to go into the job  
market and become self-supporting.  

The alimony payments continue  
for this time period.  

The age of the children (if any)  
and other factors are taken into  
consideration. "It can certainly be  
tougher for her to work," explains  
Fiorella. "By the same to-  
ken, if the children are 13 and 14  
and there is no reason for the wife  
to be home, the Court may award her  
a one-year maintenance period" for  
her training and entry (or re-entry)  
in the workforce. The court has the  
option of not reducing her payment  
during this period or reducing it one  
dollar for every two dollars she  
earns.  

According to Runfola, "part of a  
rehabilitative maintenance plan could  
include tuition for a woman with a  
high school diploma seeking a college  
degree. This means she is no longer  
dependent on the husband financially  
or for self-identity."  

If the couple acquired a business  
during the marriage, the Legislature  
devised a distributive award. Run-  
fola explains "the Courts have decid-  
ed they don't want the couple to be  
divorced from the household but still  
partners in the business." If the  
wife is entitled to share in the  
business, a value is placed on the  
business. The husband pays this to  
her over a specified time period.  
Since the award is separate from  
maintenance, it is tax-free to the  
wife.  

Fiorella and Runfola note that  
even when women are able to claim  
long-term payments from their  
spouses, they discourage it. One  
of their goals is to help women  
become in control of their lives  
during a divorce situation and  
maintain that independence. Both  
attorneys agree that a  
client must be honest about her  
situation so that all options under  
the new law can be explored.
