ROBIN FLOWER BAND TO APPEAR at Tral-  
famadore Cafe April 17-Led by  

strong picking Robin Flower on the  
guitar, mandolin and fiddle, this  
all women quartet performs their own  
upbeat arrangements of traditional  
country/bluegrass music and original  
songs--footstomping music with an  
added touch of social conscience  
and compassion.

In the title song from More Than  
Friends, Robin Flower's first album  
release, she gives us a love song  
that celebrates the beauty and im-  
portance of sharing friendship with  
those you love. Going a step fur-  
ther, she proudly proclaims to the  
world: "Oh how I love her/She's my  
oldest friend/...By the way we love  
each other/You can tell we're more  
than friends".

"Go for the Good Times" is a  
rollicking country tune on her first  
album that honors the philosophy of  
the Kentucky hill people in her own  
background. She passes on their  
philosophy that it's best to "go  
for the good times, let ‘em roll/  
Cause if you wait til tomorrow you  
may find/Your motor just won't go."

As a musician and a songwriter,  
Robin Flower reflects the strength  
of women. The performances by Robin  
and the rest of her talented quartet  
are powerful, defying the typically  
limited role of women as singers only  
in the world of bluegrass music.

Don't miss Robin Flower's first  
Buffalo appearance at the Tralfma-  
dore Cafe on Sunday, April 17 at 8:30  
pm. Tickets are $4 in advance,
