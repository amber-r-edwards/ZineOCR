COMMENTARY:  
Primary Shows  
Gains for Women  

by Susan Clements  

When the presidential ticket of  
Mondale and Ferraro went down to defeat  
in 1984, many political commentators  
were quick to announce a crushing  
setback for women in politics. The  
results of the September 9th Primary  
seem to say it just ain’t so.  

Women are seeking political office  
in droves. So many female candidates  
won primaries, in fact, that the  
national media has had to sit up and  
take notice. The ladies who were  
supposed to give up on dirty ‘ole  
politics and return to the hearth have  
simply refused to go away, and are now  
giving a lot of male candidates a run  
for their money.  

In two states, voters are being  
faced with an entirely new kind of  
race, one that pits woman against  
woman. While all-female races have been  
known to happen on a local level, this  
is the first time such contests have  
emerged on the national scene since  
Margaret Chase Smith ran against a  
female candidate for Senate in the  
fifties.  

Nebraska's gubernatorial race has  
received quite a bit of attention, as  
Republican Kay Orr goes up against  
Democrat Helen Boosalis, the former  
Mayor of Lincoln.  

In Maryland, incumbent Barbara  
Mikulski faces a challenge from  
newcomer Linda Chavez, a former White  
House aide who confounded the old boy  
network of the Maryland GOP by  
unexpectedly winning the primary  
against a more established male  
candidate.  

In both Maryland and Nebraska,  
voters will be forced to examine both  
candidates on experience and issues,  
since they cannot vote for “the man" or  
"the woman". This kind of race is  
healthy for women in politics. Such  
campaigns can be run with little or no  

attention paid to the issue of gender,  
and one would hope that these attitudes  
would spill over into other male/female  
races.  

The women running for office this year  
cover the whole spectrum of political  
ideologies, from traditional democrat-  
liberal to neo-conservative, post-  
feminist right wing. One thing is  
certain, however. After this November's  
election there will be many more women  
in our local, state and federal  
governments. And it's about time.  

Incidentally, I think that Gerry  
Ferraro should try again one of these  
days. Though she was burned,  
politically and personally in the last  
election, she established herself as an  
attractive and viable candidate who  
garnered a large popular following.  
When she appeared at the Buffalo  
Convention Center in November of '84,  
the emotion generated in that crowded  
room was astonishing.  

Ferraro has proved herself to be an  
able legislator and a dynamic speaker.  
She unfortunately took the heat for  
being the first female candidate for  
national office.  

During the campaign, Ferraro was  
muzzled by male campaign advisors who  
wanted to avoid her being perceived as  
"shrill" (heaven forbid they should  
notice she's a woman!) This was  
especially evident in the debate with  
George Bush, where she seemed as if she  
were holding everything back. I really  
wish she had let ‘er rip, and blown old  
“let's kick some ass" George Bush right  
off the stage.  

When women candidates are no longer  
advised to disguise and downplay their  
femaleness, we'll know we're really  
getting somewhere.  

LETTERS  

Dear Common Ground:  

I have to admit it--I do not  
understand the current local obses-  
sion with having babies. Don't get  
me wrong--contrary to what some  
of my friends might say, I do not  
hate children--but the mere thought,  
glimpse or faint wail of a baby will  
cause the most miraculous transforma-  
tion of some of my heretofore intel-  
ligent, mature and stable friends  
into goo-gooing idiots.  

I've known friends to sneak into  
the maternity wards of hospitals to  
gaze at nondescript bundles of  
someone else's joy. Women who  
wouldn't get out of bed before 10  
a.m. on a Saturday unless the house  
was burning down are on the road  
at 7 a.m. just to have the privilege  
of baby-sitting for a friend's child.  
For free.  

Out of foot lockers and from  
under beds, my childless friends  
will produce a most fascinating  
collection of toys, books and other  
toddler gew gaws when graced with a  
child visitor. If she is lucky,  
the child's mother will get a  
vague "Oh, hello" and be waved on  
in the direction of the kitchen,  
while her child is whisked away  
into her hostess's fantasy land.  

I have a friend who waxes eloquent  
about how soft and cuddly babies  
are--much better than a dog or cat  
(to which she is allergic anyway).  

Women who can't stand loud music,  
the telephone's ring and who swear  
at cars with bad mufflers smile  
howls at full volume in a restaurant.  

I have friends and acquaintances  

Dear Common Ground:  

Some days are discouraging.  
You pick up your Common Ground,  
with wonderful new typesetting and  
layout, interesting topics and the  
crucial element of woman-supportive  
businesses to patronize. So what  
is discouraging? Halfway through  
an article which seems firmly in  
the "fact" area of journalism I  
run into an editorial aside: "In  
fact, since I've never received  
food stamps, but have always resented  
food stamp recipients who purchase  
fancy frozen dinners, shrimp and  
other expensive items I can rarely,  
if ever, afford, I've been especially  
impressed by the amount of control  
over W.I.C. food items."  

This "in fact" reminds me of a  
lot of other ones. Like, "Although  
in fact, I've never been faced with  
an unwanted pregnancy, I'm sure that  
the women who are shouldn't have  
the right to choose abortion." Or,  
"In fact, my parents were able to  
support me through college, but I  
think that work study students should  
be paid less than minimum wage.  

After all, all they do is sit in the  
library." Or maybe, "In fact, I  
don't know any homosexuals, but I'm  
sure they shouldn't be parents."  

Being "on the dole", as we used to  
say, is tough. At the very least it  
involves placing your bills, I.D.,  
and the birth certificate of your  
children on the desk of some harassed  
bureaucrat who decides whether you  
are needy enough to get help. But  
it usually involves more--landlords  
who discriminate against you based  

who chart their moons, take their  
temperatures, devour child-rearing  
and child-producing books, join sup-  
port groups, and otherwise spend a  
great deal of time and energy trying  
to get pregnant and have a baby.  
Those who don't want to actually  
bear or raise a child troll the  
community looking to get acquainted  
with and make friends with those  
who do, or who already have kids.  
There's a baby connection out  
there where the name of your friend's  
boss's aunt on her husband's side  
who is rumored to be pregnant gets  
circulated to dreamy-eyed pseudo-  
aunts who crave an introduction.  
All well and good. But ladies,  
really,--babies grow up! I know  
it is a shock, but indeed, it is  
a proven fact that the baby stage  
only lasts about 2 years. Those  
who delight in toddlers must realize  
that the stage of development of  
which they are so fond only lasts  
a couple of years at most. Then the  
little darlings start having minds  
of their own. They Talk Back.  
They throw temper tantrums. They  
hate school. They start dating.  
They want to go to Harvard. They  
want a big old fashioned wedding.  
I'm not sure if any of my  
really hooked baby-junky friends  
will heed my gentle warning. But  
if I can save just one poor innocent  
soul from starting down that road  
into baby obsession, I will be  
gratified. And to all of those  
others out there like me who have  
never been able to speak words of  
moderation and reason to your friends  
for fear of being labeled a true  
philistine--or worse--take heart,  

Beth Mann  

on your source of income, periodic  
evaluations of your case, your bud-  
geting and your parenting--and food  
stamps.  

Having food stamps is wearing a  
big yellow star that says "Decide  
what I am permitted to eat." As  
soon as you produce your booklet  
there is a ripple, like the line in  
a Busby Berkeley musical, as the  
people behind you crane to see what  
you buy. Buy cake mix for your kid's  
birthday and the woman behind you  
sniffs. Buy frozen food you can  
cook in a toaster oven because you  
don't have a stove--the purist 3  
carts down grumbles into his zucchini,  
and so on....  

If we, as a country, as feminists,  
support programs to feed the hungry,  
to shelter the homeless, to educate  
the ignorant, we should not demean  
our gift by choosing their tastes,  
their neighborhood or their beliefs.  
People on food stamps are not our  
children or our property, and it  
is no more our business to judge  
the contents of their stomachs than  
it is to judge the content of their  
wardrobes, their politics, or their  
sex lives. Let's leave our criticism  
for the society that pits child care  
against healthcare and freedom of  
speech against women's safety, and  
not buy the lie that what one of  
us has threatens the rest of us.  
What threatens us is not what we  
have but what we lack.
