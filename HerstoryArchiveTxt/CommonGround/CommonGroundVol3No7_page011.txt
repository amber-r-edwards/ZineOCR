A pattern of stones  
streaming down the hill spines  
bring us together.  

Q  

I loved your mother, village wise woman, before you.  
Her shreds of nourishment arrive with you.  
What luck that she in her wisdom,  

honed keen to the bone,  
tucked-in severity,  

Gave you what little flesh she could.  

She brought you the last step from village to town.  
What luck the bones in their wisdom  

bore you out beyond the trees to watch me leave,  

to make my journey into the hills.  

When I meet your mother on the path,  

I will comb her hair smooth  
and she will not know me.

The Trouble Is  

The trouble is  

that even as my shadow  
sweeps the  
into the corner,  

I am singing.  

I sing as the moon sings,  

day's last sun  

sowing fields of stars;  
the song of the earth, warming.  

I sing as the stream,  

joining the river;  

as the root, shaping life from soil.  
To the night  

which casts its ashes in my path,  

I sing:

Things To Come  

In restaurants, I watch them  
the mothers that untie bonnets  
and straighten fine satin ribbons  

canvas shoes  

or retie those tiny  
you know, the ones with  
canvas bottoms  

In stores, I wish I had  

a reason to buy Gerbers  
Johnsons  

to worry if  

Luvs are dry enough  

I'd even buy  

those little plastic things  
that go in electric outlets  

I do buy  

bars of white baby soap  

in their glossy white wrappers  

I say it's because  

they're good for scenting dresser drawers  
I've collected 15 of them now  

From the window  

I watch my neighbor  
gathering round plastic toys  
from the lawn  

bright handles and wheels  
The baby at three  

has been very busy  

I see a fist full of grass  
dirt creasing his knees  
the easy angle of her hip  
beneath his weight  

I fall asleep at night  
thinking how she bought  
Ivory soap for his bath  
It floats, she said  

now he can  

find it himself  

in the tub

"Equality Day 1984," by Anne Montes  
Amphitheatre at Epidaurus  

I sent you  

up those ancient steps  
climbing to vertiginous heights.  
Then, amid the babble  

of other voices,  

I uttered one secret word.  
And you heard me,  

in a victory salute.  

O, we felt immortal then,  
privileged heirs  

of some old Grecian god.

The Gleaner  

John, the wind has shifted  
west to north  

these flakes are working up  
a storm  

she says, and pulling on  
a sweater ravelled  

by the years  

and field-mice  

hurries out to  

strip the garden  

before dark  

kneeling  

fills her apron  

with winter squash  
and onions  

feeling summer  

slip through fingers  
with the soil.  

Warm, keep warm  

till April |  

she says to no one there  
but snowflakes  
blanketing the cornfield  
whitening her hair...  
feeling in her bones  

the coldness  

feeling in her bones  

the aging  

of the year.
