GLCC AUCTION

Open since April of 1982, the Gay
and Lesbian Community Center (GLCC),
is located in a small storefront at
97 Rhode Island Street (off Niagara
St. near the Peace Bridge). The Center
houses a telephone information service
and provides space for meetings, work-
shops and small gatherings. Volunteers
staff the Center on Monday, Wednesday
and Friday from 7 to 9 p.m. and Sat-
urday from 2 to 4 p.m. An answering
machine provides information on up-
coming events and records messages at
other times. A newsletter further pro-
vides information about the GLCC to
over 600 people. On Friday nights
people drop by the Center between
7 and 10 p.m. for a casual evening of
cards, games, coffee and refreshments
with friends and new acquaintances.
Larger social events for the gay
community are sponsored by the GLCC
and help raise funds to maintain the
Center. Membership dues and donations
are the only other source of funds.

GLCC is holding its second annual
auction on Saturday, April
16 at the Unitarian Church on Elmwood
Avenue. Individuals and businesses
are donating items and services for
sale at this auction. The proceeds
will be used to maintain the various
community services of the GLCC.

The GLCC is currently soliciting
donations of saleable items or ser-
vices for the spring auction, which
will hopefully be a major fund raiser.
Volunteers with vans, trucks or cars
are also needed to help transport
donated items to the Unitarian Church
or prior storage locations.

If you have something to donate,
please contact the GLCC at 886-1274.
Arrangements can be made to pick up
and store them ahead of time if
necessary, so if you're moving or
cleaning the attic, please contact
the GLCC about anything you might be
getting rid of. Leave a message if
no one is at the Center and your
call will be returned.

RAPE LAWS

Four Erie County legislators are
sponsoring a resolution that requests
an immediate change in the language
of the new New York State penal law
dealing with rape. Mary Lou Rath,
(R-Amherst), Joan Bozer (R-Buffalo),
Shirley Stolarski (D-Buffalo) and
Marie Richardson (R-Hamburg), are
asking the state legislature to make
the new rape law less ambiguous and
open to interpretation.

The new law, passed by the 1982
legislature, stated that a rape victim
has to swear that she was in danger
of losing her life before succumbing
to rape. The former law stated that
a woman had to prove that she put up
a fight to prevent rape.

The new law has already been used
against women trying to press rape
charges.

POSITION ADOPTED

...the League of Women Voters, by
national consensus, has adopted a
position on abortion for women. The
one sentence statement says: "The
League of Women Voters believes that
public policy in a pluralistic so-
ciety must affirm the constitutional
right of privacy of the individual to
make reproductive choices." This
statement brought one of the highest
levels of agreement among league
chapters of any question in recent
years...

ABORTION RULING

Health and Human Services Secretary
Richard Schweiker said that he
has forwarded a final rule to the
Office of Management and Budget re-
quiring federally funded clinics to
inform parents when issuing birth
control devices to women under age
18. Within hours of the announce-
ment, Planned Parenthood Federation
of America filed suit to overturn
the ruling in district court.

Proponents of the ruling say that
parents have the right to know about
prescriptions that may have medical
effects on their children. Opponents
have dubbed it the "squeal rule"
saying that it would cause more
teenaged pregnancies because it
would prevent young women from seeking
birth control.

Schweiker has also begun im-
plementing a plan to transfer birth
control programs from career employ-
ees to a division run by an appointee,
probably Marjorie Mecklenburg. She
holds a strong anti-abortion po-
sition.

The new rule would require that
clinics inform parents by certified
mail within 10 days of prescribing
birth control devices or pills.

The teenager would be warned in
advance of parental notification.
There would be a waiver of notifi-
cation if it could be determined that
such notification would be harmful
for the young woman. Parents
would not be notified if a young wo-
man received counseling, information,
or non-prescription contraceptives.
Nor would they be notified about
drugs for treatment of venereal
disease.

VIDEO GAMES

Video game manufacturer Gamesource
has discontinued production of an
"adult" video game called "Custer's
Revenge" that shows a nude Custer
sexually attacking a Native American
woman. The game was vociferously
denounced by feminist and Native
American activists as racist and
sexist. A company spokesman said
that the "game came to symbolize rape
and racism in the eyes of too many
people."

VATICAN SPEAKS

...the new canon law code released
by the Vatican has given women more
rights and responsibilities in the
Catholic Church, but has maintained
the ban against women priests, per-
manent lectors or acolytes. The new
canon code has been under revision
for twenty years and reiterates
"that only baptized men can become
priests."...

...the Reagan administration has
charged that most pension plans il-
legally discriminate against women by
paying them smaller benefits than men
receive, because women live longer
than men. Solicitor General Rex Lee
told the Supreme Court that this
practice is in violation of the
Civil Rights Act of 1964, Title VII,
which prohibits the basing of
different monthly pension benefits on
tables showing different life ex-
pectancies between men and women...

...teenaged daughters are becoming
important decision-makers for house-
hold purchases, said a recent poll by
Yankelovich, Skelly & White. The
survey discovered that teenagers
have a large say in purchases because
their mothers are working and the
daughters are involved in mainten-
ance of the home...

...A federal appeals court in Rich-
mond, Va., has overturned a lower-
court decision that maintained the
Olin Corporation had the right to bar
women from certain jobs with toxic
chemicals that may cause damage to
a fetus.

The Olin Corporation policy re-
stricted women's access to certain
jobs because of "sound medical
evidence" that exposure to the chemi-
cals involved could endanger a fetus.
The appeals court decided that the
burden of proof is on the company to
show the risks to unborn children,
and that restricting women's jobs
eliminates those risks...

...the Supreme Court of the United
States will decide an issue of
pregnancy discrimination against
men this spring. The issue is wheth-
er employers may give the wives of
male workers less medical coverage
than the husbands of female workers.
The federal case involves an em-
ployee of Newport News Shipbuilding
& Dry Dock Co. The wife of a male
employee received $500 toward a
$1,900 maternity bill. The hus-
bands of female employees get 109%
medical coverage, and female employ-
ees get full maternity coverage.
The Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission says this is unlawful
sex bias...

...there's a new guide for “real wo-
men" -- “Real Women Don't Pump Gas:
A Guide to All That is Divinely Fem-
inine" by Joyce Jillson. Her obser-
vations include: Real Women do not

volunteer work, and the hobby of a
Real Woman is locking herself out of
her car ... [real women must be all
thin, white, rich and never know
where the gas tank is, who is she

...Ridge Tool Co.'s 1983-84 cal-
endar is causing an uproar. It fea-
tures scantily-clad women and the
various tools and pipes that the com-
pany sells. Says the advertising
director "[we are] promoting the
same thing the feminist movement
promotes, and that is freedom of
choice." According to local feminists,
"It's the same old thing: Using women's
bodies to sell things which have
nothing to do with women..."

...even Charlie seems to be settling
down. According to a story in the Wall
Street Journal, Revlon, in launching
its new Charlie commercial, is follow-
ing today's trend among women to want
the romantic, soft and feminine ways.
Charlie's out of her tuxedo and gold
lamé pants, into a pink, strapless
dress, and appears to be falling in
love. The perfume of the "women's
movement" seems to be going tradition-
