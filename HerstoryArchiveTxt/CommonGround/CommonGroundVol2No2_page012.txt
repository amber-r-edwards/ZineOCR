IN LIGHT OF REAGAN'S VIEW OF

VOLUNTEERISM, AS WELL AS THIS ADMINISTRATION'S CUTBACKS
IN SOCIAL SERVICES, HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT THE FACT THAT

SO MANY VOLUNTEERS ARE WOMEN?

WHAT ARE THE

POLITICAL IMPLICATIONS OF THIS?

Terri Friedland, Buffalo:

“To be honest, I don't know the
statistical background to this. It
would be important to me to know the
percentage of women who are volunteers.
My problem with this issue is that the
need for social services is obviously
there, and not to answer that need
doesn't seem to be the answer to femi-
nist issues either.

I've done volunteer work, and I
believe that everyone I worked with
were women. But the political im-
plications of this are obvious. My
major consideration politically is
that volunteer forces have always
been women, for example, in hospitals
and in community services, and any
reversion back to that becomes com-
fortable for men in the working force.

For me, I would rather put my en-
ergy into fighting Reagan's cutbacks
rather than into social services. My
fear is that women will abandon the
fight against Reagan's policies, and
will instead join volunteering, which
would be abandoning the primary issue.”

Fran Thomas, Buffalo:

"I think that volunteerism is a
middle-class norm, allowing women to
escape from the house on the pretense
of volunteering. We're trying to es-
cape male dominance by volunteering.

So many women aren't allowed to work,
but we're expected to volunteer."

Anonymous, Buffalo:

"In the past, women volunteered
for a variety of reasons. Many of
them had a lot of time on their hands,
especially older women whose children
were either in school or had grown up.
And these women were probably at
least middle class, and so could af-
ford to do volunteer work. Women
also volunteered as a possible step-
ping stone into a job.

I think that women are not only
allowed but also encouraged to
volunteer because in that capacity,
they pose little threat to men. They
do a nice, 'safe', activity, and are
still financially dependent on their
men.

Reagan's cuts in social services do-
not hurt the typical women volunteer
nearly as much as they do the poorer
women with large families who don't
have the leisure time to devote to
volunteering. Instead of asking for
volunteers, I'd like to see Reagan
ask for a return to higher spending
for social services."

Anonymous, Depew:

"Well, a large part of the popu-
lation is women, and I think it's
great that women are volunteers. Of
course, this is related to the large
percentage of women in the popu-
lation. Also, society has always en-
couraged that women be more caring,
and feeling, and that kind of atti-
tude is what social service organi-
zations need.

To volunteer for something, you
have to have a caring attitude. I
don't mean to say that men aren't
caring; it's just that they have
been brought up not to share that part
of themselves as easily as women have
been."

Anonymous, Buffalo:

“Nowadays, many women are the bread—
winners in their families. I think
that women are volunteering to work
their way into jobs. Also, women
who volunteer their services often do
so to experiment in a field to see if
that's what they really want to do.
For instance, I'm majoring in psy-
chology, and I plan to volunteer at
Children's Hospital, to get a taste
of what it's like.”

Marie Robinson, Buffalo:

"I think basically in the past,
volunteers were women. Women weren't
the breadwinners, and I guess they
had the time in order to volunteer.

I think the reason why there are so
many volunteers now is because of the
lack of jobs. With Reagan's cuts,
organizations rely heavily on volun-
teerism. I think a man can put up
with a woman as a volunteer (for ex-
ample, a woman as a fundraising ex-
ecutive for a large organization)
more than if she were an employee.
Perhaps she couldn't get a paying
job because of the job discrimi-
nation that women face, but she could
be a volunteer.

I think basically that women are
very caring human beings, and they
are more sensitive to people's prob-
lems; that's why we volunteer in the
first place."

June Sedarbaum, Buffalo:

"Through history, jobs with pro-
fessional status have changed. I think
some of the changes in status of these
jobs have changed with the influx of

IF ANY, ARE THE

women into the work force; clerks to
bank tellers and midwives to doctors
are two examples. Predominantly male-
dominated jobs have more status and
are considered more professional today
than, for example, volunteer work
(which is mostly dominated by women).

Reagan's view and the cutbacks seem
to me to create even a larger gap be-
tween the feelings and attitudes a
person has as a professional and as a
volunteer worker. The feelings and
attitudes toward themselves and their
relation to this planet are different.

Politically, this gap, once again,
reminds us of where our government
wants the role of women to be in the
social strata. The implications of
women dominating the professional
jobs are too much for our structure to
sustain, obviously since the ERA
failed.

The large paid-job cutbacks in
social services are necessary to be
performed. Through history, women
have been called in as volunteers for
these jobs in times of crisis (like
in wartime) and now is no exception.
Women are once again filling a crucial
role for no pay.

Some people suggest that this is
an opportunity for women to work up
the social strata ladder. Other peo-
ple question why it is necessary for
women to start at the bottom of the
ladder as volunteers. The differ-
ence in attitudes is partly acquired
by people's feelings about their work
and others' attitudes toward their
work. Professionals, laborers, and
volunteers are classes apart.

I really wish that Reagan would be
more considerate (at least) of others
besides professionals with his atti-
tudes. I fear for women, families,
and a large majority of our country
if this man is re-elected. We need
help. Something needs to be done to
straighten out this mess."

QUESTION FOR DECEMBER: RECENTLY, THERE
HAS BEEN A CONTROVERSY OVER A SEX-EDU-

CLUSION OR EXCLUSION AFFECTS TEENAGE
