Dear Common Ground,

In the last three years, a major
educational breakthrough has exploded
in Western New York, and it is be-
coming a magnet for national atten-
tion.

EPIC--Effective Parenting Infor-
mation for Children--represents the
first time the family, school and
community have united to prepare
children to become responsible adults.
Its purpose is to prevent child abuse
and neglect, teen pregnancies, ju-
venile crime, drug and alcohol abuse
and other self-destructive behaviors.

EPIC has developed and piloted
the first comprehensive parenting
educational model in the country.
There is a school curriculum which
is reinforced by complementary work-
shops for parents that are led by
trained volunteers. During a three-
year pilot program, the EPIC Pro-
gram has been incorporated in the
public school system of Buffalo and
a number of public and private
schools in Western New York. Thir-
teen hundred teachers have been
trained; 25,530 students have par-
ticipated; EPIC staff has trained
610 community volunteers who have
logged 14,000 service hours in lead-
ing 300 workshops for 3,500 parents.

EPIC is a non-profit organization
and receives a large portion of
its funding from donations. To con-
tinue our success, we must turn to
people like you... concerned parents
and responsible adults... who recog-
nize the vital necessity for con-
tinuous effective parenting--not
just for the children and their
parents, but also for the entire
community.

Won't you make a generous contri-
bution and send it today? Your
100% tax deductible donation will
be put to work immediately helping
to raise responsible parents of
tomorrow.

Sincerely,

Robert L. Wilson
President

POETRY CORNER

EVE

Walking naked in Paradise,
once proud & free;
Mother of two sons,

- one slain

- one a murderer,
tempted by the Snake's
silken promises,
now broken,
With the sliver
of white fleshy fruit
caught in your throat
& the core rolling bitterly
in the dust.

-Aline Lawrence

Her 6 A.M. smile
softens

the frost-covered city
melting

winter's icicles into pools
reflections
visions of Spring.

CALL FOR
MATERIAL

Common Ground has applied for an
Arts Development Service grant to
produce a special Arts Issue of Common
Ground in March of 1985. The ADS grant
will enable us to give a small honor-
arium for submissions we accept for
publication in that one issue, and to
produce a performance night of selec-
ted authors/artists whose work we
publish, to be held in mid-April, 1985.
A panel of local writers and artists
will help select the material and
performers.

Kess will be the name of this

March 1985 issue of the newsjournal.

We are calling for material from Erie

County that captures the essence of

women's various perspectives. We are

looking for material that actively
expresses women's participation in

the world.

Deadline for submissions is December
31, 1984. We are looking for original
essays, short stories, excerpts from
longer works, fiction, humor, poetry,
arts criticism (dance, music, visual
art, performance art, reviews), musical
lyrics, black and white photographs,
dramatic works, graphics (high contrast
black and white) never previously
published.

We will also consider a prospectus
for an article on an arts event/review
which would be impossible to complete
due to the earliness of our deadline.

We are also looking for artwork for
the cover of the issue which best
conveys the theme of the issue.

Material not selected for this
special issue may be held for publi-
cation in another issue under our
regular selections/submissions policy.

In addition, we will select several
authors/artists to be invited to read/
perform/exhibit at a special evening of
entertainment in mid-April. Those
selected will be offered an additional
honorarium.

DEFENSES

Entering
the world stripped naked;
we immediately begin
to clothe our vulnerability,
hiding behind masks,
woven of silk
and stainless steel -
Masters of Disguise:
Doomed to spend a lifetime,
searching for the one
true lover
whose vision will pierce
the fiercely-wrought armor
with that sudden sharp rush
of recognition;
acknowledging the quivering
naked self within.

-Aline Lawrence

Our selections panel reserves the
right to accept or reject any material
submitted for this issue. They may
also choose to hold over any material
for another issue unless the author/
artist indicates she does not find
this acceptable in a cover letter at
the time of submission. The selections
panel will edit for spelling, grammar
and punctuation. The panel may also
ask the author/artist to edit her own
work, with the panel's suggestions,
but in this case it is the author/
artist's responsibility for changes
in her own work.
