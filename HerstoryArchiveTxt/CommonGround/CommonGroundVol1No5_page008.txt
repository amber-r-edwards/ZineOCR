i do wonder  

why i am not angrier  

for if you are twice  

i  
tho i  

but one is supposed  
to get to it all  

& if we don't laugh  

insulted  

am too  
in different ways  

or nod docilely  

we have no sense  

so pushing aside  

sense of humor  

bruised sensibilities  
becomes a learned response  

it is not in our genes  
or our sexuality  

but it is trained into our nature  

til it only bleeds inside

SKIN-TIGHT WOMAN  

I'm a skin-tight woman  

full of fat chances,  

a skin-tight woman  

itching at the seams to get out.  

I'm a skin-tight woman  

grabbing the earth with my toes,  

a skin-tight woman  

I'm a  

skin-tight  

woman  

hanging on for dear life.  
= - = eee ae Pe ns,  

skin-tight woman  

with her days snipped off,  
a skin-tight woman  
thick in the middle.  

I'm a skin-tight woman  

whose mother left her body  
crumbling in a heap  

like something on the back porch.  

I'm  
and  
I'm  
and

"WOMEN AND FICTION"  

Maureen Brady, (Give Me Your Good  
Ear, Folly), and local writer Ruth  
Geller (Seed Of A Woman, Pictures  
From The Past), were brought together  
December 4 for a "Women and Fiction"  
reading of their works to the wo-  
men's community. About 25 women  
attended an evening of entertainment  
and discussion at the G.L.C.C.  

Buffalo writer Ruth Geller, who  
has just finished her third book,  
read from her essay in Nice Jewish  
Girls, an anthology of writings from  
a feminist-political perspective, by  
and about Jewish women and culture.  

Ms. Brady read from Folly, her  
recently released novel about south-  
ern working class women during a  
strike at the local mill, racism, re-  
lationships and loving between women.  

COMMON GROUND  

a skin-tight woman,  

everyone is growing up around me.  
a skin-tight woman,  

I ain't gonna hang around  

the rain.

Both women's writings are direct,  
sensitive and humorous, and display  
a talent for exploring issues in a  
way that leads the reader to a great-  
er understanding of the things that  
separate -- and the ties that bind--  
women.  

Women writing fiction from a  
woman-identified perspective bring  
a sensitivity to the complexity and  
diversity of women's lives. Much  
recent fiction has focused, in part,  
on exposing and de-mystifying the  
parts and truths of women's lives  
which are ignored. Good feminist  
writing has all the qualities of  
good novels, but presents women and  
women's concerns in a realistic,  
positive way.
