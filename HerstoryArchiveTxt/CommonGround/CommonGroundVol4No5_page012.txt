Potpourri from p. 5

ing inside me renewed my belief in
God. But by the time this child
was a toddler, my mother, who had
been the guiding force behind my
religious upbringing, questioned
the very existence of God as she
died a slow, painful death from
cancer. Her cynicism shook me
deeply.

Family pressures and the old
Catholic guilt moved me to have this
child, and my next one four years
later, baptized. Otherwise, I
stayed away from the church until
my older child approached age 5.

It was then time to decide whether
to introduce religious beliefs at
home, and to choose a school. I
could procrastinate no longer. I
opted for a Catholic school for
him, not so much for the religious
training as for the quality of edu-
cation. But could he face nuns for
9 years without observing rules of
Catholicism at home? - Now I was
forced to participate in his reli-
gious training.

Knowing I could not be comforta-
ble in the very traditional parishes
in my neighborhood, I shopped around.
Was there a church devoid of gold,
marble, and other trappings of opu-
lence? Was there a church where
money was not the constant subject
of sermons? Was there a church
where women had an active and vi-
sible role in both liturgy and de-
cision making? Was there a church
where you didn't have to force your
children to sit still and be silent
for longer than humanly possible?

Some acquaintances in a very
active organization called Task
Force on Women and the Church (see
article in Dec. CS) suggested one
of several area Newman Centers.
Their recommendations were based
particularly on the fact that New-
man priests tend to be more open-
minded and usually use inclusive
language, that is, language that

includes women, in both the li-
turgy and their sermons. Correct-
ing language bias is one of the few
hard-fought battles against the
Catholic Church that has been won
at some levels.

Occasionally we go to Mass at a
local Newman Center, and it does
satisfy many of my needs. A nice
sense of community exists among the
people who attend, and there is also
a very strong commitment to social
issues around the world. Activist
work is often done, from a local to
an international level. The sin of
sexism has even been given a little
lip-service during sermons; this is
a mere beginning, yet one I never
dreamed of hearing from male priests.
Finally, rather than the usual empty
“crying room" found in so many
churches, a large separate play area
is equipped with a full box of toys
and a TV.

Nonetheless, I feel as if I have
run away from the more stolidly tra-
ditional Catholic Church. For my
sanity, I couldn't remain part of
such a rigid, patriarchal structure.
I don't agree with all Church posi-
tions, especially on birth control
and divorce. I don't like the way
my Church treats women as second
class citizens. Many women, like
myself, feel alienated from such a
church, and are just now beginning
to make public such feelings.

What else is wrong with the pre-
sent day Catholic Church? For one
thing, the hierarchy is all male.
Only men can become priests, so
only men can move up the ranks to
Bishop, Cardinal and Pope. At the
parish level, women are still ex-
cluded from many of the highly vi-
sible and somewhat prestigious
tasks. Ushers are usually still
men, because money was for so long
a man's domain. Only boys can be
altar servers, although I've heard
that a few American parishes have
attempted to break with this tra-
dition.

However, women are allowed to do
the day-to-day, nuts-and-bolts work
of the Catholic Church. They do
menial labor, much of it volunteer,
at bazaars, baked goods sales, and
bingo games. Also, women have tra-
ditionally acted as servants for
pastors, answering doors, cooking
and cleaning. Also, women, both
nuns and lay women, almost single-
handedly run parochial grammar
schools, even though they are
grossly underpaid. They are paid
just enough that they are ineligible
for food stamps; furthermore, they
are not allowed to receive un-
employment during the summer months.
Yet these women are some of the
most dedicated, hard-working, car-
ing people I've ever met.

Finally, much Catholic belief is
based on male dominance. God, a
non-human, all-powerful being, is
always spoken of as "He." Artists
and writers have reinforced our vi-
sion of God as a male figure, rather
than a perfect being who incorporates
all the best feminine and masculine
qualities. In addition, sermons,
which greatly influence our beliefs,
rarely highlight many of the posi-
tive women from the Bible who could
serve as role models.*

These are just a few of the
problems I have with my church. I'm
angry because I often feel powerless
to change things. Still, I haven't
abandoned my religion completely,
as so many women have. A combina-
tion of guilt, lack of motivation
to learn a new religion, and even
satisfaction with some of my basic
beliefs have prevented me from
leaving. But I still cannot reflect
or pray in a church when I am angry
at what I see or hear.

In the near future, American
Bishops will be composing a Pasto-
ral Letter on “The Role of Women in
the Church and in Society." In pre-
paration, they recently held listen-
ing sessions, where women discussed
their concerns in small groups, while
representatives of the Bishop's Com-
mittee recorded comments. Question-
naires also provided ample space for
comments. Ten of these sessions were
held in our diocese, stretching from
Batavia to Buffalo to Dunkirk to
Olean. This Pastoral Letter will
certainly not alter dogma or proce-
dures. It will, however, be read
in all American parishes at Sunday
Masses. If nothing else, it will
acknowledge that some women are
dissatisfied with their role in the
church. Perhaps it will make Catho-
lics, both lay and religious, more
