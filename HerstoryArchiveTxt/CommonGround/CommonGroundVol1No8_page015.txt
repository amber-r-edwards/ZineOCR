QUESTION:

Sue Brockerhoff, Buffalo:

"Yes, I do think that feminists
have a sense of humor. But I think
people in general tend to stereo-
type feminists by saying that they
don't have one. However, they just
don't laugh at things that others
often laugh at, such as stereo-
types about women, jokes that view
women as inferior, etc.”

Anne Marie Egan, Tonawanda:

"I think they do. The women who
do have a sense of humor are gener-
ally women who have had to develop
it, because they may have had to
make themselves more appealing. For
example, Carol Burnett and Joan
Rivers, who are of an earlier gener-
ation, were not physically "attract-
ive", but they developed their sense
of humor. In general, from what I've
observed, women who have a sense of
humor are not physically attractive.

But, because of the Women's
Movement, women now don't necessarily
have to be attractive or unattractive
to have a sense of humor. It's easier
to be ourselves now."

Sarah Hall, Hamburg:

"In order to be a feeling human
being, you have to have a sense of
humor. So I think it's impossible
not to have one, especially when
you feel as strongly about issues
as the women in the women's move-
ment do. If a person is going to
have such strong motivations, she
is not going to be restricted to
just one area."

Anonymous, Buffalo:

"Not at all. Especially when
they’re on a podium, they are
really serious. Since they want
to be taken seriously, I think
that they are almost afraid to
joke or lighten things."

Lenore Meyers, Buffalo:

“I do see more humor in the
Women's Movement. Feminists usually
seem too angry to be humorous. I
think for that reason, other women
sometimes have difficulty identi-
fying with them; but humor can unite.

I have thought about humor in my
own life recently, and since I've
been under a lot of tension, there
hasn't been any humor; I'm looking
for it. For example, last night
I spent a few hours watching the
movie "9 to 5" on TV instead of
studying for an exam the next day,
because I felt a need for that
humor."

Pamela Hughes, Grand Island:

"I don't think that women display
enough sense of humor. I'm not sure
whether that would be attributed to
the gender or not, though. Perhaps
women aren't as assertive in that
sense. From the little that I've
seen, women in the Women's Movement
haven't displayed that much humor.”

QUESTION FOR JUNE'S COMMUNITY SPEAKOUT:

your behavior or routine, because of

How does this make you feel?"

This month, CG talks to the owner of
the G-Spot Detective Agency. Due to
the specialized and confidential na-
ture of the Agency's work, s/he wishes
to remain completely anonymous. We
thus publish the interview verbatim:
Q: How did you get the idea for the
G-Spot Detective Agency?
A: It came purely by accident one
evening during an encounter with
a close friend. I then did more
research on the area and decided
there was a real need to be
satisfied.

What has been the response to your
service?

A: The response has been absolutely
climactic. It has been truly a
thrilling experience for both me
and my clients.

Speaking of your clientele, how
do people find out about the Agency?
A: In this business, that old adage
"a satisfied customer is the best
advertisement" is absolutely true.
The demand for our services is
beyond our wildest dreams. Of
course, things were a bit tight
at the beginning - a hand-to-mouth
existence, so to speak. But we
are now in a period of expansion.

Q: What criteria do you have for hir-
ing new employees?

A: We are very selective in our hiring
practices. Some of our best em-
ployees are former clients who
have now grasped the fine points
of the technique. Believe it or
not we even have people volunteer-
ing for the job.

Is there much training involved?

A: We use a mix of theory and “hands
on" experience. However, all the
training in the world won't help
if you don't have that innate
talent, that special touch.

What are your plans for the future?
Is there a potential for real
growth in this area?

A: Definitely. You might say we have
just touched the tip of the iceberg.
Some of our plans include Do-It-
Yourself video cassettes and
'Dial-a-G-Spot.'

Q: You obviously enjoy your work.
It's a true labor of love, not
your normal 9 to 5 job. As
friends often remark, I take my
work home with me and I never
tire of it.
