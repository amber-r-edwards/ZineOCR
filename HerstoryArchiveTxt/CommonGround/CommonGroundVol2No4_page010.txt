~~ SOLSTICE GREETINGS ~~

by Silversmith

"Solstice Greetings". "Solstice
Blessings". "In Her Light". These
are the wishes conveyed by Feminist
Witches and other Pagans who cele-
brate the oldest of the late Decem-
ber holidays. From the earliest of
the earth religions the Winter Sol-
stice has been identified as the re-
birth of the sun. Although most
people think of Witches, Pagans and
Goddess worshippers as oriented to
the moon rather than the sun, and
think of the sun as incorporating
male principles and the moon as
female, throughout herstory the sun
has also been identified as female
and her return in December a
holiday to be celebrated.

For centuries, Egyptian fore-
mothers worshipped Hathor who was
both mother and daughter of the sun,
ruler of the sky and the underworld.
She is often depicted as a horned
cow, and as such gave birth to the
universe. Followers of Hathor rec-
ognized the Winter Solstice as the
New Year and carried her images
out of the temples to be blessed by
the first light of the new sun on
the Solstice. Hathor was also a
special protector of women and
female animals.

Later the Romans recognized the
Goddess Lucina, a Goddess of Light,
the sun, childbirth and labor. Her
festival was celebrated with lighted
candles. Just as individuals see
first or new light at birth, the
followers of Lucina see new light
with the return of the sun at
Winter Solstice. The wheel turns,
the world is reborn with the sun.

In Eastern Europe a great pine
log was burned as the light faded
into the longest night of the year.
This log was dedicated to Colleda,
Goddess of the Winter Solstice. At
daybreak, when new light was born,
feasting began. Special treats were
given to children in celebration of
rebirth of the sun and promise of
growth.

For those of us who follow the
Old Ways, who celebrate the festivals
of Mother Earth, the Winter Solstice
retains these age-old meanings. The
promise of light, warmth, growth,
rebirth. It is a time for feasting
and sharing with friends. It is a
time for lighting candles. For joy
in living and being. [In my own
home, the Winter Solstice usually
involves a meal with other women.
It may involve the exchange of gifts,
especially those which are hand
made or grown in our own gardens
and harvested earlier. Our Winter
Solstice ritual will involve light
and fire, reweaving of connections
and bonds, and perhaps predictions
for the coming year. It is inter-
esting that in the south along the
Mississippi River, there is a tra-
dition brought from Britain, of
lighting bonfires on the riverbank
on December 21. No one seems to
know the origin of this, or the
meaning!

On a very personal level I feel
an internal shift with the eight
Earth Holidays: Hallowmas or Samhain
October 31, Solstice or Yule Decem-
ber 20-23, Candlemas February 2,
Spring Equinox March 20-23, Beltane
or May Eve May 1, Summer Solstice
June 20-23, Lughnasadh August 1, and
the Fall Equinox September 20-23.

Perhaps I can best explain this
with the image of the witch's
cauldron. As the wheel of the year
turns, the fire under the cauldron
burns higher and lower. From
Hallowmas to Winter Solstice,
the fire has been low, reaching its
lowest point during the longest
night, and beginning to burn a bit
brighter with the Solstice, reaching
its greatest heat at the Summer
Solstice, then diminishing. Whatever
is in the cauldron -- for me
it's energy, creativity, extro-
vertedness -- is hardly warm in
December. It begins to heat up
following the Solstice and reaches
a rolling boil by the Summer Sol-
stice in late June.

At Winter Solstice I know I am
passing my most introverted time.
My creativity and energy are turned
inward. I am learning, changing,
growth is coming but it won't be
presented until the Equinox in
March when we pass the balance of
light/dark and go into the months
of greater light and the cauldron
begins to bubble a bit.

Although it's a time to share,

a time of joy, Winter Solstice is
also a time of quiet, a personal
time. Just as the roots and seeds
under the earth are quiet in the
winter, I am quiet. With the
Solstice, I know the sprouts will
come.

Enjoy the holidays in Her Light

The Winter Solstice this year is
on December 22 at 5:30 am. It is
the point when the northern hem-
isphere of the earth is at its
greatest tilt away and distance
from the sun, and also signals
the return of longer and longer
hours of daylight. @
