TAMPON ABSORBENCY LABELING:
WHAT CONSUMERS SHOULD KNOW

by Esther R. Rome
for the Boston Women's
Health Book Collective

Women have an opportunity right
now to tell the Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) that they want
clear and simple absorbency
labeling on tampon boxes so they
can reduce their risk of toxic
shock syndrome (TSS).
Unfortunately, even though TSS does
not make the news anymore, women
still die from it.

TSS is a rare, yet serious
disease that affects mainly
menstruating women using tampons.
The use of more absorbent tampons
is associated with a higher risk of
getting TSS. Teenagers, who are
most at risk for TSS and perhaps
the least educated about it, may be
the most vulnerable group.

Immediate symptoms, which can
come on in a matter of hours,
include a fever over 102 degrees,
nausea, diarrhea, dizziness or
fainting. Prompt medical attention
is needed.

The Good Part

The FDA recently proposed a
requirement to test and label
tampon absorbencies. The proposal
includes a letter rating system of
"A" for the least absorbent to "F"
for the most absorbent. There also
is a fine print explanation of how
to compare the absorbencies of
different tampons.

This uniform absorbency rating

is important since the terms
"regular," "super," and "super
plus" are meaningless for

understanding the absorbency of a
tampon. Manufacturers themselves
call these words style terms, not
absorbency terms. For instance,
according to the latest independent
tests completed in February 1987,
one brand "regular" is more
absorbent than Tampax and Kotex
"super" and nearly twice as
absorbent as Playtex and Tampax
"regular."

Some manufacturers already print
a single number, sunscreen-like
rating, on the boxes. The number
is based on the grams of salt water
that the tampon can absorb.

The single number system,

however, is too precise to reflect
what you really find on the store

In the American culture,
self-control is tantamount to a
virtue. Throughout our childhood,
the primary institutions of
influence, family and school,
consistently reinforce the ability
to sit still. According to Eileen
Karter, R.N., B.S.N., "How you move
is how you were brought up." "We
were not meant not to move; keeping
still is contrary to the body's
normal function."

Eileen is one of 700
international practitioners of
Trager Psychophysical Integration,
and the only one practicing the
approach in Buffalo.

The Trager Approach, developed
over 55 years ago by Milton Trager,
M.D., is a learning approach to
movement re-education and gentle
body alignment. Its practitioners,
certified through an intensive
training program at the Trager

Institute in Mill Valley,
California, utilize light, gentle,
non-intrusive movements to
facilitate the release of

currently on the market reveals
sufficient variation from one box
of the same type of tampon to
another that an exact absorbency
number is misleading. Although a
woman should reasonably expect that
a box of "9" tampons would be less
absorbent than a box of "10's",
this is not necessarily so.

In the FDA's proposal each
letter will represent a small range
of absorbencies. A box of "B's"
will nearly always be less than a
box of "C's." The proposed letter
ranges would more accurately
describe what you are buying.

The Bad Part

Unfortunately, another part of
the proposal allows contradictory

labeling, undermining the
regulation's purpose: the terms
"regular," "super," and "super

plus" can be combined with any of
the letter ratings. For instance,
if the proposed labeling were
applied to the products now on the
market there would be a "super B"
and a "regular C." The C category
would have a “regular” and several

Women who understand the
significance of absorbency ratings
will be able to tell which tampons
are more absorbent by ignoring the
style terms, only paying attention
to the letter rating. But many
women will be confused. No one
should have to study the fine print
to find out something this
important.

The only way to avoid confusion
is to standardize or eliminate the
terms "regular," etc. In fact, a
number of years ago the FDA
suggested this. The agency quickly
reversed itself when the tampon
manufacturers objected. It is
extremely important that two
different messages about absorbency
do not appear on the boxes. If the
FDA is serious about reducing the
incidence of TSS then it needs to
revise this part of its absorbency
labeling proposal.

Consumer groups, particularly
the Boston Women's Health Book
Collective (authors of The New Our
Bodies, Ourselves), have
participated in the development of

deep-seated physical and mental
patterns: Holding Patterns. These
holding patterns may inhibit, block
or distort free-flowing motion and
full self-expression. Often they
develop in response to adverse
circumstances such as accidents,
illness, poor posture and emotional
trauma.

Some of Eileen's clients are
referred by other health
professionals for treatment of
physical ailments such as lower
back and neck problems or migraine
headaches. Many, however, come on
their own for the purpose of stress
release. "Our bodies are the
dumping ground for tension which
originates in the mind and is felt
in the body," said Eileen.

A typical session of Trager
Psychophysical Integration takes
about 1½ hours and costs $45.00,
although a sliding scale fee is
available. Eileen, whose
background is Psychiatric Nursing,
takes a medical history and asks
general questions related to
occupation and lifestyle. All the
while she is observing how the
person moves. Therapy begins with
the client lying on a well-padded
table. Eileen moves the client
gently and rhythmically, with no

undue pressure, in such a way that
the recipient actually experiences
the possibility of being able to
move that freely, effortlessly and
gracefully on their own. Eileen
describes it like a dance, which
opens the unconscious to what is
possible. The effects of a Trager
session penetrate below the level
of conscious awareness to produce
results long after the session.
The new sensations of movement
become new habits of movement that
can be recalled and, over time,
automatically take precedence.
Eileen says that recipients have
total recall of the experience

which allows their body to
remember. Every time this new
relaxed state is recalled the
changes deepen and become more
permanent.

A short period of instruction in
Mentastics is usually included in
each session. "Mentastics" is a

word created by Dr. Trager to
describe a system of simple,
effortless, dance-like movement

sequences which he developed to
maintain and even enhance the sense
of lightness, freedom and
flexibility that is basic to the
Trager Approach. These physical
movements, mentally directed, can

ratings. For four years, the
Collective and other consumer
groups worked with the tampon

manufacturers and the FDA at the
agency's request, to develop an
absorbency rating system as part of
a voluntary tampon standard.

Our work has convinced us that
tampon absorbency labeling must be
simple and clear so that women can
choose less absorbent tampons to
lower their risk of toxic shock
syndrome (TSS). We know that the
FDA can be swayed if it receives
enough letters from consumers.

What You Can Do

We urge consumers to write the
FDA both to support the proposed
letter rating system and to push
for the standardization or
elimination of the terms "regular,"
etc. Comments can be sent to the
FDA at Dockets Management Branch
(HFA-84), FDA, 5600 Fishers Lane,
Rockville, MD 20857, until December

22, 1988. Refer to Docket No.

recreate feelings of aliveness and
open the possibility in each
individual for optimal
psychophysical development.

While the Trager Approach is
beneficial both physically and
psychologically, Eileen points out
that people should not expect that
“she can fix them." Rather, they
should come to her prepared to
learn something about themselves,
their lives and their lifestyles.
"Everyone releases holding patterns
in their own way." "The idea is
not to make something happen but to
allow it to happen." Releases can
be dramatic or subtle with people
experiencing everything from nausea
to feeling the need to cry.

Teaching people to "let go"
through the Trager Approach, Eileen
takes a holistic perspective
integrating body, mind and spirit.
Re-education of our psychophysical
system has an impact on the general
well-being of society. A society
whose members function as total
selves is a healthier society.
