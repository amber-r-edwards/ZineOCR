Studio Arena: Women on Stage

by Sharon Beck

The Studio Arena Theater will be
starting a very ambitious 22nd sea-
son October 1st, and it is a season
in which women shine. Not only do
the plays have wonderful storylines
and roles for women, but at least
two of the pieces have been written
by women and several will be direc-
ted by women.

Kathryn Long, the Associate Direc-
tor/Drama Turg at the Theatre is very
enthusiastic about the upcoming sche-
dule. She did not feel that there
had been a conscious attempt to find
plays about women, or specifically
about feminist problems, but rather
that both she and Artistic Director
David Frank were very interested in
what the plays had to say. Accord-

ing, “when you find a play

that speaks eloquently about (a par-
ticular group) it's very exciting”,
although she realized "you never win
in the long run, no matter how glor-
ious the message, if it's not a

good dramatic experience".

Long, whose credits include last
season's Children of a Lesser God,
Greater Tuna, and Terranova; holds
a PhD in directing and is now in
her seventh season at Studio Arena.
She is presently at work on The
Real Thing, the Tony award winning
comedy by Tom Stoppard. The story
involves three women who speak from
very different points of view, but
very well for themselves. Long
mentioned the difficulty in finding
good women's roles and the much
higher number of good male roles
available. "Even the women in the
audience prefer a male protagonist
and I'm sure that somehow comes
out of our culture and the people
we expect to be capable of action".

Long went on to say that she felt
women have always been a guiding
force in regional theatre in this
country, and that there do not
appear to be barriers for women in
theater the way that there may have

been in other professions. If
a position exists in the theatre,
it is as likely to be filled by a
woman as a man, she feels.

In her position as Associate Di-
rector/Drama Turg, Long directs, is
involved with casting, hiring artis-
tic and technical personnel, and
runs the Playworks program which
tests new scripts. She is also very
active with Prologues, a discussion
group which meets with people invol-
ved in a play before the production
is due to open. Its goal is to
give the participants a greater
understanding of the inner workings
of the play.

As director, Long likes to get
involved in a play early and let
it "percolate" for a while, building
its own unique flavor--a luxury which
she admits is uncommon outside of
regional theater. A production at
Studio Arena usually takes about
four weeks from the first read-
through to opening night. Before
that, all designs must be agreed
upon and parts cast. The performances
will generally run for four or five
weeks. In the case of The Real Thing,

which starts rehearsal on the day
after Christmas and will run from
January 22nd to February 15th, Long
has been at work since April.

She prefers working on pieces
that don't depend on large amounts
of detail and finds the opportunity
to create an environment out of very
little one of the most exciting as-
pects of those plays because it
leaves the audience free to imagine.
Long said, "It is always more diffi-
cult to do a few things brilliantly
so they do the job and they do not
intrude than it is to have thousands
of little details". The important
thing for her as a director is to
convey to people that what happens
between individuals doesn't stop
with what happened between the two
of them, but how it reverberates.
