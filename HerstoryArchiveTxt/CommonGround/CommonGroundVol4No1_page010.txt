When the atomic bomb was dropped  
on Hiroshima on August 6, 1945, few  
if any understood the traumatic  
effect this would have on future  
generations. For the past forty  
years the U.S. and the Soviet Union  
have played nuclear one-upmanship  
with each other until today, with  
both sides capable of destroying the  
earth many times over, people of  
many nations, professions and politi-  
cal persuasions are speaking out  
in favor of a nuclear freeze and  
arms reduction.

One of these people is California  
businessman Harold Willens whose  
compelling book THE TRIMTAB FACTOR  
proclaims the nuclear arms race not  
only to have potentially devastating  
results but also to be, quite simply,  
bad business policy. It is Willens'  
belief that the arms race has con-  
tributed significantly to unemploy-  
ment, the massive U.S. budget deficit  
and economic enslavement of the Third  
World.

Contrary to the thinking of many  
people that a war economy is good  
for business--the "World War II got  
us out of the Great Depression" syn-  
drome--Willens contends that guns,  
tanks, planes, etc. are products  
which, in contrast to other consumer  
goods “consume enormous quantities  
of valuable resources but put nothing  
back into the economic system. There-  
fore military spending may in the  
short term stimulate employment and  
purchasing power, but in the long run  
it drains the economy." (p. 56)

Economic dependence on the war  
industry invites inflation, cost

I confess to having read one  
Harlequin romance in my life. Sup-  
posedly, a reader can finish one in  
a single sitting; it took me four  
days. Four days of eyes that snap-  
ped darkly, taunting hard mouths,  
plus much arrogance and scorn.  
Also, sneers, frowns and demands.  
Somehow, the one-dimensional “hero"  
failed to truly fascinate. And  
the less said about the heroine,  
the better. Yet, despite these  
ever-predictable factors, the de-  
mand for similar fantasies has yet  
to abate.

Love's Sweet Return and Reading  
the Romance are two attempts to ex-  
plore the reasons for the enduring

vepartment toilet seats?), and perhaps  
worst of all the deterioration of  

the civilian technological base.

The military sector employs 30 to 50  
percent of all scientists and engin-  
eers in the U.S. This "brain drain"  
of private industry has produced the  
lack of innovation which has led to  
“massive inroads into the automobile,  
steel and commercial electronics  
markets" by foreign industry particu-  
larly Japan and West Germany. (p. 57)

Willens points out further that  
while the U.S. spends on our military  
$46 of every $100 of capital available  
for domestic involvement, West Ger-  
many spends $14 and Japan only $3.70.  
"While Japanese engineers were de-  
veloping solid-state circuitry for  
an array of commercial electronic  
products, Americans were perfecting  
the electronics of sophisticated  
missile systems." (p. 58) Thus, while  
the modern Japanese and West German  
economies flourished, the economies  
of the U.S., the Soviet Union and  
Britain, the three nations with the  
heaviest military expenditures were  
stagnating. Willens believes that  
these facts speak for themselves and  
that American businesspeople must  
for their own professional survival  
speak out against the growing threat  
of national bankruptcy in the guise  
of military readiness.

Cognizant of the reluctance of  
businesspeople to become enmeshed in  
political causes, he carefully avoids  
advocating total de-militarization  
and nowhere in the book does his  
language dip into “preachy” rhetoric.  
He pleads instead for common sense  
as a way out of the economic quagmire  
into which he feels the nation has  
become imprisoned. He quotes one  
New York financier as saying, “I've  
never been vocal about, or in any

popularity of female formula fiction.  
Ms. Jensen's book is the outgrowth  
of a doctoral dissertation completed  
at McMaster University in Hamilton,  
Ontario. Her outlook being Canadian,  
she presents us with a detailed his-  
tory of Harlequin Publishers, the  
grandmother of them all. Janice  
Radway's book, more thorough and  
scholarly, also delves into the  
"sweet savage romance" category;  
however her analysis of their  
publishing history becomes a bit  
tedious.

Interestingly, both authors com-  
ment on the perceived low status of  
romance readers and writers. Scorn-  
ed as no other grouping of popular  
fiction--war, adventure, westerns,  
etc. (despite greater sales) --com-  
parative criticism and analysis of  
typically men's fiction are non-exis-  
tent.

The major goal of both writers  
is to understand the appeal of  
romances from the perspective of  
their readers. The books are char-  
acterized as effortless escape; they  
provide time for oneself--a luxury

way involved in, political and social  
issues. I always thought it best  
for businessmen to leave that to  
others. But now I realize that the  
need to stop and reverse the nuclear  
arms race is no more political than  
the need to find a cure for cancer."

Although THE TRIMTAB FACTOR is a  
short (137 pages) book it is jammed  
with facts and examples all written  
in concise, interesting fashion.  
Willens relates a history of the  
arms race and of our national "Russo-  
phobia" (and conversely of the Soviet  
paranoia about the West), a step-by-  
step guide to extricating ourselves  
from more dangerous and unnecessary  
military spending, and ways members  
of the business community can help  
to alleviate the situation. Herein  
lies the significance of the book’s  
title.

Popular American philosopher R.  
Buckminster Fuller was the first  
to use the "trimtab factor" to ex-  
plain the value of a small amount  
of pressure to produce a powerful  
effect. A trimtab is a tiny rudder  
often attached to the trailing edge  
of the main rudder on large, ocean  
going ships. By exerting slight  
pressure anyone can turn the trimtab  
which turns the main rudder thereby  
changing the direction of the entire  
ship. “Business is the trimtab of  
America, a sector of society that  
possesses inordinate power to influ-  
ence the direction of our national  
enterprise. Our ship of state is  
taking us into very dangerous waters.  
Business leadership can be the trimtab  
that will change our direction be-  
fore it is too late." (p. 27)

Willens' research is admirable and  
his arguments are clear and sensible.  
THE TRIMTAB FACTOR is well worth a  
read.

home or not. They are short, light  
and predictable; they fit around  

the interruptions of a woman's day.  
Also, they wistfully reflect the  
period of most freedom in women's  
lives--young, single adulthood. A  
happy ending is obligatory; indeed,  
any great straying from the accepted  
norm will be rejected.

Jensen and Radway elaborate upon  
expected components. A detailed  
analysis of the typical heroine is  
presented. Preposterously innocent  
by today's standards, she is overly  
dependent on "fate" or luck, and  
this is felt to reflect the lack of  
autonomy in the reader. With some  
exceptions recently, heroines are  
still unconcernedly in the marginal  
workforce, laboring in traditional  
low-pay, low status jobs. In real  
life, most women marry men much like  
themselves in social status; these  
heroines marry "up", often the  
boss. Cinderella appears to be  
alive and well in 1985, at least in  
popular fiction.

The character of the heroes gives  
the authors cause for alarm. Usually,  
we are presented with the evolution  
of an arrogant, domineering rake in-
