COURSE IN SMALL PRESS PUBLISHING

Anyone interested in learning first-
hand about small press publishing is
invited to take a course in the Spring
taught by Stephanie Weisman at both
Black Mountain College and Canisius.
Students choose a group project and
carry it through all the stages of
production from idea through printing
and binding. Guest speakers and
field trips are an important part of
the course. Emphasis is placed on
learning how to publish on a shoestring.
Ms. Weisman is the editor of Black
Mountain II Review.

Black Mountain College II is a

unique college devoted to the

creative arts at SUNYAB.

Its goal is to provide "a place

where the arts, humanities, the
sciences and the practical skills
can be brought together to enrich
the lives of students and faculty
alike." A wide range of multi-
disciplinary courses are offered
and are open to all university
students.

Book Review:

American Women Artists: The First
Complete Story of the Lives and Art
of Hundreds of Women Artists Who Have
Enriched Our Heritage Since the Be-
ginnings of American History, by
Charlotte Streifer Rubinstein. Avon

1982. $12.95 paper.

At our press time, we received a
review copy of this magnificent book.
It contains color and black and white
illustrations of the work of the
women who are biographied in it. The
book is divided into nine chapters:
Native Americans: The First American
Women Artists; Colonial Women Artists
and American Folk Artists; The Golden
Age, 1800-1876; Gilded Age, 1876-1900;
The Ash Can School and Armory Show;
The Thirties, Daughters of the De-
pression; The Forties and Fifties,
Women of the New York School; The
Sixties: Pop Art and Hard Edge; and
The Feminist Art Movement. The his-
torical arrangement of the book allows
the author, Rubinstein, to connect the
position of women, and political
climate of the time, to the lives and
works of the artists.

We will review this book in detail
in an upcoming issue. Look for it!

COMMON GROUND ~ - JANUARY 1983

-enabled us to expand our stock

EMMA IS...

As we begin a New Year, the Emma
collective is reflecting on several
important changes that have taken place.
Most visibly, we moved from the Main and
Greenfield St. location to our present
location in February, almost one year
ago. We feel that this was a good move
for Emma; the store is a bit smaller but
much cleaner (no bugs so far) and
pleasant. We attract a fair number of
browsers from the street traffic along
Elmwood, and so far the neighborhood has
been cordial and friendly - major
improvements over the Main St. location.

Since our move we have experienced
some very positive highlights and
shifts. We welcomed several new women
into the collective who bring energy and
talent that we need very badly. A big
highlight was the "Voices of Women
Writing" event on April 30 to May 1,
which not only inspired us and all who
participated, but also stimulated much
discussion within the collective related
to issues of racism and classism. We
have been working very hard to put our
ideals into action.

Our focus for the fall centered on
how we can better meet the needs of
women in the Western New York Region and
continue to remain viable as a business.
Our business record has been excellent
in our brief 6-year herstory, but we
felt that it was time to take some major
steps to strengthen our service and our
business. We took out a loan that has

several critical areas; health, child-
bearing and child-rearing, fiction,
mysteries, and children's literature.
We hope that these expansions will
provide a resource for groups and
individual women in the Buffalo area who
we may not have served adequately in the
past. We are continuing to try to
identify needs that women in the
community have - if you want to see us
develop resources that you and your
friends might use, please call and let
us know, or come by and let us know what
you want to see at Emma's. We do not
see ourselves as a "money-making"
business. We need to generate an income
that supports the cost of running a
small business (minus staffing costs
which we presently volunteer as
collective members), but any money that
we do make from the sale of books and
other merchandise above our operating
costs goes back into services for women
in the Buffalo area.

We made the decision during the fall
to discontinue the regular Emma
Newsletter, and to lend our support to
Common Ground by publishing this column
in each issue. We are excited about
this news journal and the many ways in
which it will provide a resource for
women in the area, and hope that this
joining of efforts will improve our
communications within the community.

Remember our Saturday story hour!
Some of our fans asked for an extra hour
of sleep-in time, so we now start at
11:00 a.m. for kids of all ages! Also,
we want to provide our space at the
store for various discussion groups of
important and interesting books that are
being published in women's literature.
If you would be interested in taking
part in a discussion group, let us know
of your interest and we will try to
facilitate a group.
