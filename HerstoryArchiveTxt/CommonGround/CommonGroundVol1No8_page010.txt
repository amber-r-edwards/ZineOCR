{In this space usually appears our  
column "Daphne's Tree", on the sub-  
ject of herbs and their uses.  
However, one of the more literate  
members of the garden seems to have  
undertaken a hijack attempt this  
month...  

It is I--Daffy Tree. Daphne's out  
to lunch. We'll just have to make do  
without her. My friend Rowan Tree  
says no sweat. Daphne would say "the  
bark of Rowan is thought to be an  
effective treatment for malaria." In  
fact, Daph' carries around a piece  
of Rowan bark in the pocket of her  
chrome oxide green chenille bathrobe.  
That bathrobe has got to go. Rowan  
and I think if Daphne would only quit  
taking hot bubble baths, she'd sweat  
less and Rowan could keep her bark  
intact. Rowan's paid her dues as  
the magical tree of life, not to  
mention as the food of the gods.  

But, let's do a little tree-o-logy.  
I'll tell you when good old Daphne  
moved into the tree community. That  
weirdo Apollo, who used to chase her  
all the time, came up with a truly  
bizarre idea. As Dryden put it for  
Apollo, who wasn't much with words:  
"Because thou canst not be/ My mis-  
tress, I espouse thee for my tree...  
(For more of this particular tree-o-  
logy, see Daphne's oral herstory,  
Common Ground, September, 1982),  
Apollo could just as well have settled  
down with Heliotrope, who loved him,  
if he hadn't let his ego get in the  
way over The Great Daphne Chase. Of  
course, he didn't know at the time  
that Daph' had taken up Self-Defense.  
But, why should he have known? If  
he'd left Daphne alone in the first  
place, she would never have needed a  
self-defense course.  

What's that you say, Willow Tree?  
"In love, the sad forsaken wight/  
The willow garland weareth." Wight?  
You say it means living creature and  
you're quoting Thomas Drayton? Who  
ever heard of Thomas Drayton? Willow,  
I know you're vastly misunderstood,  
but one of these days you just have  
to get your osiers (tough, pliant  
branches) together. No use romanticiz-  
ing Apollo. He's the one who harassed  
Daphne. It's called a double  
standard.  

Willow, you're getting to be a  
regular crybaby. Water's one thing.  
Water's sacred. But, look at that  
miserable puddle. Raise your Con-  
sciousness, Willow. What about Great  
Mother Isis? "Leave off thy weeping  
and lamentation, put away all thy  
sorrow, for behold the healthful day  
which is ordained by my providence."  
More tears? Willow this just isn't  
your Day.  

Hawthorne Tree over there has the  
correct idea. Dancing and feasting  
all the time, and in full, snow-white  
flower at that. Hawthorne can afford  
to celebrate, because she's convinced  
the local inhabitants that if they  
sit beneath her in May, the Faeries  
will take them away...or strike them  
blind. Ever since, the locals have  
been trying to wash olive oil with  
rose spring water to protect their  
eyes.  

Elder Mother Tree has driven off  
a few establishment types in her time,  
too. Look, Willow, she's a waterside  
tree like you are. But she stands by  
the water, not in a puddle of tears.  
Taking that Assertiveness Workshop at  
the Tree Center did her wonders.  
Elder Mother told me that she finally  
got fed up to her white blossoms with  
being a symbol of sorrow and death.  
You have to be properly respectful of  
Lady Ellhorn, as Elder Mother's  
known in her social circle.  

Hard to believe, isn't it Willow,  
that Hawthorne and Elder Mother are  
considered the unluckiest of trees?  
The locals know that they destroy  
either Hawthorne or Elder Mother at  
their peril. And, just look at  
"fatal" Yew, the ‘coffin of the vine’.  
Tasteless symbolism. Yew Tree is  
far better intentioned. It may be  
that Hamlet's Uncle Claudius poi-  
soned Hamlet's father with the juice  
of the fruit of Yew. The Dryads have  
better sense. A Dryad knows her life  
is linked with Yew's. And, no self-  
respecting Good Witch would ever  
plant a garden without Yew, anymore  
than without Rowan, Hawthorne, Elder  
Mother or you, sister Willow. That's  
the Tree Outreach Program for you.  

Willow--gather your tears. Here  
comes Daphne, lunch in hand. She's  
been to the take-out herbateria again.  
Whatcha got, Daph'? A flower salad?  
Alfalfa sprouts with mandarin orange  
sections and Nasturtiums, on a bed of  
Comfrey, garnished with blue Borage  
blooms, sweet Honeysuckle, Radish  
flowers, Violets and Rose petals?  

By Isis, Daphne and I need to have a  
little talk.

NEW USES  
FOR B.P.C.  
TOWERS  

As many people in Buffalo are  
aware, the main building at Buffalo  
Psychiatric Center is considered a  
historic landmark. "The Towers"  
however, are not in use, and B.P.C.  
has engaged in a study to see how  
best to put this facility to use--  
both to serve the community and to  
bolster its cutback budget. CG was  
able to obtain an exclusive interview  
with a prominent member of the Board  
of Community Regression (who did not  
wish to be named, for obvious rea-  
sons), and he was able to list for us  
some of the ideas being brainstormed  
for this complex.  

"Complex," he said, "was a word we  
keyed on here. Perhaps you've heard  
of our idea to turn this into an  
apartment building? What people don't  
realize is that this could be the  
first theme apartments in the nation!  
Think of it--on one side, a men's  
building, the Oedipal Complex. On  
the women's wing, the Electra Complex.  

The middle section is mixed, and we'd  
call that the Inferiority Complex."  
If that idea doesn't grab you,  
try another unique concept—the  
theme shopping mall. "We could con-  
tact that lingerie dealer in Holly-  
wood," said our source, "and call  
the new outlet 'The Freudian Slip'.  
Or how about a sandwich shop called  
'Sub-limation'? Ideas are endless:"  
Enough said on that. Any other  
ideas? CG asked. “If all else fails,  
we could make it a women's center,"  
he said. "After all they've been the  
main occupants to date."
