SUMMARY AND COMMENTARY  

One suggested that pre-training and  
training courses be in the same area,  
so that one flows into the other  
without disrupting the trainee.  
Program designers should make sure  
that there are jobs available to  
trainees when they complete the pro-  
gram. They can make sure that coun-  
selors, trainees and prospective  
employers are sensitive to the needs  
of women and no longer use outdated  
stereotypes.  

The conference organizers hoped  
that their presentation would ex-  
plain how JTPA works, how women can  
best take advantage of it and avoid  
pitfalls; explain where the system  
puts women at a disadvantage, and  
they hoped that information about JTPA  
would be made available to women.  
They realized that there isn't much  
anyone can do to change it or make  
it better for women.  

To ensure that trainees complete  
programs, Dr. Charlop suggests that  
women be encouraged to start support  
groups for problem/solution sharing.  
Another way to eliminate potential  
problems is to outreach to male  
trainees to minimize sexual harass-  
ment. Included should also be  
training on job-networking, resume  
preparation and interview skills.  

After a woman is placed in a job,  
they need continued follow-up sup-  
port, said Dr. Charlop. There should  
be continued support group activity  
and shared child care referrals.  

To analyze the effectiveness of  
the program, Dr. Charlop said the  
training programs should be evalu-  
ated by placements and the number of  
women who finish programs. Changes,  
additions and effective programs  
would be suggested for inclusion in  
future contracts in the JTPA.  

There will be another JTPA confer-  
ence in March or April for JTPA eli-  
gible women to teach them how to ob-  
tain services.  

In getting information about JTPA  
publicized, they also hoped that the  
facts about women workers in W.N.Y.  
would be publicized, and explode some  
of the myths about women in the work-  
force that make it so hard for women  
to gain employment. The conference  
gave a wealth of information about  
the poor economic situation women  
face, the barriers to employment both  
psychological, social, racial and  
sexual that are a reality for women.  

Unfortunately, the Buffalo News  
put the following headline on their  
brief report of this conference:  
“Recession Tougher On Male Workers."  
This conference was about how tough  
it is on all workers, and about the  
extra burdens women face.
