POETRY

Black on White

Dark-fringed branches,  
Tempest-tossed and storm-tormented,  

Hang like witches' wash-day in the sky;  

While beyond them  

White-fringed ragged clouds  

Race like a moving photo-image.  
And a sound tremendous  

From these towering tree-pagodas  

Haiku  

Candle flickering  

Winds sweep around the corner  
Flame - a weathervane.  

Wails above the organ-point of roaring wind.  

Barbara Howard  

Icicles forming  
Crystal daggers glistening  
Piercing to the quick (my heart).  

Black cat on doorstep  
Comes back after many years  
Several lives ago.  

Sunday Night  

I will throw away the lists I've written  
but years from now we'll still need  

the same things.  

We'll break plates  

Maybe we'll have a child  

to care for.  

What will ever change for us?  
Loneliness - the phone  
rings - a warm kiss,  

no kiss at all.  

Luggage, airplanes,  

coming home,  
new carpeting,  

new baby, older parents -  
a fire in the kitchen,  
snow on the lawn.

Kindling  
by Ruth M. Stahl  

There's something comforting about  
a pile of kindling, especially on a  
sunny, windless, fall day, when I'm  
all alone. My neighbors are busy  
inside, and the children are at  
school. There's a cat or two keeping  
me company, and the old dog  
stretched out in the sun.  

The pile of branches awaits my  
now-dulled pruning saw. It's probably  
not the proper tool, but it's  
light, and it fits my hand. It's  
probably not even necessary that I  
saw this kindling, but it's part of  
my ritual. To examine each branch  
and decide where to best cut, to  
remember how it came to be on my  
pile of discards. There's one from  
the maple that was too close to the  
house, more from the poplar that died  
and had to be felled, the willows that  

just snapped off as willows are apt  
to do. Pieces from the tough old  
hedge and the remains of the pines  
we had to remove, making space for  
the new barn.  

This is a leisurely task, and a  
pleasurable one. Even as I cut, a  
whiff of woodsmoke drifts by - someone  
has a warming fire to ward off  
the morning chill. I pause as I  
work to admire the purples and  
yellows of the autumn field flowers,  
to speculate on the placement of  
yet another bird feeder, to wonder  
how much longer our old dog will  

be with us, to watch the cats sunning  

on the woodpile, secretly alert to  
the mouse that may be hiding within.  

Retrospect and renewal, what was  
and what is to come. A renewal of  
my spirits and my woodpile. We really  
don't need any more kindling; the  
fireplace is in the parlor, and we  
seldom sit there anymore.
