Grafenberg Spot

THE GRAFENBERG SPOT AND FEMALE
EJACULATION; Preliminary Surveys,
Buffalo/Philadelphia ~ 1981

By Madeline Davis, Beverly Whipple, R.N.
and Dr. Bonnie Bullough.

(Editor's note- We are pleased to be
able to publish this preliminary report
on original research conducted partly
in Buffalo, in which Buffalo-area
women participated. While a bit tech-
nical in nature, it contains new and
provocative information which we can
add to our understanding of the female
body and may help to de-mystify some

of its workings for us. We hope to be
able to publish more findings as they
are compiled, and that this prelim-
inary report will open up new questions
and encourage further dialogue.)

In the Summer of 1981, two groups of
women, one in Buffalo, N.Y. and one in
Philadelphia, Pa. attended presentations

on current research on the "Grafenberg
Spot and Female Ejaculation". For those
of you who will read these results but
were not in attendance at the talks, the
Grafenberg Spot is an area located on
the anterior wall of the vagina under
the urethra but in front of the cervix,
which, when stimulated, may cause orgasm
and/or ejaculation in some women. Those
women in attendance at these lectures
filled out questionnaires relating to
their knowledge of and familiarity with
this and other forms of sexual activity.
These are partial results of those
questionnaires. It should also be
noted that more data has been collected
since that time which will be run
through computers and tabulated. The
results of the larger samples, includ-
ing the Buffalo and Philadelphia groups,
will be published at a later date.

From the questionnaires, 58 from Buffalo, 20
from Philadelphia. Of the total sample

(78), 15 women always experienced orgasm
when having sex with a partner, 50
usually did and 9 indicated sometimes.
The method of bringing this about was
not part of the question.

Of those who were orgasmic, 29 women
or 37.7% experienced orgasm through in-
ternal stimulation only. 48 or 62.3%
did not. Of those orgasmic, 50 or 64.1%

experienced orgasm through external

stimulation only. 28 or 35.7% did not.
66 or 85.7% experienced orgasm through
combined external and internal stimula-
tion. 11 or 14.3% did not. It is of
interest to note that 7 women, or 9%,
experienced orgasm with no physical
stimulation at all, and that 16 or 20.5%
experienced orgasm by physical stimula-
tion other than vaginal or clitoral
(e.g. breasts, anus, etc.).

Of those women who noted a distinct
difference in stimulation of the an-
terior wall of the vagina from other
vaginal stimulation (40 or 54%), 36, or
95% noted definite swelling after sti-
mulation. 33 women, or 45.8%, noted a
correlation between anterior wall sti-
mulation and orgasm. Of those noting
an actual orgasm caused by anterior
wall stimulation, 23 or 63.9% noted
that their orgasms were more intense,
fuller, wider, or greater in terms of
tension release following the orgasm.

Of those women noting that they had
orgasms (by whatever type or stimula-
tion would produce them), 45 or 60.8%
noted release of fluid occurring at the
time of climax. Of those experiencing
orgasm by internal stimulation, 14 or
32.6% released fluid (ejaculation). Of
those experiencing orgasm from clitoral
stimulation, 6 or 14% ejaculated. Of
those experiencing orgasm from a com-
bination of external and internal stimu-
lation, 33 or 75% ejaculated.

Of the 78 women tested, 66 or 88%
masturbate and 65 of these at least
sometimes masturbate to orgasm: 33 or

48.5% always. Ejaculation occurs
during masturbation with much less fre-
quency than does ejaculation with a
partner, according to our respondents.

Of the 78 questioned, 60 or 80% had
had sex with a male, and of those, 31
or 51.7% experienced orgasm with a
male. We asked what kind of stimula-
tion caused orgasm during contact
with a male and the results were: male-
internal, 26 or 47.3%, male-external
(manual, oral, etc.) 33 or 60%, male-
combination, 39 or 70%.

Of the 78 respondents, 39 or 53.4%
had had sex with a woman. Of those,
39 or 69.6% caused orgasm in another
woman. Of those having caused orgasm,
17 or 37% were aware of her partner
ejaculating during orgasm. Of those
causing ejaculation during orgasm, 10
or 31.3% caused orgasm to occur using
internal stimulation, 17 or 53.1% used
external stimulation and 21 or 65.6%
caused orgasm and ejaculation through a
combination of internal and external.

We can extract from this data the
following: In a predominantly white,
college educated, combined working and
middle class group of women, many of
whom hold professional jobs, almost
half of these women have experienced
orgasm by stimulation of the anterior
vaginal wall, the area of the Grafen-
berg Spot. Almost 61% of these women
noted ejaculation through a variety of
types of stimulation and 32.6% noted it
as the result of internal stimulation.
51.7% of those women having had sex
with a man noted orgasms as the result
of this sexual experience. 69.6%
of the women having had sex with a
woman noted orgasm as a result of this
sexual experience.

It should be noted that many respon-
dents failed to answer one or more ques-
tions, which is why numbers or percent-
ages will not always total 73 or 100%.

At present, this sample is too small
to draw conclusions for a larger popu-
lation. A sample of 200 was recently
received and is being processed. What
is noteworthy is the information that a
kind of orgasm, other than that which
is solely clitorally stimulated, ap-
pears to exist. The questions are:
What are the implications for women
learning about their sexuality, and,
what does this mean to the potential
for both the expansion of information
and pleasure?
Questions relevant to the social implica-
tions of future findings. It is hoped
that these questions will be addressed
as more data is collected.

There are many more ques-

Increasing Physical Ability;

The New
Wave of —

by Lisa Cappellano
Women have always paid attention

to their looks, but now more and more
women are also joining the forces of
increasing their physical ability also.
Frankly, with all the fad diets and
exercises, a person would need a
private secretary to keep track of
them all, when all you need is a sim-
ple calisthenics program and a nutri-
tional diet.

Have a written program, so that
when you are ready to start the calis-
thenics you can keep track of the exer-
cises, sets and repetitions. When you
find that you can easily finish your
exercises, increase the repetitions.
That's the whole reason you are start-
ing this program: to increase your
physical ability. Along with a writ-
ten program, keep a progress sheet.
Then you can see on paper just how
much you have improved.

When I mention you should be on a
nutritional diet, this does not in-
clude fasting three days out of the
week. You should have three meals
daily. Try to cut sugar out of your
diet completely. You can substitute
the store-bought sugar with natural
sugar in fruit. Have two or three
pieces of fruit a day and you will
give your body the sugar it needs. Be-
come aware of the nutritional value of
your food. You need the right amount
of minerals and vitamins to allow your
body to function normally. If you
find that you get hungry at night,
don't give up; stick to your diet.
Grab some celery, carrots or a reason-
able amount of unsalted popcorn. With
a controlled diet along with the exer-
cises, you'll feel and look much
better.

Remember proper clothing is as im-
portant as proper exercises. Wear
shorts or sweatpants, properly fitted
sneakers, sweat socks and a comfort-
able shirt. You may wear a support or
jogging bra for comfort, but it is not
necessary. Most department stores
carry these bras at a reasonable rate.

With all this in mind, you should
be able to start your program. Now
you won't get good results if you just
exercise or diet. You must have both.
If you've tried exercising in the past
and wondered why you didn't lose
weight or look thinner, it may be be-
cause you did not watch the foods you
ate. Diet and exercise programs must
go hand in hand to be effective.

Before starting your program (exer-
cises), it would be advisable to see a
doctor for a check-up. Make sure you
tell the doctor your intentions of
starting a fitness program. She/he
may be able to assist you in choosing
the right program for you. Ask your
doctor if your blood pressure is o.k.,
and ask what would be the safest
amount of weight you should lose or
even if you should lose at all. You
may be at the proper weight for your
body structure/height and won't have
to curtail your daily consumption. So
many times a woman will look flabby
and decide to go on a drastic diet
when actually she is eating right but
needs to start an exercise program to
tone her muscles. The results will
look like she lost weight. If you can-
not afford the full cost of a check-up,
there are some low-cost clinics listed
on the resource page of this paper.
