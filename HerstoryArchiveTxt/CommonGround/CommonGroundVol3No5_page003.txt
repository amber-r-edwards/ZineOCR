volunteer center, but the response  
and the need was so great that  
they hired a paid staff member.  
Now they may have to close, unless  
money is immediately forthcoming.  
(For more information, see the  
"Letters" page in this issue.)

One CG collective member has  
a theory about money in the women's  
community. "There is only $25,  
and one group passes it on to  
the next, and it goes ‘round and  
'round, never getting any bigger,"  
she said.

The constant hassle about  
money, time and energy has taken  
its toll on the CG collective.  
Thirty busy women, all of whom  
have other responsibilities,  
have been putting this paper to-  
gether for over two years and  
we are understandably somewhat  
burned out. Fried might be a  
better term.

CG was saved from an untimely  
death only last month when a  
collective member reached deeply  
into her new homeowner's pocket  
and came out with $200 to help  
pay the printing bill. Our sub-  
scription rate is down, too. If  
we don't have subscribers, we  
can't, in all honesty, ask adver-  
tisers to buy space in the paper.

If you are not going to renew  
your subscription, please let  

us know why. If you have com-  

viewpoints of the women's commun-  
ity.

Thirty subscriptions will pay  
the printing bill for this month.  
One full page ad or two half page  
ads will pay for February. March  
is covered by an ADS grant for  
a special arts issue, but we  
need to be able to publish until  
then.

So--I bet you are wondering  
what you can do, so soon after  
the holiday season. First, send  
money--gifts, subscriptions, any-  
thing at all. Second, send other  
pieces of paper--stories, com-  
mentaries, poems, photos, all  
submissions are greatly appre-  
ciated. Third, give your time  
--sell advertising, distribute  
the paper, do layout, proofread,  
help at selections, take the  
paper to the printer or the post  
office, do bookkeeping.

There, we've provided you with  
a list. Do any or all of these  
things and you'll be appreciated  
so much that it won't even feel  
like work.

Seriously folks, we do need  
help and we do need money and we  
know we've asked before. But  
we are not crying wolf. CG  
needs your help to survive.

POLICY

PHILOSOPHY — Common Ground is potentially, with  
help from Western New York women, a forum to  
celebrate the rich diversity of our community. We view  
the paper as a ribbon that may connect our  
commonalities, our intersection points. We are inviting  
you to participate actively in the building of a support  
system for WNY women. We affirm our commitment to  
enhance the lives of women on physical, educational,  
spiritual, psychological, social and economic levels. We  
want to present, fair-mindedly, the issues that concern  
women, and information of value to women. We offer  
Common Ground as a place where women can display  
their art and personal literature, and re-view the  
tapestries of their experiences.

EDITORIAL POLICY — Common Ground is especially  
looking for articles which address the needs and  
interests of local women.

1. Common Ground is a publication of news, culture  
and dialogue from women’s perspectives.

2. News, Opinion, Analysis and Commentary will each  
be clearly labeled as such.

3. We are seeking to provide accurate, straightforward  
information of value to women.

4. The collective will not intentionally print or support  
materials or viewpoints which will harm women  
because of color, sexuality, religious or ethnic  
background, physical disability or economic situation.

5. While opinions expressed in Common Ground are  
those of the authors and not necessarily those of the  
collective as a whole, we do accept responsibility for  
choosing what we print.

SUBMISSIONS — We welcome articles, letters,  
information and announcements of interest to women.  
Graphics, cartoons, art and photography will be  
gratefully received. We especially invite women who  
do not usually have access to traditional media —  
women of color, differently abled, economically or  
educationally disadvantaged, and those for whom  
English is a second language — to write. Suggested  
length of letters: 250 words. Letters must be signed to  
be printed. We will, however, respect your privacy and  
withhold your name if you request. Suggested length of  
articles, commentary, analysis: 500-750 words. Please  
type and double space your work, 40 characters across.  
If you do not have access to a typewriter, please print  
clearly. In time we hope to have a typewriter, paper,  
etc., available for those who request it. Include a  
stamped, self-addressed envelope and work and home  
phone numbers. Because we want to hear your voices,  
if your piece needs to be edited for length or clarity, we  
will call you/ask you to do it. Keep copies of your work.  
We will try to notify you within three (3) weeks if we  
intend to use your work. If we print it, we will give you  
five (5) copies of the issue in which it appears. Artwork  
should be black and white copies only, and  
title/describe your work. We will copyright the entire  
issue, but the copyright on each piece reverts to the  
author/artist, that she may decide where her work is  
printed. Please request a style sheet for further  
information and guidelines if you want to write.
