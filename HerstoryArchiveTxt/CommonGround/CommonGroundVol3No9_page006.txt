In this non-fiction collection,  
Alice Walker delves into a variety  
of subjects, most of them from her  
perspective as a Black woman writer,  
a feminist and a mother. Included  
is her first published essay, from  
1967, a cogent and thoughtful piece  
on the Civil Rights movement, yet  
one which lacks the strong feminism  
of her later work. Indeed, if one  
notes the dates of the essays, one  
can follow the crystallization of  
her feminism.  

Many of the pieces deal with  
writers who influenced her, as well  
as issues of concern to Blacks. For  
Walker, these two topics often mesh.  
For instance, in the title piece,  
she takes Virginia Woolf one step  
further: “In A Room of One's Own,  
Woolf wrote, probably with white  
women in mind, of the lost and unre-  
cognized talent and even genius of  
so many women. Walker reminds us  
that Black women must recognize  
the art of their mothers and grand-  
mothers, whether their skills blos-  
somed through their quilts or their  
gardens.  

She also pleads the case of Black  
writers, especially women, who either,  
at worst are virtual unknowns, or at  
best receive only patronizing lip  
service from critics (largely white  
and male). As proof, she notes how  
many college students are familiar  
with Kate Chopin's The Awakening,  
yet few have ever heard of an equally  
compelling work by Zora Neale Hurston,  
God, which was out of print until  
1979.

could mean to the consciousness of  
the emerging writer," admires the  
craft and characters of southern  
writer Flannery O'Connor. At the  
same time, she disdains the fact  
that after their deaths, O'Connor's  
house, as well as that of William  
Faulkner, are still being maintained  
by caretakers (Black, of course),  
while the very locations of houses  
(or even graves, as in the case of  
Zora Neale Hurston) of Black writers  
are unknown.  

She also respects the work of Jean  
Toomer, especially his celebrated  
Cane, even though he denied his own  
Blackness at the same time as he  
wrote poignantly of Black Southern  
existence.  

As a mother, I was heartened by  
Walker's honesty about how near-im-  
possible it was to write while caring  
for a small child. Yet I was touched  
by her repeated mention of how the  
presence of her daughter proved to  
be an inspiration, especially for  
her renowned novel The Color Purple.*  

Reminiscences of the inspiring  
Martin Luther King, an interview  
with Coretta Scott King, a discussion  
of the absence of Black lesbians in  
American literature, her horror over  
nuclear proliferation, and an account  
of her own childhood accident are  
just some of the other diverse, yet  
connected topics in this collection  
of "womanist" prose, as the author  
calls it. In fact, the very arrange-  
ment of the essays permits them to  
flow together and the book can be read  
almost as a whole, rather than one  
essay at a time. Whether or not you  
are familiar with Alice Walker's  
poetry and fiction, you are bound to  
find both her anger and her insight  
compelling.

that a movie is currently being made  
of The Color Purple, starring Whoopi  
Goldberg of Broadway fame.

is relieved of her white liberal  
guilt. For the "normal" white woman  
(read the Organization member or  
sympathizer) life, with fear of  
rape by Blacks, is a “nightmare."  
The Organization would summarily  
shoot the rapist.  

Turner begins with some tradi-  
tional ideas about the inappropriate-  
ness of directing violence against  
women unless they are Jewish or non-  
White. His attitudes have shifted  
by the middle of the book to self-  
righteous killing of white women if  
they "have no racial pride.”  

The radical right paradise is a  
man's world. She can survive the  
coming violence if she is white and  
properly proud of it--maybe. She  
can be part of the revolution if  
her husband lets her, or to the ex-  
tent he allows. The White knights  
will cherish and protect her if she  
behaves. And by all means, the re-  
volutionary woman must maintain her  
femininity. How she is to partici-  
pate in the revolution and be tem-  
inine when femininity is also equated  
with the enemy is hard to determine.  
Macdonald/Pierce has Turner noting  
that "Liberalism is an essentially  
feminine, submissive world view.  
Perhaps a better adjective than fem-  
inine is infantile."  

Books Like the Turner Diaries  
present a dilemma. In part I would  
urge those who don’t like the ideas  
expressed to read this book, to know  
what the model is, to take more  
seriously than we usually do the  
beliefs of the Earl Turners of the  
world. On the other hand, if you  
react as I did, this book will make  
you feel sick, dirty, and extremely  
resentful that you have spent any  
money for it which will only go to  
support the people who write and  
believe this kind of material.  
Turner Diaries is obscene in the  
truest sense of the word. It is  
also well constructed and well  
written enough to attract the reader  
who believes, in part, with the  
author. It could catch the unsus-  
pecting reader up in the progression  
from fairly moderate racist fantasy  
to ultimate horror.  

Given some of the items which have  
hit the news media since the author  
decided to write this review--arrests  
of men who claim membership in the  
Order for murder and other violence,  
and indications that in their homes  
are kept weapons, right-wing materials  
and perhaps the dossiers mentioned  

in The Turner Diaries which keep  

track of the opposition--she has  
chosen to write this review under a  
pseudonym.
