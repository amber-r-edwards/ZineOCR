Chisholm on Reaganomics

By Maria Ceraulo

"Some congressmen are re-elected
every two years which is hard to be-
lieve when I look at their voting rec-
ord," scorned Congresswoman Shirley
Chisholm. Chisholm was in Buffalo
this summer at a presentation spon-
sored by Women in Government at Erie
Community College.

"It is obvious they are not re-
lating to the people,” she added.
“People don't always demand accounta-
bility of their officials and I don't
understand why."

She promised that Reaganomics has
not gone unnoticed by American women
by reporting the results of a recent
Lou Harris poll which shows women will
cast a 12 percent leading vote for
Democrats this November. She warned
that Lou Harris has said the single
most important obstacle to those
seeking election will be the vote of
American women.

The congresswoman called Presi-
dent Reagan's budget cuts and civil
rights actions "made in the past 15 years."

Later, she accused Reagan of hav-
ing a Cabinet "with few members who
empathize let alone sympathize with
the concerns of women at this time."

She said the President wants to
eliminate regulations to businesses
that deal with the government "be-
cause he feels it hinders businesses
and the free enterprise system."

This, she explained, would mean that
such businesses would no longer be re-
quired to file periodic compliance
reviews, reducing their accountabili-
ty to the federal government. "Do

we expect that AT&T, who has recently
paid $13 million in sex discrimina-
tion law suits, will suddenly police
themselves into hiring and promoting
women?" she asked rhetorically.

In promoting a spirit of New Feder-
alism and shifting power to the state
level, she called it erroneous for
the Administration to assume the states
will know what is best for the people.
"Historically," said Chisholm, "the
states have proven indifferent to the
needs of certain (minority) citizens,
but suddenly the Administration ex-
pects them to be icebergs of passion."

Chisholm predicted the 12 percent
expected budget cut for the Equal
Employment Opportunity Commission
(EEOC) will "rather silently" force
the closings of many EEOC city branch-
es. This, she noted, comes at a time
when the commission has a back-
log of (sex discrimination) complaints
and is forced to process a smaller
percentage of them through the courts.

In 1969 Congress passed Title IX,
which prohibits sex discrimination in
any organization receiving federal
financial assistance. Chisholm
warned that "a Presidential Task
Force has slated Title IX for review
and reinterpretation."

She said conservative leaders,
including Senator Orrin Hatch, have
favored a bill introduced to Congress
to ease Title IX requirements to
only programs directly and primarily
funded by the government, rather than
to all organizations receiving any
federal funds. According to her,
the latter is more often the case,

it “gave women the opportunity to pur-
sue careers that were formerly male-
dominated." Engineering, she recalled,
was one field ‘for men only' until
Title IX, but in 1980 over 6,000 col-
lege women graduated in the field.

Additionally, she praised Title
IX for helping men break into tra-
ditionally female fields by citing
an increase from four percent to 21
percent in men entering homemaking
during 1969-1979.

Title IX is most widely known for
its impact on increased athletic op-
portunities for girls. Chisholm's
statistics for the same 10-year period
show 527 percent more girls were com-
peting in interscholastic sports,
where formerly all sports funding,
including scholarships, automatically
went to boys.

Another program slated for cuts
is WIC, a supplementary food pro-
gram that the Congresswoman char-
acterized as "unblemished by fraud or
abuse and proven cost effective."

Eligible parents receive a govern-
ment letter redeemable at local super-
markets for listed foodstuffs only,
i.e. a quart of milk or orange juice.
She said research by medical pro-
fessionals consistently proves that
every dollar spent in WIC saves three
dollars in medical expenses later.

Chisholm reported eight million
people are eligible, but only two
million are being served.

The Congresswoman, who will re-
tire from Congress after this year,
has accepted a teaching position
at Mount Holyoke College in South
Hadley, Mass. She vowed to remain
active in the political arena, but re-
fused to give further details.

Maria Ceraulo is a junior media
communications major at Medaille
College and a Common Ground collect-
ive member.
