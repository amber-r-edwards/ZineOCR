This workshop was presented  
by Marlene Provizer, Assistant  
Director of the National Jewish  
Community Relations Advisory  
Council, and Lana Benatovich,  
Community Relations Committee  
of the Jewish Federation.

Marlene Provizer began  
the workshop by talking  
about Black/Jewish Relations  
often referring to a Black/  
Jewish Women's Dialogue  
Group of which she is a  
member. When her group began  
meeting, they spent a lot of  
time getting to know each  
other and building trust  
before broaching emotionally-  
charged issues. She recom-  
mended this strategy for  
other groups.

Although this workshop  
was very much from a Jewish  
perspective, Marlene pre-  
sented some of the obstacles  
between Blacks and Jews.  
First, Blacks see Jews as  
"just like other white  
people" with educational  
and economic advantages.

Other areas of conflict have  
included affirmative action,  
Israel and South Africa.

These differences, how-  
ever, have been magnified by  
the media. For example, when  
Louis Farrakhan called Judaism  
“an outlaw religion” it was  
big news, but we did not hear  
of his criticism of Christians,  
calling them "liars, thieves  
and murderers.” (Pioneer  
Women, Nov/Dec 85)

On affirmative action, the  
Anti-Defamation League of  
the B'nai B'rith sided with  
Marco DePunis, a Sephardic  
Jew, who filed suit against  
the University of Washington  
for “reverse discrimination.”  
However, the National Council  
of Jewish Women and the Union  
of American Hebrew Congre-  
gations both entered the case  
in support of affirmative  
action.

Many would be surprised to  
learn that Black politicians  
have as good a record in  
support of Israel as the  
Jewish Caucus in Congress.

Jews and Blacks do, in  
fact, have a lot in common --  
a history of oppression for  
one. They are also the only  
two groups whose voting re-  
mains liberal regardless of  
higher incomes. As the old  
saying goes, "Jews have  
incomes like Episcopalians,  
but vote like Puerto Ricans."  
Both Jews and Blacks voted  
against Reagan.

Lana Benatovich talked  
about what has been done  
in Buffalo to bring the two  
communities together including:

1. Representatives of the  
Jewish Federation attended  
Black Leadership Conference.

2. 25 Jewish groups were  
represented at the Martin Luther  
King Jr. celebration.

3. The Jewish Federation  
presented an Anti-Apartheid  
statement.

To understand child-rearing  
in Israel one needs to understand  
the position of and value placed  
on children in this society.  
Workshop leaders Dina Yahav and  
Raya Bujanover stressed that be-  
cause of its size (small), climate  
(mild), religious and political  
homogeneity (a Jewish state), and  
emphasis by citizens on serving  
their country and fighting (lit-  
erally) for her existence, Israel  
has a set of conditions which  
fosters a close-knit community  
experience for her citizens in  
which children are seen as a  
precious resource and belonging  
to the future of the nation as  
a whole.

Yahav and Bujanover spoke of  
Israel as an “open” society, in-  
formal and family-like. The  
people live closely together, know  
each other and are not as indivi-  
dualistic nor as isolated as in  
the U.S. The children are taught  
to see all other adults as “parents”  
and the adults take care of chil-  
dren--whether they are biologic-  
ally their own or not: it is al-  
most a civic responsibility.  
Children are always traveling  
in large groups--to and from  
school, home and play. Entire  
grades and schools can be devoted  
to one neighborhood or large  
housing project. This intense  
socialization produces life-long  
friendships. The stimulation  
from school, organized activities,  
and interactions are considered  
essential to child development.  
Small children are placed in day  
care just for the stimulation and  
attention, rather than keeping  
them "protected" and isolated in  
an individual home.

Children are doted on and  
fussed over. Increased child-  
birth is encouraged by the culture  
and the government. Children are  
taught group responsibility, and  
are made to help each other in  
school and out to foster a spirit  
of camaraderie. They spend six  
years in elementary school, three  
years in middle school, and three  
years in high school.

In this idyllic setting how-  
ever, children must learn respon-  
sibilities early. By eight years  
old some are taking themselves  
to and from school with their  
peers--like "latch-key” kids in  
the U.S.

By the second year of high  
school, they must choose their  
career orientation, because high  
schools in Israel are more compar-  
able to U.S. technical schools.  
There is a great emphasis on  
math and science, and it is  
career oriented. Also, right  
after high school, young adults  
must serve in the military.

After this service, at 20 or 21  
years old, then they go to college.  
Yahav and Bujanover were able  
to transfer much of their enthu-  
siasm for their system of child  
rearing to their workshop group.  
They seemed to feel it was some-  
thing you had to see for yourself  
and experience because it is a  
different attitude about life  
which supports and reinforces  
everything about Israel and makes  
it “work” for them. It also  
shows that changing attitudes is  
the root for all change of insti-  
tutions and from which changes in  
the physical conditions will come.

One of the morning workshops  
of “Directions ‘86: Issues of  
Choice for Jewish Women" was  
“Jewish Women Writers." Divided  
into three segments, this workshop  
dealt with Jewish women writing  
poetry, fiction, and academic  
writing.

Area poet Barbara Holendar led  
by stating that, "A woman poet is  
a poet; there is no such thing as  
being a poetess." She then read  
several poetry selections by con-  
temporary Jewish women, taken from  
Voices Within the Ark: The Modern  
Jewish Poets (editors Howard  
Schwartz and Anthony Rudolph),  
although she did acknowledge that  
this anthology contains too few  
women poets. Holendar ended by  
reading some of her own poems  
from her collection entitled  
Shivah Poems, the most poignant  
of which dealt with her will and  
ability to live her own life after  
becoming a widow.

Next came the fiction segment,  
given by local writer Ruth Geller.  
Geller is the author of novels  
Seed of a Woman and Triangles,  
short story collection Pictures  
from the Past, and the forthcoming  
non-fiction work Against the Odds:  
The Story of the Syracuse Peace  
Council. She has also been a  
frequent contributor to Common  
Ground. In her introductory  
remarks, she spoke about what it  
means to be a Jewish writer. She  
feels that being Jewish has crea-  
ted her writing, that it is "…  
not only central to my writing,  
it is all-pervasive." Finally,  
Geller evocatively read her own  
short story, “The Locker Room,”  
soon to be published in Genesis  
2, a Boston Jewish progressive  
publication.

Finally, “Maxine Seller, Pro-  
fessor in the Graduate School of  
Education and Adjunct Professor  
in the Department of History at  
SUNYAB, discussed academic writing  
by Jewish women. Because Seller's  
field is history, she pointed out  
that not only are many women wri-  
ting in this discipline, but they  
have been doing so since before  
the women's movement (to wit, well-  
known historian Barbara Tuchman,  
who was born in 1912).

Many factors have contributed  
to the number of Jewish women  
writing about history. First,  
Judaism emphasizes history. Also,  
Jewish women who were immigrants  
were attending college in the  
1920's and 1930's, a generation  
earlier than most other immigrant  
women because of both Jewish value  
on education and economic ability.  
Finally, Seller felt that because  
Jewish women are "marginal," that  
is, that they are a double minor-  
ity (both women and Jewish), they  
look at society more critically,  
from the viewpoint of outside the  
majority.

Seller introduced a reading  
list of Jewish women historians  
emphasizing the work of Tuchman  
(especially her lengthy but very  
readable and people-centered A  
Distant Mirror, about 14th cen-  
tury European society) and Gerda  
Lerner, the "Mother of Women's  
History," who has tried to rede-  
fine the way that history is told  
and to rediscover missing women  
throughout history. Included in  
this reading list were Seller's  
own books, To Seek America: A  
History of Ethnic Life in the  
United States, and Immigrant  
Women.

As one not raised in the  
Jewish faith, I was occasionally  
bemused by the wealth of imagery,  
especially in the poetry, from  
Judaism. Yet as a woman, as well  
as one who is half-Jewish by birth,  
I was both intrigued by such  
images and enlightened by the  
variety of writing being done by  
Jewish women. Sharon Green

while teen motherhood is rising for  
both whites and Hispanics. Ms. Pro-  
vizer pointed out that the trend is  
the result of contraceptives and sex  
education becoming less available to  
young women.

The second cause of the feminiza-  
tion of poverty is discrimination in  
the workplace. Ms. Provizer noted  
that there are 50 million women in  
the labor force who average less than  
2/3 of male income. Echoing Holtzman,  
she stated that a woman with 4 years  
of college averages a $14,235 income  
versus $16,160 for a male high school  
graduate. It is only a myth that  
there is a lack of trained women for  
good jobs, she said, pointing out  
that in 1983, 93% of women construc-  
tion workers were unemployed although  
Secretary of Labor Donovan said there  
were no qualified women in the field!  
In the white collar arena, the differ-  
ences remain: a male attorney averages  
$547/week while a female makes $140  
less; women MD's average $401 weekly  
compared to the $561 for their male  
counterparts.

Part of the problem is that young  
women are sex-stereotyped during the  
educational process which traps them  
in lower paying jobs later. Teaching  
approaches and materials are still  
sexist, discouraging young girls.  
Despite Vocational Education Act am-  
endments, there has been no progress  
due to the Administration's 1972 Sex  
Equity Act being undermined by the  
Supreme Court decision allowing Fed-  
eral money to schools that discrimi-  
nate against women. Attempts by a  
coalition of women, the disabled and  
others to achieve favorable legisla-  
tion have been foiled consistently  
due to the attachment of anti-abor-  
tion riders.

Ms. Provizer discussed how the  
lengthened life span of women has  
contributed to the poverty of the el-  
derly. Many are widows with no savings  
who once were in comfortable circum-  
stances. 40% of women over 65 are  
poor versus 20% of the men. 75% of  
those dependent on Social Security  
are women, a program consistently  
under attack by the current Admini-  
stration in Washington. Budget cuts  
in Medicaid, Medicare, food stamps  
and similar programs have led to a  
situation where "the safety net is  
now flat on the pavement.”

Ms. Provizer went on to discuss  
the "Jewish dimension" to the prob-  
lem. She noted that there is little  
data on Jewish women and the femini-  
zation of poverty, but the “Jews  
on the Edge" project in Chicago,  
Atlanta and St. Louis found 17% at  
or below the poverty level. Although  
overall Jews are secure and even  
privileged, the percent of elderly  
is higher than virtually any other  
group and this should be viewed  
seriously since no group is immune.

It is our responsibility, Ms. Pro-  
vizer said, to maintain Affirmative  
Action, promote pay equity, ensure  
Federal job training, pass the Civil  
Rights Restoration Act and create a  
dependent care policy. Although so-  
called women's issues are not a pri-  
ority in the Jewish community, "we  
must educate and advocate, and not  
just in Jewish women's groups." It  
is the responsibility of women to  
find out where there is consensus,  
and then make sure we live up to our  
values by funding programs such as  
childcare. Women must share models  
that work.

Ms. Provizer concluded by saying  
that women's leadership and supportive  
men are needed to reverse the trends  
of the feminization of poverty. “Un-  
less we try to assert power in struc-  
tures, we'll only achieve modest pro-  
gress...these issues must be national  
priorities because they are good for  
women, good for the family, and good  
for American society.”
