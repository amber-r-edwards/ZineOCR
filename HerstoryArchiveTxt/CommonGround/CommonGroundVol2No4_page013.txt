A LETTER FROM

THE COUNTRY

By Joan Dickenson

[Ed. note: we are always excited
when we get a letter from Joan--
it is so easy to feel isolated
from each other and each other's
experience. Although this is our
December issue, this letter goes
so perfectly with an end-of-year,
getting ready for winter issue,
and we just couldn't wait a whole
year to share it!]

I am a November woman,
drab and dumpy...

That line is from a poem I wrote
a couple of Novembers ago. November
is my favorite month.
Except for a few stubborn survivors
on the white oaks, all the leaves
are gone; you can see the bones of
the trees, the bones of the hills...
their shape, their truth.

Grey skies, rain. No more cur-
tain of frivolous leaves between me
and the hills opposite; I can see
again. I can hear again, too --
no more birds, except the winter
contingent of nuthatch-chickadee-
woodpecker. No one can sneak up
on me now, using the feathered
concert to cover footfall on soft
bare ground. With the forest floor
inches deep in dry leaves, even a
chipmunk sounds like a thrashing
elephant. I like the openness of
the November wood,

...when a thing is truly
naked//and by the very
completeness of its ex-
posure covered up//when
nothing being not seen
makes nothing seen...

Like most things I love, Novem-
ber has a bad side. It's small
game season now, and soon, for a
fear-filled few weeks, it will be
deer season. Deer season, when
burly orange-coated men (who in
real life work for National Fuel
or the Amherst Town Highway Dept.)
will park on our road, ignore our
"posted" signs, and halloo through
our woods, one group driving the
deer, the others shooting any
animals that are flushed out by the
appalling noise. The local hunters
know we live here and avoid the
house, but city visitors don't
know. The house matches the woods--
all brick, stone, and unpainted wood
--beautiful and right, but in late

November I sometimes wish the house
were hot pink, or electric aqua, the
more hideous the better as long as
it's visible.

Deer season, when in theory the
poor of the parish will stock their
larders. Deer season, when in truth
the rich of Rochester will take
home the antlered heads for wall
display, leaving the carcass--or at
best, carting it to the dump. Deer
season, when on Opening Day I once
counted 52 shots in three hours.
Deer siege.

Enough negatives. November is
wood month, at least for grasshoppers
like us. (The provident cut their
wood the previous year, letting it
season; we're still thinning out
dead trees, so we don't have to do
that, but still we should be finished
by November -- and we never are.)

I sit at my desk, Bach on the tape
player and the kettle on the stove,
humming its formless song.

Getting wood should be a family
project, but all too often it's
just a family fight. Did you ever
try to make an eleven-year-old un-
load a wagon? "Why doesn't Justin
have to help?" she whines, ignoring
the fact that Justin helped load
the wagon, down in the woods. She
lifts a log as big around as a

Susan Anthony dollar. "I have to
do my homework,” she complains,
although normally homework is the
last thing she wants to do.

As we unload, we stack the little
pieces, ready to burn, and set aside
the big chunks to split. I like
splitting wood; it's one of the few
traditionally masculine jobs I do
well. It's a rhythm; set the log
on the block, raise the splitting
axe, thwack! -- pick up a piece,
toss it on the pile, and set up
another log. Step forward, bend,
step back, raise the axe; execute,
recoup, prepare. It's a dance...
useful, graceful, fun (like most
things) if you're good at it.

Of course the log doesn't enjoy
it, any more than the deer enjoys
being hunted...but you have to
draw the empathy line somewhere.

I try to keep it moderate: too
much empathy and you're suffering
all the time for no useful purpose;
too little, and you're exploiting
a friend who can't talk back.

The last log's done. Inside.
Whoo -- warm in here! Strip off
wet gloves, set boots near the
stove. Cool off. Drink some
tea. Put a pot of beans on the
stove-- a shame to waste all that
heat. It's a little
chilly now: put on the chamois,
the wool, the beloved tattered
sweatshirt...ready for winter,
glad it's coming, but sad as
well, for it's another whole year
until November comes again...

Home Birth

*From Page 12

consider this an inconvenience; in
fact, I rather enjoyed all this prepar-
ation. It made me feel so much more in
control of my birth experience, and it
also enabled me to more positively an-
ticipate labor and delivery.

KREKKKKKKKKRKHRKRKKRE

Before our home birth, the most
frequent questions that I was asked,
especially by those closest to me,
always began with, "What if...?".

Of course, there can be complications
that are unavoidable, no matter how
healthy and well-prepared a couple is,
and a woman pondering home birth must
realistically accept this fact. Thus
it is essential to discuss contingency
plans well in advance with your midwife
or attending physician. Not only is
it necessary to prepare yourself emo-
tionally for the possibility of hav-
ing to go to the hospital at any point,
it is also vital to have other prepar-
ations for a quick departure (for ex-
ample, phone number for an ambulance
service, a full tank of gas in your
car, arrangements for other children,
etc.). Although only a small percent-
age of home births require shifting
to a hospital, you need to be ready,
to ensure both your safety and the
safety of your newborn.

Although home birth is not for
everyone, it certainly could be a
reality for many women. The fact that
most pregnant couples don't even con-
sider it as an option is unfortunate.
For the healthy pregnant woman who is
not satisfied with traditional medical
procedures, home birth should definite-
ly be considered. For me, Ellen's
birth was one of the most memorable
and beautiful experiences of my life
so far. I'd like for more women to be
able to feel the same about their
children's births.

Many of the factors that might pre-
clude a home birth are discussed in the
books mentioned at the end of this
article.

This procedure is also described in
detail in Special Delivery by Rahima
Baldwin, which was our text for our
childbirth class.
