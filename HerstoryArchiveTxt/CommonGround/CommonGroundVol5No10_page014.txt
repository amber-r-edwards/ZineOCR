JUNE 24TH: WOMEN MUSICIANS WANTED  
TO SHARE MUSIC & TALENT. If you  
play an instrument or sing and are  
interested in meeting other women  
musicians, come and participate in  

a “sing-around"; which is kind of a  
casual jam session/song exchange.  
Tuesday, June 24 at 7:30 pm, 675  
Richmond, lower. Call Susan Clements  
at 882-2420 for more information.  

Kudos to Marie Rice of WIVB  
(Channel 4) for her recent  

series on "Date Rape" which gave  
credence to the fact that many women  
can be raped by an acquaintance on  
a date. It was also heartening to  
know that thousands of Western New  
York viewers heard rape defined as  
a crime of violence and power and  
not of sex.

WomenSpeak, a half hour weekly radio  
program sponsored by U.B.'s Women's  
Studies, presents contemporary national  
and local issues of interest to women  
and the WBFO listening audience.  

The program explores issues that  
affect women and their lives. Women  
are given little opportunity to speak  
in today's world, and more importantly  
to be listened to. Women are exposed  
continuously to interpretation of  
their lives. Their problems and ex-  
periences that are uniquely their own,  
and understood by other women, often  
receive misinterpretation from sources  
other than their own voices. To give  
a balanced view of women's lives to  

a listening audience, WomenSpeak will  
give an in-depth view of a single  
issue during each program. The pro-  
gram will be a magazine style format.  
The discussion may be literary, dra-  
matic, musical, analytical, sociolo-  
gical, historical or a combination  

of these. The program is aired on  
alternating Sundays, at 4:30 pm on  

FM 88.  

The Tonawanda Mothers and Others  
Club, sponsored through the YWCA

atives. Meetings are at Good Shep-  
herd Lutheran Church, 2669 Sheridan  
Drive, Tonawanda. For more info,
