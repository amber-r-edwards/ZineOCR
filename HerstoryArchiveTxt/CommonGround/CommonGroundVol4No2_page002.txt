local pro-choice

clinic targeted

By Mary Dickson

This is a very difficult story
to write; all in all I've spoken
with about ten Right-to-Life
people and at least an equal
number of Pro-Choice people.

I feel that I should draw
a diagram complete with his-
torical fact, medical fact,
legal fact, rumors and "it
was said to me" sections.

This article is factual but
under the circumstances some
of my commentary is included.

Buffalo GYN Womenservices PC
is one of the targets of the
Western New York State Right-
to-Life group. This group
has picketed Womenservices
at 260 Elmwood Avenue, the
area at Erie County Medical
Center where abortions are per-
formed and a clinic at 50 High
Street.

Womenservices is the prime
target according to the Right-
to-Life group because of its
highly visible location.

The Right-to-Life group here,
membership unknown, is based
on the philosophy that abortion
is murder, should be outlawed,
that abortion mentally and
physically tortures women and
that abortion is a male way of
pressuring women.

The picketing is almost
daily at 260 Elmwood and has
been since June. Several
picketers on weekdays and bet-
ween 30 and 50 on Saturdays.

Three demonstrators were ar-
rested September 7; one at the
clinic and two at the home of
the clinic administrator.

The group's weapons—pamphlets,
signs, a bullhorn and presence.
The defense is nearly nil—

the Pro-Choice Communication
Network (PCCN) acts as an escort
service for the women arriving
for abortion appointments.
PCCN's main goal is to ensure
that birth control and abortion
services remain accessible.

The women arriving for appoint-
ments are facing a difficult
time—undoubtedly they will
never forget the details of the
day. They have faced a major
decision and are at the last
steps of carrying out that de-
cision.

The picketing started after
$1400 was paid to Joseph
Scheidler for a May appearance.
(The Right-to-Lifers, however,
claim they have been there all
along.) Scheidler is the

author of Closed: 99 Ways to Stop
Abortion and credits himself
with closing 18 Chicago area
abortion clinics.

The Western New York Right-
to-Life group is following his
book—being abusive to employees
and clientele, trespass, intim-
idation and also using a bullhorn.

Buffalo Police state that
a bullhorn is beyond the
limits of free speech.

The bullhorn is the worst
weapon the group has as it makes
them heard up and down Elmwood
Avenue, throughout the plaza
and inside the Womenservices
office.

Women going to their appoint-
ments, waiting for their abortions
and worse yet undergoing the
actual abortion procedure can
hear the bullhorned, “ABORTION
IS MURDER," “BABY KILLER,"
“MURDERER," and a choice bit
of imitation, that of a baby
type voice screaming, “MOMMY,
DON'T HURT ME."

Nationally, Right-to-Life
claims 11 million members,
a 3 million dollar annual budget
and chapters in 50 states.

The group claims to be exercising
its right to free speech. And
it certainly is free speech.
Most of their claims can
absolutely not be documented.

They claim that around noon
on September 6 two women were
brought out of Womenservices
on stretchers and put into
Buffalo Columbus Hospital
ambulances because of botched
abortions. They were unable
to say why they believed
this was the case. They further
claim they have pictures of this
alleged event but refuse to
share them.

Womenservices spokespersons
deny that this occurred.
Neither of the doctors at
Womenservices, incidentally,
have privileges at Buffalo
Columbus Hospital.

Among other claims, that
women having abortions are not
told of the "dangers." Right-
to-Life claims that abortions
cause premature labor, disrup-
tion of the menstrual cycle,
perforation of the uterus,
miscarriage and infertility.

However, two health manuals
Womancare and The New Our Bodies,
Ourselves put the danger of
complications at less than 1%
for first trimester abortions
and cite only infection,

retained tissue and perforation
as dangers. Abortion does not
cause infertility although sev-
eral abortions may slightly
increase the chance of mis-
carriage or premature birth.

Right-to-Life claims that a
woman who has had an abortion
will suffer mental damage and
be haunted forever by feelings
of having killed her child.

More realistically, there may
be initial mixed feelings but
a severe or lengthy depression
is much more likely after child-
birth.

Some Right-to-Life members
told me of misleading information
given out by abortion clinics.

I couldn't validate their
claims such as, "I called a
clinic and said I was 19 weeks
pregnant. I asked what my baby
looked like and was told it
looked like a tadpole covered
with furry angora."

In fact, the most misleading
information I found over the
phone was by calling a recorded
message by the Buffalo Right-

to-Life committee called "Abor-
tion-Ask First." The message
gave information such as "suc-
tion 29 times more powerful

than a vacuum cleaner" is what
kills the baby and that it may
"cry and whimper" before it dies.
This message also claimed a 400%
increase in ectopic pregnancy,
infertility and hepatitis from

an abortion.

Two other pregnancy crisis
lines are run by the area
Right-to-Life group and I was
immediately counseled by phone
not to have an abortion because
they would help me.

Various members told me of
15 women they had saved from
abortions through street coun-
selors. One person told me the
15 had been saved since June
and all had their babies already!
Another told me some had delivered
and still another said they were
waiting for all the births.

I asked to speak with a woman
who had a success story to tell,
and did receive a phone call
from a woman who told me that
she decided on her own to
keep the baby and had called
the Right-to-Lifers on the
phone. She said they helped
her find a place to live and
gave her some maternity clothes.
When I tried to contact this
person again, I was told by
a Right-to-Lifer that the woman
didn't want to speak to me.
