There are few women who don't
worry about how much they eat and

what size they are. The multi-billion
dollar diet industry has successfully
divided us into two groups: women

who are unhappy being fat and women
who are afraid of getting fat. And
that is why fat is an issue for all
women.

The media says that fat is un-
attractive. That is a matter of
opinion. But the more enlightened
say fat is unhealthy. In fact, a
recent story on the network news
stated "Obesity is a killer disease"
causing heart attacks, hypertension,
diabetes and certain forms of cancer.
However, a closer look at medical
research indicates that many questions
remain unanswered.

First, let's look at who gets
studied. The most accessible fat
people are those who are in clinics
for weight loss surgery or who are
seeing a diet doctor. These people
have probably tried dieting unsuccess-
fully several times before seeking
professional help. Because your body
is actually starving, dieting is very
damaging to your health. In fact,
repeated dieting leads to heart at-
tacks and strokes. (US Dept. of Health
Education & Welfare, Obesity and
Health, p. 40)

Added to chronic dieting, those
studied live in an environment in
which they are persecuted. Fat peo-
ple are ridiculed throughout the
media and portrayed as constantly
eating, lazy, lacking in self-control
and stupid.

The result of this oppression is
self-hatred. Like other oppressed
groups, many fat people accept socie-
ty's disdain for fat and believe the
myths that if only they would eat less
or different foods, like thin people,
and exercise, like thin people, they

want us to be able to learn from one
another, and to support one another

in our struggles. I want a strong
women's movement in Western New York."

We are all battered women in one
way or another-- battered physically
and emotionally, economically and
psychologically by a society that
values money and power above life
itself. But it is essential that we
reach out to one another past our
differences, not only for our own
personal growth, but for the urgent
work that is before us.

We have to turn the world around.
It's not like in the 18th or 19th cen-
turies when injustice and oppression
and exploitation, and the greed for
power and profit from which they
sprang, can go on and on in the hope
that someday people will change.
People must change now. Injustice,
oppression and exploitation have in
the 20th century reached a place
where they threaten the very existence
of life on earth, and if we don't
each of us do our own small part in
stopping them now, I feel sure we
won't get another chance.

The work before us is enormous.

Fat: Disease or Diversity? 

wouldn't be fat anymore. If fat
oppression were not terribly painful,
would fat people go to such extremes
as getting their jaws wired or sto-
machs stapled in order to lose weight?
Would they risk drug dependency?

Perhaps the stress resulting from
fat oppression is what creates health
problems. In fact, diseases charac-
teristic of fat people are found in
other oppressed groups, for example,
black people. ("Hypertension: Biggest
Killer of Blacks" Ebony, June 1973)
Women under stress who have demanding
jobs but get little support from
their bosses are three times more
likely to develop heart disease.
("Heart Study Gives Weight to Where
Fat is At" The Buffalo News, Jan. 17,
1985)

The Roseto study found that in a
community where most people were fat
and fat was well-accepted, the rate
of heart attacks was actually lower
than the national average.

There is some disagreement amongst
the medical community. As reported
in The Buffalo News (1/17/85) Dr.

Ulf Smith, after studying 3000 Swedish
men and women, concluded that "The
degree of obesity does not mean very
much as a risk factor for cardiovas-
cular disease." He asserts that the
danger lies in where the fat is loca-
ted--that people with pot bellies are
more prone to heart disease than

those with fat thighs and hips... 
Further, Dr. Smith pointed out that
earlier studies connected pot bellies
with diabetes and high blood pressure.

In this same article, Dr. Antonio
Gotto Jr. suggests that it is the rate
of estrogen and testosterone that is
related to disease and that weight
is secondary, since it is men who
tend to accumulate fat on the abdomen
while women get fat on hips and thighs.
But suppose for a minute that

Oftentimes we feel trapped, knowing
in our hearts what we must do, but
fearful and overwhelmed, taking
refuge in the many escapes that so-
ciety has provided for us. I am a
writer. And sometimes I feel so dis-
pairing, so hopeless, that I sit at
my desk and just stare into space,
convinced that my energy is useless,
my efforts futile. But I believe
that that kind of complete and utter
hopelessness is the disease of our
age. There is so much to be done --
where do we start?

I didn't understand what I was
feeling until a friend from WAND
said she was in a way experiencing
the same kind of thing politically.
"There's so much to do!" she said.
"And every time I see that man on
TV and he comes out with another
unbelievable comment, I just freeze."

I realized that this was how I
felt: frozen, incapacitated, without
faith in the results of my own
actions. But recently I found a quote
from an ancient Jewish book of
learning, The Talmud, and I put it
on my wall, because I think it is
important to remember. It goes like
this: “You are not expected to com-
plete THE WORK in your lifetime.
Neither must you refuse to do your
unique part."

there are some health problems rela-
ted to fat. What's the solution?

We already know that dieting does not
work--that 98% of those who diet will
gain the weight back within 2 years.
(Margaret MacKenzie, Ph.D, "Obesity
as Failure in the American Culture"
Obesity/Bariatric Medicine, Vol or
No. 4, 1976) As stated above, re-
peated dieting is proven to be un-
healthy.

Other "cures" include surgical
procedures such as intestinal bypass
and gastric bypass (stomach stapling).
The side effects of these operations
include liver damage, kidney failure,
stomach perforation and malnutrition.
The intestinal bypass has a 10% mor-
tality rate and the gastric bypass
has a 3-4% mortality rate.

And for all the risks, there is
not evidence that these surgical pro-
cedures increase life expectancy.
(Susan & O.W. Wooley, Women's Studies
Quarterly, 1979) “Too often the oper-
ation converts a healthy fat person
into a sick thin person." (S.A. Medi-
cal Journal, July 23, 1977) In fact,
no one has proven that a fat person
who manages to lose weight, regard-
less of the method, then becomes
healthier.

In order to ascertain any connec-
tion between fat and disease more
studies need to be done on fat people
who have not dieted, are not under
a great deal of stress and are self-
accepting. “To create an environment
which encourages self-acceptance, we
need to expose the myths which fuel
fat oppression. And we need to ques-
tion those who tell us that people
who don't conform should, for their
own good, of course.

None of us can do it all. But we
can each do our own unique part. And
together, we can make a difference.

Belonging to WAND has given me hope.
And in this world, that's the only
thing that keeps me going, keeps me
active, keeps me fighting. It's
the only thing that works for me, the
hope that somehow, women working to-
gether will make it happen, that
women will turn the world around, or
at least keep life going so that an-
other generation has the chance to do
what we could not.

Is the women's movement in Western
New York dead or alive? I don't
know what it is now, but I know one
thing: it’s got to be alive. We've
got to make it come alive. Our work
is too important to let it die. Our
goals are too essential. Our lives
-- and the lives of those we love --
depend on it.
