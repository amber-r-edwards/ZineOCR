WUORSES

Members of Nurses United, Local
1168 of the Communication Workers
of America, have been on strike
against Buffalo General Hospital
and the Deaconess division since
May 1st, when negotiations on the
nurses' first contract broke down.

Local 1168 has been attempting to
come to a contract agreement with
the hospital since 1981. In March
1983, the union presented to the
hospital administration a 30-day
notice that a grievance existed. A
ten-day notice was then given to
advise them of a picket line. The
nurses voted ten to empower the
bargaining committee to call a
strike. Negotiations broke down
and the nurses went out.

Because of the decreased patient
load in both facilities, 1,100
additional hospital workers have
been laid off. These employees and
the striking nurses will be eligible
to collect unemployment benefits,
starting the week of July 5th.

The hospital will be paying the en-
tire tab for the insurance benefits,
as they had not opted to pay into
the state fund.

The nurses have accused the hos-
pital of attempted strike-breaking,
charging that the administration is
trying to distract attention from
the issues. The hospital has hired
nurses to fill strikers’ positions,
attempted to divert negotiations by
threatening financial reorganization
and they announced that nurses who
are on strike will be placed on a
“preferential list."

COMMON GROUND = JULY 1983

The hospital has accused nurses
on the picket lines of harassment
and unprofessional behavior.

There have been frequent break-
downs in the bargaining sessions.
Federal mediators have been involved
in the process since the beginning.
The major issues unresolved are a

back to work plan and the wage settle-

ment.

Nurses United are demanding that
all strikers be returned to their
former positions within one month

of returning to work, but the hospi-

tal says returnees may have to wait
up to a year to return to their old
jobs, although without going through
transfer limitations.

Wages are still an issue. Origin-
ally the nurses asked BGH for an
11.5% increase retroactive to Janu-
ary 1983, with a two-year contract.
The hospital offered 6% with slight
increases through a 3-year contract.

Of course, you'll 
become a 
vegetarian dog...!

Bargaining has closed the gap
somewhat. The nurses are presently
asking for a 2-year contract with 7%
each year. The hospital has offered
a 2-year contract with 7% the first
year and 6% the second.

Other issues, such as differen-
tials, vacation and sick time, em-
ployment policies, health insurance,
longevity increases, transfers and
promotions and union representation
have either been resolved or deferred
until the wage and back to work
agreements are settled.

The hospital administration has
charged the Nurses United bargaining
committee has not offered hospital
proposals to its membership.

The feeling among strikers is that
the hospital administration has never
taken their demands seriously, until
they went out on strike in May.

One nurse offered the opinion that
the demands were not met because
nursing has been traditionally
“women's work" and that it has never
been considered valid in male-oriented
value systems.

The strikers have received a lot
of community support. Fundraisers
and benefits have been held and
individuals and businesses have
offered their aid. Members from
other unions have shown up on the
picket line and sent letters of
support. Even the city council has
publicly supported the strike.

Many local nursing school grad-
uates have shunned jobs at BGH, and
the administrators at these schools
stand firmly behind the striking
nurses and their demands.
