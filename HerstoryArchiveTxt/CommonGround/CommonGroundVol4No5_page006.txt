Buffalo’s Metropolitan  
Community Church  

by Susan Prince  

INTRODUCTORY NOTE: In this ar-  
ticle I use the word "God" as a  
conscious choice. I have chosen  
not to use the popular god-goddess  
dichotomy adopted by some spiritual  
groups. In this essay, "God" refers  
to the ultimate force in the universe  
responsible for creation, is neither  
and both male and female. It is a  
word I reclaim now because it has  
once again been made meaningful to  
me.  

I have come to define spirituality  
as this: the art of maintaining morale,  
self-respect, and self-love; it  
is having the guts to face the truth  
of our own delicate posturing on this  
planet, of our own temporal existence,  
of our own ultimate responsibility for  
all that we do. It is both the most  
comforting and the most challenging  
way to live a life. And, like any art,  
it has a delicious and undefinable  
quality to it.  

Much of my Catholic upbringing  
seemed to be an endless rotation of  
sin and repentance, of doing good  
works, of a perpetual indebtedness  
to a mysterious God the Father who  
sat smugly on his throne dealing out  
uneven portions of grace and mercy.  
Getting out from under this idea was  
part of a conversion process to a new  
way of thinking. I became a feminist,  
a lesbian, and much more radical in  
my thinking. The notion of God didn't  
fit into this framework. Leaving  
Christianity was necessary in order  
to break from a long-standing, patri-  
archal past. The Church had become  
a dangerous anachronism robbing me  
of my deepest understandings of my-  
self. God was something to be out-  
grown, like a too-tight snowsuit my  
mother fitted me in, in a futile at-  
tempt to keep out the cold.  

I have come to know that this is  
not true. Rejecting God because a  
patriarchal culture has put males  
in the position of God doesn't make  
sense. It does, however, effectively  
rob us of some of our earliest and  
best-learned survival skills. I  
was surprised when I realized that  
my most critical sources of power  
came from skills I had learned in  
church: the mapping of a route  
inward, the tapping of an inner  
reservoir of strength, the quiet-  
ing of a noisy mind, an expanding  
sense of self--truly invaluable  
tools by any feminist standard.  

I kept seeing connections be-  
tween living things which simply  
could not be explained in ra-  
tional terms, and yet this vision  
seemed vital to my newfound under-  
standing and feminist perspective.  
At the same time I was keenly a-  
ware of the consequences of fail-  
ing to see the connections--the  
ensuing negativism, the loss of  
hope, the spiraling cynicism that  
can hook into any lost vision.  
God and feminist theory got clo-  
ser all the time.  

This awareness demanded some  
sort of reckoning. I investigated  
other spiritualities--Tao, Zen,  

Buddhism, Goddess worship, Witch-  
craft, Astrology, Spiritualism--  
and I found some good in all of  
these systems from which I knew I  
could benefit. But none of them  
touched me deeply, resounded in  
my bones the way Christianity did,  
and reclaiming it has been power-  
ful for me. I have come to under-  
stand that upbringing has a lot to  
do with one's personal experience  
of God. And although my defini-  
tion of God now differs substan-  
tially from the God I grew up with,  
it has been very comforting to find  
that I didn't have to go outside  
Christianity in order to find a  
feminine representation of the  
Divine.  

In Buffalo we are fortunate  
enough to have a vibrant and  
growing Christian church dedicated  
to the personal empowerment of les-  
bians and gay men. The church is  
the Metropolitan Community Church  
of Buffalo (MCC), and its very ex-  
istence contradicts the high-powered  
right-wing bigotry stealing through  
this country in a cloak of Christi-  
anity. The message is simple: God's  
love is for all people. In the gay  
and lesbian community, such news is  
vital--we experience unique brands  
of despair, loneliness, alienation,  
and discouragement. Knowing there  
are alternatives is the greatest  
empowerment of all. MCC is com-  
mitted to disarming old notions of  
God that oppress and exclude minori-  
ties.  

One way MCC heals is through the  
use of inclusive language. Inclu-  
sive language means not excluding  
anyone in our verbal representations  
of God. Inclusive language is used  
in all aspects of worship and is the  
official policy of the church; it  
means changing sexist, racist, able-  
ist, and heterosexist language when  
reading scripture or in any reference  
to God. Gone is the patriarchal "God  
the Father,” replaced by an inclusive  

"God the Creator" or "God the Infinite."  

Changing language is instrumental in  
changing our concepts of God, and it  
is the first step toward separating  
from a male persona of God.  

MCC recognizes the Bible to be  
the word of God, but also recognizes  
that throughout history translations  
have been made by human beings living  
in racist, patriarchal societies, and  
this has affected the language of  
present scripture. Inclusive language  
is an attempt to right that wrong. In  
many instances, the inclusive render-  
ing of a scripture verse is actually  
more correct than its patriarchal  
counterpart; studies of the original  
Greek and Hebrew versions of the Bible  
are unearthing more and more feminine  
representations of God than we have  
ever dreamed of.  

MCC Buffalo is part of a much larger  
denomination known as the Universal  
Fellowship of Metropolitan Community  
Churches (UFMCC). The UFMCC is the  
largest gay and lesbian organization  
in the world and adds more churches

More Thoughts  
On Women  
and Religion  

by Sharon Green  

I am a fallen-away Catholic  
struggling to reinstate religion in  
my life. Although half Jewish by  
birth, my adoptive parents raised  
me as a very traditional Roman  
Catholic. Any gaps were filled in  
by the nuns in my Catholic elemen-  
tary and high schools. Years of  
religion classes, weekly and some-  
times even daily Mass, mandatory  
sacraments and traumatic weekly  
confessions eventually resulted in  
burn-out.  

My first major break with  
Catholicism occurred when I became  
sexually active. It was indeed up-  
setting to have sex, only to be told  
the next day in school that burning  
in hell was my certain fate. How  
could I want and even like something  
so much if it were so wrong? After  
all, I had never desired to murder,  
rob, lie or cheat in school, yet  
these, too, were serious offenses  
against God and my church.  

In the late 1960s, I began  
college in my first secular insti-  
tution. My Church attendance dwin-  
dled, my life experiences expanded,  
my outlook on life became politicized  
and for the first time I became  
friends with non-Catholics and even  
atheists. The most questioning  
period in my life was underway. One  
thing I questioned was my religion.  

Eventually, I rejected formal  
religion. Although I still believed  
in God, I rarely, if ever, gave "Him"  
any thought. I had no need to. My  
life and my time were my own. I was  
young and selfish; I had a career  
and I had few personal problems to  
test my faith. Only when loved ones  
died did I consider the very existence  
of God and "His" mercy. During these  
years, my only prayers were uttered  
at hospital bedsides or in funeral  
parlors.  

Ironically, my career began with  
four years as an 8th grade teacher  
in a parochial school. Of course, I  
was required to teach religion, even  
though I wasn't qualified. Because  
the course consisted largely of dis-  
cussion of values, rather than hard-  
core dogma, I rather enjoyed teaching  
class. But I left religion behind  
when I left work every day.  

At 27 I became pregnant. The  
miracle of life twisting and turn-
