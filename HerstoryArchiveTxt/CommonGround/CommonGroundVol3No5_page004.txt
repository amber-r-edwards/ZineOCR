MARITAL RAPE LAW CHALLENGE

Buffalo NOW joined 36 other wo-
men's organizations, and has asked
New York's highest court to
strike down the criminal law which
permits most husbands to rape their
wives. Under the present law's
"marital rape exemption," a husband
may not be prosecuted for raping
his wife unless a court has ordered
the spouses to live apart.

The women's groups, represented
by attorneys for the Center for
Constitutional Rights and the
National Center on Women and Family
Law, submitted a "friend of the
court" brief in a criminal case
from Buffalo, People v. Liberta.
Liberta was prosecuted for raping
and sodomizing his estranged wife
in front of their child. He
could only be prosecuted because
his wife had a court order of pro-
tection against him. Liberta is
appealing his conviction to the New
York Court of Appeals, arguing
that because the law permits
most married men to rape their wives,
it deprives him of his constitutional
right to equal protection of the
laws.

State Attorney
General

On November 20, New York State At-
torney General Robert Abrams announc-
ed that he is bringing state charges
against former local polygraph oper-
ator Neil C. Hamilton. Hamilton al-
legedly sexually abused prospective
women employees for Mesmer Dairy
Stores, Inc.

Not only is he accused of verbally
abusing them by asking them irrele-
vant and unnecessary questions about
their sex lives, he is also accused
of physically abusing them by fond-
ling their breasts while applying the
polygraph straps around their chests.

Furthermore, Hamilton, a former
polygraph examiner for the Buffalo
Police Department, was alone in the
room with the female examinees. Be-
cause of this, the suit wants to
disallow Hamilton from testing any
more women unless another woman is
present and attaches the monitoring
devices.

Attorney General Abrams contends
that these women were hurt psycho-
logically and emotionally, and their
reputations were damaged. Meanwhile,
Mesmer's Dairy, which operates about
20 stores in the Buffalo area, con-
tinues to require that both its pro-
spective and current employees - male
and female - undergo lie detector
testing.

Island, New York.

The women's groups are the only
ones speaking for the victims of
marital rape. The prosecutor is
simply arguing that Liberta's con-
viction was proper because the
marital rape exemption is a valid
law. Besides Buffalo NOW, the
"friends" include many rape crisis
centers and battered women's shel-
ters. Also joining the brief are
such groups as the Women's Bar
Association of New York, the New
York State Coalition Against
Domestic Violence, and the YWCA of
Buffalo and Erie County, and New
York State NOW. The brief asks
the court to strike down the
marital rape exemption in its en-
tirety, so that all men who rape
may be prosecuted, and to affirm
Liberta's conviction.

If this legal challenge to the
exemption succeeds, other state laws
which still permit marital rape may
also be struck down. A decision is
expected from the Court of Appeals
in the spring.

Q Doctor Of The Year

For the first time, the American
Academy of Family Physicians has
named a woman as its "Family Doc-
tor of the Year." She is Dr. Jane
Triplett Carswell, of Lenoir,
North Carolina.

In addition to her duties as
a family physician, her accom-
plishments also include helping
her community (a town of only
15,000) set up a hospice, a
shelter for battered women, and
a housing development for low-
income people.

Dr. Carswell, who sought an
alternative for just one woman
patient who had been beaten but
had to return home, started the
Caldwell County Home for Battered
Women six years ago.

She also saw a need for low-
income housing among her patients,
particularly the single parents.
So twelve years ago, she helped
organize the Caldwell Community
Development Corporation, a low-
cost subdivision which does not
require down payment on homes.

Her accomplishments under-
score her philosophy that peo-
ple's dignity should be pro-
tected, and that people's health
improves when they “...have a
lifestyle that's healthy.”

achievements of such women as
Jane Addams, Helen Keller, and
Eleanor Roosevelt through por-
traits, printed texts, photographs,

WOMEN & THE INSTITUTIONAL CHURCH

by Sharon Green

On September 29, the Center for
Justice sponsored a day-long sem-
inar entitled "Today's Woman and
the Institutional Church" at Christ
the King Seminary in East Aurora.
The keynote speaker was Dr. Mary
Malone, former nun and Professor
of theology at the University of
Toronto, and a member of the Can-
adian Bishops' Taskforce on Women
in the Canadian Church. Her open-
ing address focused on the search
for the theology of women, the
effects on women of a male-domin-
ated, patriarchal church, the value
of feminist research in the area
of religion, and the irony in the
fact that "...churches are deprived
of the insights of most of their
members, the women."

A follow-up meeting was held
a few Saturdays later at the
University Christian Church in
Buffalo, Rev. Karen Lipinczyk,
Pastor.

Representatives from a variety
of religions, both lay women and
religious women, attended from as
far away as Batavia and South Wales.
There were, however, no Jewish
women participants.

A variety of current issues
and concerns of women in organized
religions were discussed. These
included: The ordination of women;
inclusive language, that is, non-
sexist language which includes both
women and men, in prayers and
liturgies; getting women to take
a broader and more active role in
church work; bucking the current
trend of religious conservatism
and the rapidly growing fundamental-
ist movement in this country;
networking, especially interde-
nominationally; fighting tokenism. 
For example, one Catholic nun who
is a pastoral minister said that
her title is almost meaningless in
terms of her influence on church
policy. She feels that she has
less input and influence on the
pastor of her church than his cook
or secretary; standing up to men
in the church hierarchy, that is,
not being intimidated or discour-
aged by those who do not feel that
such issues are important; con-
necting with other women who are
totally unaware of such concerns,
as well as with those women who
are conscious of them but are un-
comfortable with either talking
about or acting on them; support-
ing other women who face the same
issues; developing a bibliography of rele-
vant reading materials, so we can
all have a shared base of ideas
and information and research.

Because some women at this
meeting felt ready to act on
these concerns, while others felt
that they needed more time to
read, discuss, and refine their
feelings, the meeting resulted
in the formation of two groups.
The former group set as its goals
discovering specific ways to im-
plement some of the above concerns
in area churches. On the other
hand, the latter group, more of
a discussion and support group,
decided to begin by reading and
discussing two books: Kiss Sleep-
ing Beauty Good-bye, by Madonna
Kolbenschlag, and Jesus According
to a Woman, by Rachel Conrad Wah-
berg. Both groups set future
meeting dates and made plans to
continue the work begun that day.

Those interested in either of
these groups, or those who would
like to be included on the mailing
list of the Task Force on Women
and the Church, should contact:

Cosmetics

The Food and Drug Administra-
tion says there are no facts to
back up the allegations that
aborted fetuses and placentas are
used in the manufacture of cosme-
tics. The FDA, which regulates
the manufacture of cosmetics, said
that recent pamphlets and letters
to newspapers have accused the
industry of using aborted fetuses.

The source of the allegations
is a French book, titled The
Traffic in Unborn Babies, which
fueled an editorial in the Vati-
can newspaper and many rumors
in anti-abortion groups across
the country.

The substance allegedly culled
from the fetuses is called colla-
gen, the source of which is nor-
mally animal placentas, the FDA

AIDS

The New England Journal of
Medicine has published a report
that says health care profession-
als who deal with AIDS (Acquired
Immune Deficiency Syndrome)
patients run very little risk
of catching the disease, even if
they prick themselves with needles.

The researchers found that in
an average of more than six months
after exposure to AIDS victims,
none of the workers had gotten
the disease or developed antibod-
ies to the virus that may be the
cause of it.

Woman Charged

A Westchester woman is being
held on $300,000 bail for an
attempt to hire a hitman to
paralyze her physician husband.

The hitman that Debra Eanni
contacted and offered $1,200 for
breaking her husband's neck was
an undercover police officer.

She never explained why she wanted
him hurt, the officer said.
