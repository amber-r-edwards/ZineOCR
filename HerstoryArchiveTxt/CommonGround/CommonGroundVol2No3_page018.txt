Coalition for Abortion Rights and
Against Sterilization Abuse

GET INVOLVED
TO PROTECT
YOUR RIGHTS Set

WHO WE ARE

CARASA is a group of feminist activists
who advocate women’s right to safe & legal
abortion & who work towards ending the
abuse of sterilization in this country &
worldwide.

CARASA has been actively working to
counter the small but well-organized anti-
choice movement & its right wing backers.
However, CARASA is more than a pro-choice
group. We view the right of women to safe &
legal abortion as part of a broader & more
fundamental spectrum of reproductive
freedom.

WHAT YOU CAN DO

BECOME A MEMBER OF CARASA.
CARASA now offers four types of member-
ship: Active Member; Organizational Af-
filiate; Individual Affiliate; or Sustainer.
