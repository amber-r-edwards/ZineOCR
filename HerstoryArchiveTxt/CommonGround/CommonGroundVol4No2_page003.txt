Common Ground is pleased

to announce that we are now

carried at the South Buffalo

YWCA, located at 20 Mesmer

Avenue. Please encourage

your friends in the South Buf-

falo area to drop by there to
pick up their copy of CG.

This semester we will again
be working with a student in-
tern, this time affiliated
with the Women's Studies Col-
lege at UB. Any students out
there in women's studies, jour-
nalism, communications, adver-
tising or related fields who
may be interested in having
an internship experience with
Common Ground, please contact
us. We have worked with sev-
eral colleges in this area.

We think that CG offers a uni-
que opportunity for students

to see a small business/news-
paper in operation and to par-
ticipate in any and all aspects
of the newspaper.

Common Ground has organized
a new mailing this month to
groups and organizations of
interest to women in the Western
New York area. We would like

to reinforce the idea that we
can all network more effective-
ly to our mutual benefit. Those
of you affiliated with other
women-oriented groups in this
area may also want to mention

at meetings some of the sugges-
tions we included in this let-
ter:

-send us your calendar and
announcement items to publish

in CG each month.

-write an article describing

the philosophy and work of

your organization for submis-
sion to CG.

-loan us your mailing list and
we will do a one month mail-
ing free of Common Ground to
your group's members.
-consider: buying an organiza-
tional subscription to CG.
-organizations submitting regu-
lar announcements and calendar
items are asked to send a
yearly donation to the paper
if possible.

Congratulations are in
order for Judith Geer, local
librarian and frequent con-
tributor to CG, who was pub-
lished in the October issue
of MS. magazine. Her article,
"The Librarian and the Feds",
is of local interest and well
worth reading.

Dear Common Ground,
the woman who wrote last month
about her desire to spray

paint "The infamous van of a
South Buffalo man, because

the entire body graphically
depicts men standing over

nude women, who are on the
ground and in chains."

I say; bring on the spray
paint! I say a bunch of women
should go do it! Maybe after
spray painting the obnoxious
van, we should let it roll
into Lake Erie. It's about
time we as women stopped putting
up with these half-wit Neander-
thals who are oppressing and
humiliating us and denying
us our human rights in the
name of free speech.

I say enough is enough, and
if it takes guerrilla tactics,
so be it.

I want to say to the woman
who wrote that letter that her
anger is right and justified,
and that we all need more of
it:

I'd like to hear other
readers' comments on this.

An Angry Reader

POLICY

PHILOSOPHY - Common Ground is potentially, with
help from Western New York women, a forum to
celebrate the rich diversity of our community. We view
the paper as a ribbon that may connect our com-
monalities, our intersection points. We are inviting you
to participate actively in the building of a support system
for WNY women. We affirm our commitment to enhance
the lives of women on physical, educational, spiritual,
psychological, social and economic levels. We want to
present, fair-mindedly, the issues that concern women,
and information of value to women. We offer Common
Ground as a place where women can display their art
and personal literature, and review the tapestries of their
experiences.

EDITORIAL POLICY - Common Ground is especially
looking for articles which address the needs and interests
of local women.

1. Common Ground is a publication of news, culture
and dialogue from women’s perspectives.

2. News, Opinion, Analysis and Commentary will
each be clearly labeled as such.

3. We are seeking to provide accurate, straightforward
information of value to women.

4. The collective will not intentionally print or sup-
port materials or viewpoints which will harm women
because of color, sexuality, religious or ethnic
background, physical disability or economic situation.

5. While opinions expressed in Common Ground are
those of the authors and not necessarily those of the col-
lective as a whole, we do accept responsibility for choos-
ing what we print.

SUBMISSIONS — We welcome articles, letters, infor-
mation and announcements of interest to women.
Graphics, cartoons, art and photography will be grateful-
ly received. We especially invite women who do not
usually have access to traditional media - women of col-
or, differently abled, economically or educationally
disadvantaged, and those for whom English is a second
language - to write. Suggested length of letters: 250
words. Letters must be signed to be printed. We will,
however, respect your privacy and withhold your name
if you request. Suggested length of articles, commentary,

analysis: 500-750 words. Please type and double space

your work; 40 characters across. If you do not have ac-
cess to a typewriter, please print clearly. In time we hope
to have a typewriter, paper, etc., available for those who
request it. Include a stamped, self-addressed envelope
and work and home phone numbers. Because we want
to hear your voices, if your piece needs to be edited for
length or clarity, we will call you/ask you to do it. Keep
copies of your work. We will try to notify you within
three (3) weeks if we intend to use your work. If we print
it, we will give you five (5) copies of the issue in which
it appears. Artwork should be black and white copies
only, and title/describe your work. We will copyright the
entire issue, but the copyright on each piece reverts to
the author/artist, so that she may decide where her work
is printed. Please request a style sheet for further infor-
mation and guidelines if you want to write.
