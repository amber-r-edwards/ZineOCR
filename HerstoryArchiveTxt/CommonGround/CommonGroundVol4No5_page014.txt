ful with sage-leaved germander
and elecampane, and also with
succulents and alliums, in short,
members of the lily family, not
to mention briars, Chinese lan-
terns and bittersweet. Do not
take whole plants, and do leave
the parent plant well cared for.
This approach is not useful with
plants likely to grow only in
their natural habitat, e.g.,
trailing arbutus and wood betony.
Why disturb them? Don't!

You may, as well, order plants
by mail: choose reputable nurser-
ies. How will you know they are
reputable? Katherine S. White's
Onward and Upward in the Garden
(Parr, Straus, Giroux, 1979,
ror. Little, Brown), pp. 354-58,
will be helpful, if a little dated.
You will find a list of nurseries
specializing in herbs in Milo
Miloradovich, The Home Garden of
Herbs and Spices (Doubleday, 1952),
pp. 199-202: the list is very
dated but still useful. Your
friends' experiences and your own
common sense are also helpful in
choosing mail order nurseries.
Daphne dotes particularly on
White Flower Farm's “The Garden
Book.” The 1985 edition of the
catalogue is so beautiful as to
be visionary: it includes hard-
to-find broom among others; and
if you are after ferns, alliums
and daylilies, you will find many.
Write to White Flower Farm, Litch-
field, CT, 06759. The plants are,
however, expensive, which herb
gardens decidedly need not be.

Usually one local nursery will
be found to specialize in a variety
of herbs. The further out of town
the nursery, probably the less ex-
pensive its wares. Plant sales by

local garden clubs are usual in

many areas and worth frequenting
as healthy plants are the rule.
Also, remember, most garden clubs
are made up of women: these women
may appear conservative but have
a radical knowledge base about
nature. When traveling in the
countryside, be alert to discreet
signs that tell of an herb farm's

presence. (Herb farms are less
common in the U.S. than abroad,
as in France or Greece, Spain or
Yugoslavia; unfortunately, impor-

ting plants on your own is usually —

not a successful venture.) Plant
purchases from these farms may be
your least expensive.

For future reference, keep a
record of nurseries from which
you buy, of what you buy (and
pay), and of the results. Cros-
sing Press has an Herbal Sampler:
A Notebook for Women, ed. Elaine
Goldman Gill and designed by Jan
Twentyman MacDonald (1984). The
Kew Five-Year Gardener's Diary,
put out by the Royal Horticul-
tural Society, facilitates over-
time comparisons. A steno-
grapher's notebook will, how-
ever, do as well. Record keeping
also may track the propagation
and development of particular
plants or kinds of plants, their
yield, and how well they suit each
other, your garden's purpose and
you. This makes for pleasurable
reading come next January and is
always useful.

high stress jobs and for encouraging
women to be more like men. However,
as we know, feminism has been blamed
for many evils, and as long as people
feel threatened by feminism, this
will continue.

Meanwhile, the hazards of smoking
should be a feminist issue. Many
other things that harm women in any
way have been taken to task by femi-
nists. So let's add cigarette smok-
ing to that list.

Feminism promotes freedom of
choice for all women. We should be
free to choose whether or not to
smoke. But we need conclusive re-
search and lots of correct informa-
tion before we make this choice, and
before we risk our own health and
the health of others.
