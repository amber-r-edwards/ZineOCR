Days of the Dandies, written by
Mary Wortley Montagu (written by
herself) is a fascinating
collection of excerpts from Lady
Mary's letters edited by Arthur R.

Ropes, M.A., a late Fellow at
King's College, Cambridge, and
published through The Grolier

Society and Edinburgh Press of
London, England. This book spans
the life and times of Lady Mary,
born in sixteen-eighty-nine of the
aristocratic Whig family, the

Montagus, who ruled England for
half a century under Queen Anne and
George I.

Lady Mary's letters are rare,
provocative, and invaluable
accounts of eighteenth-century
aristocratic social life, and

service to the English monarchy.
Though the published letters of
Lady Mary offer little in the way
of intellectual gain, the letters

do provide exciting
socio-historical information
regarding contributions made by

eighteenth-century women to global
society.

Lady Mary's letters were written
from various locations in Europe
and the Orient during the 1700s
(where Lady Mary accompanied her
husband, Ambassador Edward Wortley
Montagu, on diplomatic missions for
King George I of England), but were
not published until c. 1900. Any
astute student of the early
European Enlightenment will quickly
discern parallels in Lady Mary's
letters between societal
contributions made by women of the
early modern period and
contributions that women make to
contemporary society that benefit
the lives of many people.

The letters from Lady Mary
Wortley Montagu can be viewed as
our feminist legacy, written in the
Mary Astell tradition.

In lines written to her
cherished dear friend in London,
Lady Mary wrote the following:

"I shall run mad -- with what
heart can people write, when
they believe their letters
will never be received? I
have already writ you a very
long scrawl, but it seems it
never came to your
hands...This will, perhaps
miscarry as the last did; how
unfortunate am I if it does!"

Lady Mary's feelings for her
sister are revealed in the passage:

"You will think that I forgot
you, who are never out of my
thoughts. You will fancy me
stupid enough to neglect your
letters, when they are the
only pleasures of my solitude;
in short, you will call me
ungrateful and insensible,
when I esteem you as I ought,
in esteeming you above all the
world."

Both sincerity and inspiration
are shared with Lady Mary's
sister-in-law and confidante in
London. Lady Mary conveys the
endless frustration incurred due to
unreliable mail delivery systems in
Europe and Britain.

"If I am not quite so unhappy
as I imagine, and you do
receive this, let me know it
as you can; for till then I
shall be in terrible
uneasiness; and let me beg you
for the future, if you do not
receive letters very
constantly from me, imagine
the post-boy killed, imagine
the mail burnt, or some other
strange accident; you can
imagine nothing so impossible
as that I forgot you, my dear
Mrs. Wortley."

I highly recommend a complete

reading of Lady Mary Wortley

Montagu; Select Passages from Her
Letters, or Days of the Dandies.

Days of the Dandies is a book one
can pick up for a good read, put
down, and return to time and time
again (and learn more about
herstory). I picked it up at
Lockwood Library at the University
at Buffalo, and I most definitely
was not disappointed.

New England Women

by Koré Archer

NEW ENGLAND LOCAL COLOR LITERATURE:
A WOMEN'S TRADITION by Josephine
Donovan. N.Y. Continuum, 1988.

158 pages, $9.95 paperback.

NEW ENGLAND LOCAL COLOR
LITERATURE: A WOMEN'S TRADITION is
Josephine Donovan's survey of six
pioneering feminists who
collaborated 100 years ago.

The New England "local color"
movement grew out of a general
trend in the 19th century away from
sentimental domestic literature and

toward more realistic regional
details, including authentic
dialect, local customs and real

geographic settings. The "local
color writers," a small group of
white feminists, used this new
trend toward realism to mock the
current glorification of weak,
male-identified heroines, to create
a woman-identified countervision of
their own, and ultimately to
document their despair and
recapitulation as the spread of
industrialization sabotaged
matriarchal loyalties.

These women, hardly the dour
Yankee types you might imagine,
were a genial, even frisky bunch.
"We want you to get over here and
into this house, where, with closed
doors, we sometimes make the
rafters ring with fun," wrote
Harriet Beecher Stowe to George
Eliot. Like feminist writers
today, the local colorists visited
and wrote back and forth,
encouraging each other's writing
and thinking. Together they
developed a subversive awareness
that has everything to do with
contemporary feminist literature.
Though "malestream" critics have
ignored this lively literary
school, several local color writers
- notably Harriet Beecher Stowe,
Rose Terry Cooke, Sarah Orne
Jewett, and Mary E. Wilkins Freeman
- produced works that are most
certainly masterpieces by any
standard of critical judgment.

Josephine Donovan, author of
Feminist Theory and Sarah Orne
Jewett among other books, shines
an overdue spotlight on these
defiant foresisters and their
dreams. Recommended reading for
anyone interested in women's
literature or the history of
feminism.
