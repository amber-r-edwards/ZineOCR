OF CIRCLES, CYCLES,  
MOTHER AND MAMA  

by Silversmith  

Adrienne Rich, in titling a work  
"Dream of a Common Language", raised  
a question which resounds beyond her  
writing. A question which is often  
echoed by wimmin -- what is our com-  
mon language? Does a common language  

exist? Do we use it, communicate  
with it? If so, what are we communi-  
cating? Such a common language is  

developing among feminist witches and  
linking our herstory to our future.  
This is not a spoken language. This  
is a language of symbol, intuition,  
magic and action.  

A group of wimmin gather, cast a  
CIRCLE, join hands solidifying the  
CIRCLE, the ritual begins, Energy;  
words, objects may travel that CIRCLE,  
A kiss passed around the CIRCLE may  
end the ritual.  

All cultures have CIRCLE dances.  
Children play CIRCLE games, Magic is  
worked in CIRCLES, and even wimmin  
of patriarchal religions meet in  
women's CIRCLES.  

Stonehenge is a CIRCLE, Avebury  
is a CIRCLE. Pre-historic earth-  
works in the U.S. are CIRCLES. CIRCLES  
are among the oldest stone carvings  
found throughout the world. The CIRCLE  
belongs to wimmin.  

A CIRCLE which continues and spi-  
rals becomes a CYCLE. - moon phases,  

seasons, menstruation, life and death.  
Earliest religions concerns and rit-  

uals throughout the world focused on  
the CYCLES of the moon as she emerged  

a crescent from darkness, grew to full,  
disappeared into darkness to be reborn  
a crescent. From Africa to the Orient,  
in Egypt, Europe, North and South  
America the moon has been known as female  
and her cycles seen corresponding to  
wimmin's cycles. The moon MOTHER of  
all CREATION, in her CYCLES gave wimmin  
the first calendars. these were the  
lunar calendars of 13 months of 28  

days - CYCLE of the moon, CYCLE of  
wimmin.  

From the CYCLES of wimmin come the  
mysteries of wimmin's religions -  

secrets and rituals shared among wimmin.  

She Had A Little Chant  

She had  

a little chant  
She chanted  

magic names  
She chanted  

more and more  
She wove  

her magic spells  
She wove them  

more and more  
She gathered  

little grasses  
She plaited  

little garlands  
She chanted  

all the while  

She chanted  

through the day  
She did not  

forget the night  
She sang  

as children will  
But it was  

more than that  
She invoked  

as women will  
But was more  

wont than that  
She never laid  

her chantey down  
But that it got her  

what she wont.  

Wimmin not only live closest to the  
CYCLES of the earth and cosmos be-  

cause of their own physical CYCLES,  
but wimmin bring forth life and food  
to nourish new life. Human MOTHERS,  
like the moon MOTHER,  
Earth MOTHER, moon MOTHER, hu-  
man MOTHER - the universe lived in  
her CYCLES. The mystery was, and is,  
Hers from within each individual to  
the cosmos itself. The CIRCLE, the  

CYCLE, the MOTHER.  

"MAMA!" Creation. "MAMA" Susten-  
ance. "MAMA!" Love. “MAMA!" Protec-  
tion. MAMA quilla, the ancient Per-  
uvian moon mother. MAMI, the Sum-  
erian creator of all. MA-Emma, Es-  
tonian earth mother. MAMLKI, another  
name for mother Kali. MADDER-Akka,  
controller of fertility in Lappland.  
MAMMA Cocha, oldest goddess of South  
America's Pacific Coast, source of  
all food. MAMitu, Chaldean destiny  
goddess. MAMAN Brgitte of Haitian  
Voodoo. MAMOKORIYOMA, great mother  
of Yanomamo.  

The MOTHER-word is universal. It  
carries with it more than the phys-  
ical motherhood potential of wimmin.  
In Eastern beliefs the sacred letter  
"Ma" represented the spark of life.  
Descent was from the mother and clan  
members could only inflict injury on  
themselves if they injured another.  
MA! Peace. To Persians, "MA" was a  
sacred word combining death-rebirth.  
It represented immortality gained  
through milk from the breast of the  
Goddess. MA! Continuing CYCLE of  
rebirth. In contemporary Voodoo the  
priestess in whom the Goddess resides  
is still referred to as MAMALOT.  
"MAMA!" Womyn Who is Goddess, God-  
dess in all wimmin.  

In another form "MAMMON" Read  
this way, the choice between worship  
of god and Mammon in the Bible becomes  
the choice between Goddess or Great  
Mother and the patriarchal Father-god.  

In the common language of wimmin,  
witches, followers of the Goddess,  
one could agree with McMann, that  
“objective reality ceases to signify."  
Symbols signify. In a cycle which  
exists outside time evocation leads  

to magical analogies, to poetic wis-  
dom, to synthesis. Patriarchy has  
given us history without religious  
experience, even when it is religious  
history. Feminist spirituality, draw-  
ing on archaic understandings of sym-  
bol, connect us with the cosmos and  
cosmic rhythm in an existential re-  
ligious experience.  

The sacred, and all is sacred in  
the Craft, is the real. "Absolute  
reality exists at the Centre; it is  
the territory of the sacred. Symbols  
of Absolute reality must be located  
at a Centre. The road to the Centre  
is difficult, hazardous, labyrinthine"  
(McMann, 1980). When feminist witches  
gather, or begin work alone, we cast  
a CIRCLE, we center ourselves individ-  
ually and/or as a CIRCLE of wimmin.  

We are Goddess, we are the sacred  
reality, we are the centre of the cos-  
mos. We come from the MOTHER.  
We are MOTHERS, daughters, sisters.  

Our work is healing, nourishing, bring-  
ing peace. Our common language derives  
from symbols and produces innate,  
intuitive knowledge.
