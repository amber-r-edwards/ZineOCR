OPPRESSION HURTS ALL OF US

We urgently need your help to eliminate
discrimination based on sexual orientation.

In July the NOW-NYS Council voted to raise
the money to hire a lobbyist to work on lesbian
rights during the 1985 legislative session.

Local chapters are holding fund-raising parties and we
would also love to hear from other organizations
interested in helping.

In addition, the Lesbian Rights Task Force has created a special "Committee of 500" to be comprised of the first 500 people
who send $50.00 or more to the NOW-NYS Special Lobbyist Fund. Below is a coupon and your chance
to help make this goal a reality.

Please give whatever you can, and find two more people who can match you.

Oppression hurts us all, and often those who would help simply haven't been asked.

COMMITTEE OF 500

Here is my check in the amount of
$50.00 for the NOW-NYS Special
Lobbyist Fund, Committee of 500.
Please add my name to the membership
list and send me a membership certificate.

I choose not to become a member of
the Committee of 500, but want to
contribute the following amount to
the NOW-NYS Special Lobbyist Fund:
