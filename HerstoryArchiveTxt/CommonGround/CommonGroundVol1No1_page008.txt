HEALTH RIGHTS

Is your right to Informed
Consent guaranteed under the
existing legal and medical
guidelines? Are present stan-
dards adequate to ensure truly
informed consent? Consider the
following problems which remain
unaddressed in the guidelines:

How much information is suf-
ficient to ensure informed con-
sent? Can a physician provide
all the information necessary?

Does the patient understand
the information she receives?
Medical terms, test results,
etc.? Is she truly informed?

Can a physician provide ade-
quate and unbiased information
on risks and alternatives?
Isn't she/he clearly biased,
since she/he has already chosen
a diagnosis and treatment?

Each one of these issues
alone could seriously jeopar-
dize chances of truly informed
consent. A woman cannot assume
that her physician will be sen-
sitive to these issues. Indeed,
there is no guarantee that she/
he will provide her with any
more than the minimal informa-
tion required.

“Clearly, a woman must work
to guarantee her own right to
Informed Consent. She must make
the effort to gather informa-
tion, to remove barriers to un-
derstanding and to minimize
bias.

You can develop confidence
and accept responsibility for
decisions about your body. Be-
gin with the following sugges-
tions:

1) Develop alternative medical
resources and establish a net-
work of health care providers.

Basic resources would include
women's health books, general
medical guides, a medical dic-
tionary and health journals.

Expand your list of health care
providers: patient advocates (in
hospitals and clinics), health
educators, self-help groups,
pharmacists and friends.

2) Choose your health care pro-
viders carefully. Look for re-
spectful care, the ability to
speak in terms you can under-
stand, a willingness to listen
and respond to your input (ques-
tions, comments, etc.) and pro-
fessional competence. Keep look-
ing and learn to rely on your
alternative resources to ful-
fill some of these needs.

3) Communicate with your health
care provider. Prepare for your
doctor's appointment by consult-
ing your alternative resources,
write down questions and infor-
mation to discuss with your doc-
tor. Bring a friend, bring a
pad/pencil to take notes. Do
not leave until your questions
have been answered. Restate to
your doctor, in your own words,
the information she/he has
given you.

4) Do not consent to any treat-
ment or procedure until you feel
that you have sufficient infor-
mation to make a decision. Re-
member, even if you have given
written or verbal consent you
can still refuse to begin or
continue any treatment or pro-
cedure.

Use these suggestions as a
foundation for your own guide-
lines. Create standards that
are suited to your needs. En-
sure your right to Informed
Consent.

Any time a woman's natural re-
sistance is lowered or weakened
by lack of sleep, poor nutri-
tion, emotional disturbances,
anxiety, travel or stress, she
is more susceptible to vaginal
infection. And, because the va-
gina is almost completely seal-
ed off, it remains dark, warm
and moist: a perfect environment
for the nasty organism, yeast.
Here are some common misconcep-
tions about vaginal health:
MYTH:

"I have to douche every week to
clean myself inside."

FACT:

Wrong. Douching upsets the bal-
ance and the scented types strip
the protective layer of cells,
(Similar to washing your mouth
out with soap.) A vinegar or
baking soda douche should only
be used if your doctor or nurse
prescribes it.

MYTH:

"I have to douche after sex and
at the end of my period."

FACT:

If you feel you must rinse out
these secretions, use only warm
water. But truthfully, a bath or
shower is sufficient. The vagi-
na cleanses itself.

MYTH:

"My underpants are nylon and
they have a cotton crotch."

FACT:

Not good enough. The nylon or
acetate blocks the circulation
of air. 100% cotton underwear is
best. And for the same reason,
pantyhose should be worn only
when necessary.

MYTH:

"I have to use feminine deodorant
sprays to smell nice."

FACT:

The perfume effect of those
sprays lasts one half hour at
best. They contain harmful chem-
icals that can irritate delicate
skin. Normal vaginal odor is
not offensive.

MYTH:

"I always feel damp ‘down there’
so I sprinkle talcum powder in
my panties."

FACT:

Again, talcum powder can be an
irritating substance and has
been linked to a 4 times greater
risk in developing ovarian can-
cer. Cornstarch is naturally
more absorbent and not harmful
to delicate tissue.

MYTH:

"I wear a panty shield liner
every day to keep that 'oh so
fresh-dressed feeling.'"

FACT:

And your vagina is screaming
for relief. Those liners com-
pletely block any air from cir-
culating.

MYTH:

"It doesn't matter how I wipe
myself after I go to the bath-
room."

FACT:

Dead Wrong! Always wipe from the
front to the back. Germs and
bacteria from the rectum can
cause a nasty vaginal or blad-
der infection if they are push-
ed near the vagina or urethra.
In any event, if you suspect
a vaginal infection to be pre-
sent (signs of copious discharge,
foul odor, itching or burning)
see your health care provider.
And don’t put anything in your
vagina for two days prior to the
appointment. Although it is near-
ly impossible to prevent all
things forever, being cautious
and considerate of your vagina
will no doubt reduce the chances
of an agonizing infection.

COMMON GROUND

The demand for homebirths is
quickly growing in Buffalo.
More and more couples
educated and middle class - are
opting for a family oriented,
family controlled birth experi-
ence. This parallels the move-
ment spreading throughout the
country.

Buffalo is set apart from
other cities, like Rochester,
in that homebirths are forced
to occur "underground". One el-
derly general practitioner and
several midwives attend home-
births on a regular basis.
However, the pressure exerted by the
obstetrical community against
homebirths is so vehement that
no OB's will openly backup home-
birth practitioners if compli-
cations necessitating hospital-
ization should occur.

This is an economic and pow-
er issue. MD's and hospitals
lose money to homebirths. It is
another instance of women's
choices being limited by the
system.

Consumers can turn this tide
by organizing to support those
involved in alternative birth-
ing, and by openly discussing
it with their doctors and prac-
titioners. Consumer pressure,
the power of the purse, is the
ultimate weapon.

The Buffalo Committee for
Birth Alternatives is a group
of consumers and professionals
committed to expanding our
birth options, both in and out
of hospital. All interested men
and women are urged to call
Teresa Epstein, 881-3585. Come
to our workshop on Sunday,
Sept. 26th, 7:30pm, Lafayette
Presbyterian Church, Elmwood &
Lafayette (see Calendar).

VICTORY: Nurse-Midwives 3rd
party reimbursement bill signed
by Gov. Carey. This means all
insurance companies must reim-
burse directly for the services
of a Nurse-Midwife. Until now
an MD had to be billed.

- PARENTAL CONSENT for Abortion
Bill defeated in NYS Assembly.
- PARENTAL NOTIFICATION of minors
seeking abortion is in commit-
tee in NYS Senate and Assembly.
- Bill prohibiting health insur-
ance to cover abortions was
passed by NYS Senate.

- The "Earnest Resistance" clause
has been removed from the New
York State Rape Law.

SELF-HELP

Self-Help is a special
kind of health care. Through
Self-Help women learn about
their bodies & their health
care needs. A group facilita-
tor provides information on
how your body functions, breast
self-exam and vaginal self-
exam (using a speculum). Life-
style issues and special health
concerns are discussed.

For more information, or to
join a Self-Help group, contact
