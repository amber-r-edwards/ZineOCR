"GENDER GAP" POLL RESULTS

A recent Los Angeles Times national  
opinion poll has attempted to examine  
the causes of the so-called "gender  
gap" which has shown up in polls as a  
lower level of support for Reagan and  
his policies among women than among  
men.

It could be felt, from these re-  
sults, that there is an increased  
level of political consciousness  
among women, and that the most impor-  
tant agenda items in the opinion  
of the women in this country are  
achieving prosperity at home and  
peace abroad. This policy gender  
gap did not seem to come about from  
many areas which are considered tra-  
ditional feminist concerns, such as  
abortion rights and support for the  
E.R.A., according to this poll. As  
a matter of fact, support for these  
issues was stronger among men than  
among women.

51% of the men favored allowing  
women to have an abortion, but only  
47% of the women. When asked if they  
favored the addition of the Equal  
Rights Amendment to the Constitution,  
70% of the men said yes, as opposed  
to 60% of the women.

When women polled were asked if  
feminist organizations such as the  
National Organization for Women and  
the National Women's Political Caucus  
speak for a majority of women in the  
United States, only 28% said yes,  
while 56% said these groups represent  
a small minority.

ARMY JOBS FOR WOMEN

October 21, the army re-opened 13  
of 23 career positions it had earlier  
closed to women to reduce "the prob-  
ability of their being engaged rou-  
tinely in direct combat" while keeping  
all direct combat jobs male-only.

This partial reversal was due to  
the efforts of the Defense Advisory  
Committee on Women in the Services.  
302 of 351 career fields will be open  
to women in 5,100 of 10,000 units.  
This decision affects 1,660 women,  

540 of whom are specialists in nuclear  
biological and chemical warfare.

More recruitment will also be  
allowed beyond the target of 70,000  
by 1987. Currently 10% of the army  
is female, and about 66,300 enlisted  
women are on active duty.

SPANISH PRO CHOICE BILL

The socialist majority of the  
Spanish Parliament voted to legalize  
abortion in that country for the first  
time in fifty years. The bill would  
permit abortion if the mother's life  
was in danger, the fetus was mal-  
formed, or if the pregnancy was a  
result of rape or incest.

The bill has already been chal-  
lenged by the conservative Constitu-  
tional Tribunal, which contends that  
the legislation violates an article  
of the national constitution, which  
says that all citizens have the  
right to life and moral integrity.

N.O.W. CRITICIZES BUSH

Judy Goldsmith, president of the  
National Organization for Women, has  
called Vice President Bush to task  
for saying that it was "a little de-  
grading" for Democratic presidential  
candidates to promise to consider  
women as running mates in the 1984  
election.

Ms. Goldsmith said that the comment  
was consistent with "a view that we've  
heard over and over again from the  
Reagan administration--that women  
don't have to be taken seriously!"

Six Democratic hopefuls Walter  
Mondale, John Glenn, Gary Hart,  

Ernest Hollings, Alan Cranston and  
George McGovern, all said they would  
consider a woman as a running mate.

ANOTHER CANDIDATE

...according to a UPI story, a 69  
year old Black woman, Isabell Masters,  
Ph.D. has announced her candidacy for  
president. She said she felt she had  
a good chance of winning because of  
her personality and because she is  
black.
