CUOMO FAVORS NEW YORK  
STATE E.R.A.

Governor Mario Cuomo of New York  
State is looking for approval of a  
state Equal Rights Amendment. If  
the E.R.A. wins approval by the  
State Senate and Assembly this year  
and in 1985, it could go to voters  
on the '85 ballot, when city elec-  
tions are being held around the  
state.

The E.R.A. lost in New York State  
by 40,000 votes in 1975. The amend-  
ment reads: "Equality of rights,  
under the law shall not be denied or  
abridged by the State of New  
York or any subdivision thereof on  
account of sex."

Anti-E.R.A. and anti-abortion  
groups oppose the state amendment.  
They are trying to amend the amend-  
ment so that it doesn't apply to  
"abortion funding, homosexuality,  
the military, marriage, private  
schools, churches or personal modes-  
ty."

Theresa Bergen, president of the  
state chapter of the National Organi-  
zation for Women, said that these  
“amendments will make the E.R.A.  
‘meaningless.'"

One conflict among feminists is  
the choice between a state E.R.A. and  
a clean amendment to the U.S. Constitution.

Both will take energy and time for  
campaigning. A state E.R.A. could  
solve some problems like discrimina-  
tory insurance rates, salaries and  
treatment in education. The state  
E.R.A. could also ensure fairer  
treatment in divorce settlements.  
Gloria Steinem says she opposes  
the state E.R.A. unless Cuomo is  
willing to spend money promoting it.  
She thinks it would be difficult to  
pass it through a state referendum,  
referring to its previous failure.

CHILDREN OF SILKWOOD  
WIN SUIT IN SUPREME COURT

The Supreme Court re-instated a  
10.5 million dollar award won by the  
children of Karen Silkwood, a union  
activist who died while working for  
Kerr-McGee, a manufacturer of plu-  
tonium.

In 1974, Silkwood died on her  
way to meet a newspaper reporter.  
She was allegedly going to discuss  
violations of federal laws and  
falsification of records at Kerr-  
McGee, when her car went off the  
road. She had also been radio-  
actively contaminated.

The justices reversed a lower  
court ruling that had thrown out  
an Oklahoma jury's award to Silk-  
wood's children as impermissible  
conflict with federal regulation  
of the nuclear industry. The  
reversal, however, will allow Kerr-  
McGee to challenge the 10.5 million  
dollar suit in the lower court.

PLANNED SERVICES FOR  
DISABLED UNVEILED

According to a Buffalo News  
article by Tom Buckham, the new  
four-year program (1984-88) proposed  
by the New York State Office of  
Mental Retardation and Developmental  
Disabilities met with mixed reviews  
when presented to the Western New  
York Social Service community at the  
end of December 1983.

Among the proposals is to reduce  
developmental center population from  
11,000 to 9,509 in the next four  
years, a cause for concern consider-  
ing the large percentage of the  
estimated 500,000 to 2 million  
(nationwide) homeless people who have  
previously deinstitutionalized.

Many of these people were not given  
enough community service support  
when they were released. Judy  
O'Rourke from West Seneca Developmen-  
tal Center said that "Community  
residences are fine for those who  
really belong in the community,  
and who are not just being forced  
there by some grand philosophical  
plan."

"Family Support" services were  
suggested for the 85% of disabled  
people who live at home, in addition  
to a plea for funding residences for  
those who cannot be served at home  
because their disabilities are too  
much of a burden for the family,  
but who can live fairly independently.

NEW RULINGS ON  
"BABY DOE" CASES

The Reagan administration has re-  
leased regulations that have been es-  
tablished to deal with cases like  
"Baby Doe." The new rules which will  
become operative in February, specify  
that care for disabled newborns must  
be based on 'reasonable' medical judg-  
ment and that treatment should "not  
be denied on the basis of an infant's  
present or anticipated mental or  
physical impairment," said Surgeon  
General C. Everett Koop.

Hospitals will be asked to create  
a board of experts to recommend gen-  
eral treatment for severely disabled  
infants and to offer advice when  
doctors and parents are considering  
withholding treatment. Institutions  
will be required to post notices that  
carry a hotline number to be used if  
it is suspected an infant is re-  
ceiving inadequate care. The posters,  
that will be where only doctors and  
nurses can see them, will state that  
in suspected neglect cases a health  
care worker should consult the home  
hospital review board before calling  
the number.

Another facet of the new rules  
will require state child protection  
agencies to develop procedures to  
"protect" handicapped infants from  
medical neglect. On the other hand,  
hospitals are not required to perform  
‘futile treatment or measures that  
merely prolong the act of dying.'

SUSAN KING TO SPEAK  
AT YWCA CELEBRATION

Susan King, NBC network correspon-  
dent, and the first female anchor on  
Western New York television, returns  
to Buffalo Saturday, February 25, to  
speak at the 125th birthday celebration  
of the YWCA of Buffalo and Erie County.

Ms. King will use anecdotes and  
observations taken from her own ex-  
periences as a "pioneer" to explore  
the status of women in the USA and  
abroad.

Ms. King joined WDVM in Washington  
D.C. in 1975, where she anchored the  
weekend news and served as the sta-  
tion's major political reporter. She  
had anchored the WGR-TV 2 “Newscenter  
2" news in Buffalo, but left for  
Washington when a local survey indi-  
cated that the WNY market “wasn't  
ready for a female anchor." In 1977,  
she moved to the ABC network, and  
covered major political stories,  
including the 1980 Democratic and  
Republican National Conventions,  
Candidate George Bush and the  
President-Elect Reagan. She served  
as ABC White House correspondent  
until October 1981.

At present, Ms. King is the pro-  
ducer and moderator of COVER STORY,  
an in-depth exploration of headline  
stories daily on WROC-TV (NBC).

She recently returned from a special  
assignment in Beirut, Lebanon.

With the theme, "125 years,  
Still Pioneering," the YWCA is  
marking its 114th year in Buffalo and  
125 years nationally at the event,  
their 114th annual meeting. It will  
be in the Marine Midland 38th Floor  
Restaurant. The public is invited  
to participate; tickets are $8.50,  
which includes luncheon (12:30 P.M.),  
and can be reserved by calling the  
YWCA at 852-6120.

12 YEAR OLD GIRL  
REFUSES TO TESTIFY

A California judge dismissed a  
child-molestation case for insuf-  
ficient evidence because a 12-year  
old girl would not testify against  
her step-father. The child, known  
only as Amy, because of her age,  
feared that her testimony would  
cause the break-up of her family.

The girl will be appearing in  
court so that the judge can decide  
to send her home, or back to her  
grandparents, who had been caring  
for her since the charges were made.

FOAT FILES FIVE MILLION  
DOLLAR LAWSUIT

Ginny Foat, member of the national  
board of N.O.W., recently acquitted  
of a 1963 murder trial, has filed a  
5 million dollar lawsuit against the  
woman who started the inquiry into  
her past.

Shelly Mandell and 25 others are  
named in the suit, and charged by  
Ms. Foat with "intentional emotional  
distress and civil conspiracy."
