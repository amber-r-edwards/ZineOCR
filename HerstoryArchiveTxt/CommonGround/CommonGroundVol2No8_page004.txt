Carol Reichert in Buffalo

by Gerri Bayer

Carol Reichert, N.Y.S. National  
Organization for Women Political  
Action Chair, spoke on "Women and  
Political Process" as part of a poli-  
tical skills training workshop spon-  
sored by N.O.W. Buffalo Chapter as  
part of the Feminists for Mondale  
effort.

Reichert addressed the group of  
politically involved women on Satur-  
day, March 17 at Laborers’ Local 210  
Union Hall on Franklin Street. She  
opened her talk by saying “Any woman  
who lives in this society already has  
the skills that translate into the  
political process."

She said that any woman who can  
drive, keep a budget, write a letter,  
ask for money, talk in front of people,  
do scheduling, or negotiate about  
anything has political skills train-  
ing. “Women are born negotiators,"  
she said. “We have survived for thou-  
sands of years by learning non-verbal  
cues, and we learn to negotiate by  
learning to nurture."

On the topic of political parties,  
she quoted Ellie Smeal, saying, "Women  
weren't born Democrats, Republicans  
or yesterday." She said that it is  
implicit in party structures to use  
people, and that using people isn't  
necessarily bad if it goes both ways.  
“Invest your time like you would your  
money. Make it pay high returns; get  
good interest."

Group action is most effective for  
women, Reichert said. “Smaller is  
better; cadres and chapters of women's  
groups can accumulate great debts by  
working within the party structure.“

Because women have been recognized  
as a political power, it is time to  
take some of that power and make it  
work. “Have confidence and volunteer  
for the job that will get recognition.  
Don't take just any kind of work—

stuffing envelopes doesn't garner  
enough debt."

“Volunteer your group to do a  
task from beginning to end"--walk  
an election district, do literature  
drops, work a phone bank as a group.  
“That is the kind of action that makes  
party people take notice.“ She also  
said that guilt cannot be channeled  
into effective political action and  
to do only those things that you are  
comfortable with.

One key to political effectiveness  
is having clearly defined group and  
individual goals. “The Gender Gap  
has given us a tool to make politi-  
cians responsive to our issues," she  
said. If you want the Equal Rights  
Amendment, actively support the can-  
didate that supports the ERA.

Energy is another part of politi-  
cal effectiveness. “Being in touch  
with emotions is a good way to get  
energy," Reichert says. The anger,  
frustration and fear of many women's  
lives can be mobilized to political  
action.

Lobbying on an issue can be ener-  
gizing, she said. "Go out and meet  
your legislators. When you know who  
they are, you'll know what's wrong  
and how to fix it."

On the subject of this year's pres-  
idential election, Reichert said  
“Ronald Reagan can be defeated by a  
large voting pool...if you have no  
interest in getting out the vote,  
register five feminists to vote."

“The political works best when  
there are more and more of us. The  
ballot box is the best way to let  
politicians know what we, as women,  
think.”

She ended by saying "When you  
look for a candidate that will repre-  
sent your interests; when you need  
a good feminist candidate, look in  
the mirror."

FEMINISTS CHALLENGE DEMOCRATS IN 1984

Another key issue that has placed  
many women squarely in the anti-Reagan  
camp is reproductive rights. The  
majority of women have little patience  
with a president who cut children's  
aid, nutrition, health and education  
programs, showing little concern for  
the living, while insisting on the  
sanctity of the unborn. The major-  
ity of the population - and the Su-  
preme Court - believes that a woman  
has a right to control her own body;  
and that includes the right to pre-  
vent having children as well as abor-  
tion as a last resort. Sex education,  
counseling, birth control and the  
availability of affordable abortions  
for poor women have all faced attacks  
by Reagan in the form of budget  
assaults on Family Planning Services  
and his support of a so-called “Human  
Life Amendment" which, if taken at  
face value, would criminalize the fe-  
male half of the population for using  
birth control pills or the loop!  
Feminists believe this level of  
governmental interference in the  
personal matter of reproductive  
choice is intolerable, noting that  
if women are forced to bear children  
against their will, the precedent  
would be established for the govern-  
ment to determine who should have  
children, when, and how many. Pro-  
choice supporters believe the right  
to make these decisions must be  
guaranteed by the government and  
the choice determined by each indi-  
vidual on the basis of personal--  
not legislated morality! In 1984,  
feminists are rightfully concerned  
that a second Reagan Administration  
could lead to new Supreme Court  
appointments that would cancel our  
right to control our own bodies and  
lives.

Feminist issues may well be the  
issue of the Democratic Party in  
1984. Equal rights, equal and com-  
parable pay; Affirmative Action,  
Reproductive Rights, a belief that  
the poor should not be abandoned  
but helped through support, educa-  
tion and job training. Convictions  
that our children are our future, and  
that they deserve proper nutrition,  
health care and education. Insis-  
tence that the elderly (the majority  
of whom are women) should not be  
deprived of their benefits and the  
right to survive. Rejection of a  
ballooning military budget that  
penalizes us domestically and in-  
volves us in dubious international  
confrontations. A belief that  
sexual orientation and family plan-  
ning decisions are private matters  
that should be guaranteed by law  
but not interfered with by govern-  
ment. A push for a flexible work  
schedule, daycare, equal pension  

allotments and insurance rates. A  

desire for strong Federal Agency  
appointments whose intent it is to  
improve--not dismantle--services.

An American faith that the United  
States has the capacity to provide  
meaningful work for the unemployed,  
and that unemployment is not the road  
to economic recovery!

In 1984, feminists still do not  
doubt they are equal. But in the  
face of a Reagan Administration  
that threatens women on all levels,  
the gender gap has broadened to a  
chasm. The new motto is “Remember  
in November" and this theme has re-  
sulted in the birth of new PACs,  
training seminars and political di-  
rection for feminist activists.

For the first time, the National  
Organization for Women endorsed a  
presidential candidate prior to the  
primary and urged women to run as  
delegates for Walter Mondale based  
on his feminist track record and  
his willingness to consider a woman  
vice-president. This year feminists  
are looking to the Democratic Party  
for Presidential leadership, offering  
their help to defeat a shared enemy!  
However, as statisticians take note  

COMMENTARY...

WOMEN  
ON TRIAL

by Gerri Bayer

Leslie Ann Emick, 23, has been  
convicted and sentenced for second  
degree manslaughter in the killing  
of her husband. She said that she  
was defending herself against a man  
who had brutally beaten her, raped  
her, psychologically and physically  
tortured her.

In New Bedford, Massachusetts,  
four men were convicted of rape.  

They said she asked for it. She said  
that she had been put on a pool table,  
raped by six men while the crowd  
cheered them on. The guilty verdict  
stirred up a disturbance and charges  
of racism from the community.

In medieval witch trials, women  
accused of witchcraft were given the  
water test. They were weighted down  
and thrown in the water. If they  
sank, they were innocent. They also  
often drowned. If they floated, they  
were guilty and died by torture and  
fire.

“Your honor, I'd like an order of  
protection." A young woman stands in  
a Family Court Chamber, asking for  
help against the man who left her with  
a black eye, bloodied hips and a gap  
where her tooth had been. The judge  
asks, “What did you do to provoke him  
into that?"

Violence against women in all its  
myriad forms, is criminal action that  
often goes unpunished. More often  
than not, it is the victim that is  
tried by the community, rather than  
the victimizer.

Leslie Ann Emick said that she  
shot Marshall Allison and that she  
killed him because he had threatened  
to kill her, her children and himself.  
She said she killed him when he was  
sleeping because she was afraid of  
his normal violence when he was awake.

Leslie was not tried for murdering  
him; she was tried for not leaving  
him. A rape victim has to prove her  
own innocence, purity and lack of  
participation before a rapist can be  
proven guilty. Women accused of  
witchcraft in both colonial America  
and medieval Europe were tortured  
into "confessing" impossibilities.

Why is rape such a hard conviction  
to get? Why do battered women who  
use the self-defense plea get sen-  
tenced? Why is rape one of the few  
crimes that require a witness to get  
a conviction? Why are men so afraid  
when women fight back, either legally  
or physically?

The phrase “rule of thumb" came  
from a law that said that it was legal  
for a man to beat his wife if the  
stick he used was no thicker than  
his thumb. The Bible advised that an  
unfaithful wife should be stoned to  
death. Battered women in this day  
and age are told by police that "it  
is only a family dispute, lady."

that the women's vote exceeds that  
of men, feminists emphasize they  
are not signing a contract with any  
political party; but rather, they  
are offering a challenge to the  
Democrats to speak to their issues,  
because women are now speaking for  
themselves.

There is, historically, a lack of  
censure for the crimes that men com-  
mit against women. A man could go  
free if he murdered his wife after  
she "nagged" him. Some laws have  
changed, but they are not enforced  
effectively enough to frighten anyone.

Men don't realize that it is not  
legal to rape, batter or assault women.  
A man who wouldn't cheat on his in-  
come tax feels free to beat up his  
wife. This is because there are  
stiff penalties for tax-evasion. The  
maximum that Erie County Family Court  
can assign a batterer is six months  
imprisonment -

A conviction in a rape trial hap-  
pens in one of ten reported cases and  
F.B.I. statistics show that only one  
in ten cases are reported.

Women who become outraged at vio-  
lence against women are often viewed  
as "radical crazies". Women who feel  
that pornography that depicts violence  
against women should carry tougher  
penalties are told that they want to  
restrict fifth amendment rights.  
These attitudes come from old ideas  
firmly rooted in our culture.

When a woman's only purpose is to  
make children, she becomes disposable.  
There will always be more women to  
bear more babies, and if a man doesn't  
like the woman he's got, he has two  
options. One is to exhaust her to  
death with child-bearing. The other  
is to abuse her so badly that she  
either leaves or dies. He could  
leave her, but why bother? She is  
his property.

If women are perceived to be the  
property of men, and men are legally  
encouraged to do what they please with  
what they own, then violence against  
women becomes inevitable. He knows  
that if his car doesn't work right,  
he can kick it. If his wife doesn't  
do what he bids, he can kick her, too.

The myth of who "nice girls" are  
has both men and women by the throats.  
Criticized heavily is the woman who's  
had too much to drink and loses her  
"inhibitions". Eyebrows are raised  
at the woman who has more than one  
sex partner at a time. A woman who  
is not “pure” is automatically a crim-  
inal for defying the "norms" set for  
us by society. Prostitutes have no  
legal rights in a rape case, because  
they are already guilty of the crime  
of impurity before they get to the  
courtroom.

The manslaughter trial in Alleghany  
County, New York and the rape case  
in New Bedford, Massachusetts, both  
in effect, tried the victims. Both  
victims were women who were found  
guilty for undefinable crimes.

Leslie may go to prison for stay-  
ing with the batterer. The rape vic-  
tim in New Bedford was found innocent  
of participating in her own violation,  
but received a sentence from society  
nonetheless when she was advised not  
to return to her home after the con-  
viction of the rapists. It is only  
when the crime is violence against  
women, is the answer to the question  
“was there a crime?" to be found in  
the behavior of the victim.

it was defunded) and is a member of  
the Leslie Ann Emick Defense Committee.
