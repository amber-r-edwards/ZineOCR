NOW ANNUAL AWARDS DINNER  

Peace Education for Women Project  

Some WAND members are beginning a new effort in peace education.  

We propose to  

provide a handbook which will include 12 peace activities for 12 monthly meetings  
and take it to clubs, church, neighborhood, union organizations - wherever women  

are already organized.  

This will be a good source of education for those who work  

on the project as well. Angeliki Keil is planning the project and will call you  
if you indicate your interest on the enclosed form.  

I would like to participate in these activities ( ). Please contact me with  

further information.
