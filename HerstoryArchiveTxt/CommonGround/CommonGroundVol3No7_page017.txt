To Be In Touch  

I'm not always  
happy with  
my body / myself  
Touch  
my rounded belly  
Wish for  
the shape  
I didn't want  
at sixteen  

I am not  
covergirl  
material —  
but I forget  
it can be  
fireworks  
material  
That my diamonds  
can sparkle  
without  
polish  

I shall cut  

from magazines  

my daughters will read  

all pictures of  
noxema-ed  
chanel-ed  

maidenformed  

women  

all photo-retouched  
bleached  
plastic-coated  
women  
who will make  
my daughters  
strain against  
their own  
imperfect / perfect  
bodies  

I will show them  
instead  
to sense  
spring beneath snow  
To read  
each others’  
and weigh  
only words  
To touch  
be touched  
to speak  
be heard  
To be  
in touch  

faces

Sundown  

My grandmother's hands  
tangle in her lap  

like the ruins of dreams.  
Each day she bends close,  
closer to the earth,  
drawn to the earth,  

drawn to its music.  

As the evening sun  

casts its warmth  

about her shoulders,  

her shadow stretches before her  
like a prophecy.

MARCH 1985  

Woman Express  

The Naming  

she came into the room  

as softly as the fog  

that swirls and floats  

and disappears without a trace,  
seeking one to know,  

be known by one  

asking something of her presence.  

no one seemed to know her face  
no one knew that she was there  
except the gray-haired stranger  
in the mirror.  

I am the same  

as yesterday, she said  
to no one listening.  
if you cannot see me  

I have lost myself.  

Dorothy Hanson Brown  

Tumbling  

You are light  
rolling off my tongue  
tumbling  

into a lovable heap  
of sensuous memories  

verse,  

which,  

when touched,  

arch  

into an animal  
gentle yet aggressive  
to my whims,  

and after frothing  
you so lightly  
touch  

my inner thighs  
sending me  

in between  

the lines of you.

“Beginnings,” by Doris A. Santercole  

Untitled  

The ages renew, repeat  
in your opal eyes,  

I stand alone, inked  

upon a mountaintop,  

as strong as your  

willow whispers  

of contentment  

in the late, liquid nights,  
by barred windows  

in the Bronx.  

Dawn corrupts,  

street fights, bodies, steam pipes,  
flesh pours,  

I expect your dissolution  
on the sheets  

of my promise.

Visit to the Tomb of Lenin  

Once through that wretched wall  
barbed wire and cropped field fly;  
with Poland at my back we meet.  
Bare-legged, you lead the way  

past scarlet stars  

and gold-wrapped domes  

to dead hands on black velvet.  

We speak of men and wars,  

Spanish churches, abortion (yours).  
Oh, when did the alchemy begin—  
your face become so dear,  

my friend?  

Plastic pennants gaily wave  
greetings from the service stations  
of America...and yet, today  

I still can see red gladiolas,  

a gas-lit flame,  

and more:  

I cry, speaking your name.
