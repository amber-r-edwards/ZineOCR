HELP COMMON GROUND  

Save Those Tapes!  

REMINDER:  

Here's a simple way that you can  
help Common Ground: save your cash  
register tapes from Tops, Bells, and  
Super Duper.  
Common Ground, as a non-profit organization, receives money.  

Simply save your tapes and mail  
them to us, give them to a collective  
member, or deposit them in our box  
at EMMA bookstore. If you wish to  
use any coupons on the backs of receipts, just give us the bottom portion, showing the total amount.  

Our task of sorting and adding up  
the receipts is greatly simplified  
if you sort your tapes by store and  
then paper clip each type of store together.  

HINT: SEND TAPES WHEN YOU HAVE A  
LARGE NUMBER SAVED!
