ANYONE WHO THINKS EQUAL RIGHTS FOR  
WOMEN, THE WOMEN'S MOVEMENT OR THE  
NETWORKS, COALITIONS, AND GAINS WOMEN  
HAVE MADE SINCE THE 1950s HAVE BEEN  
SWEPT AWAY WITH THE DEFEAT OF THE  
E.R.A., NEED ONLY LOOK AT WESTERN  
NEW YORK'S COALITION FOR EQUAL  
RIGHTS (formerly the Beyond E.R.A.  
Coalition.)  

Formed locally by the Buffalo  
Branch of the American Association  
of University Women, the Coalition  
held a press conference and rally in  
Niagara Square July 1 to mark the  
new beginnings of the drive for  
equal rights.  

In May, the Buffalo A.A.U.W.  
received information and support from  
the National Women's Conference  
Committee, which is an outgrowth of  
the 1977 Houston Conference on Women,  
and began planning a press conference.  
They contacted the local affiliates  
of national members of the National  
Women's Conference Committee. By the  
time of the press conference and  
rally, 16 groups had joined the  
Coalition. Coalition membership is  
open to any individual, male or  
female, or any group or organization  
that, simply stated, believes in  
equal rights for everyone.  

They state: "The Coalition for  
Equal Rights is operating under the  
principle that the Federal E.R.A.  
would benefit both men and women.  

Men have sometimes felt excluded  

from the “women's movement." Therefore,  
the Coalition is making an  
effort to open up the struggle for  
equal rights to men."  

The Coalition's members include:  
The American Association of Univer-  
sity Women, Buffalo and East Aurora,  
Branches, Association of Women  
Attorneys, Buffalo Teacher's Feder-  
ation, Business and Professional  
Women Chapters in Western New York,  
EveryWoman Opportunity Center,  
League of Women Voters - all  
chapters in Buffalo and Erie County,  
National Council of Jewish Women,  
National Organization for Women -  
Buffalo and Suburban Branches,  
National Women's Political Caucus,  
Task Force for Victims of Domestic  
Violence, Women Lawyers of Western  
New York, Y.W.C.A. of Buffalo and  
Erie County, Zonta International,  
Hadassah, New York State American  
Civil Liberties Union, A.F.S.M.E.,  
plus a number of individuals who  
have made commitments to equal  
rights.  

This fall, the Coalition is  
focusing on the September primar-  
ies and November Election. They  
are conducting a survey of candi-  
dates, including those in the  
State Senate and Assembly, and  
asking candidates if they would  
support State and/or Federal  
E.R.A.s. (Results of this survey  
are printed below in this  
issue of Common Ground.)  

After the elections, they plan  
to concentrate on disseminating  
information, and identifying state  
laws which discriminate against  
women.  

The Coalition's plans also  
include moving into task-force  
areas (which are also coordinated  
with national efforts): Health,  
Employment, Education, Childcare,  
Homemaker/Family Law, Elective  
Office, and International  
Issues.  

Other specific plans include a  

letter writing campaign to keep  
Title IX, (one section of the  
Elementary and Secondary Education  
Act having to do with parity funding  
for girls and boys), in place.  

In a telephone interview with  
Pat Seaver, one of the coordinators  
of the Coalition, Ms. Seaver stressed  
that she felt women had learned a lot,  
especially about effective politics,  
from the E.R.A. struggle and from the  
progress of women into the political  
mainstream.  

She said: "In the Coalition, we  
are really going to work a lot on  
public relations as well as education  
of public officials. The research  
we are doing into individual laws  

and situations which discriminate  
against women is going to be very  

important.  

“For instance, under the Equal Pay  
Opportunity Act, a woman cannot go  
directly to the courts if she feels  
she is being discriminated against in  
her paycheck," said Ms. Seaver. She  
continued, "She must go to the  
E.E.O.C. (Equal Employment Opportunity  
Commission) and file a complaint.  
They are so tremendously  
understaffed that it is not unusual  
for a case to be pending ten years  
before it comes up for a hearing.  

"We want to find both laws and  
the ways in which laws are en-  
forced which discriminate against  
women. When the federal E.R.A.  

comes up for a vote, we want to be  
able to have that information at our  
fingertips and to be able to quote  
chapter and verse.  

People want to prove it. We want to be able  
to back up our assertions with  
accurate research."

COMMON GROUND  

Poli-supplied by Coalition for Equal Rights  

I would be willing to sponsor legislation that would  
ensure passage of an ERA amendment (sic) to the Constitution and  
would most assuredly speak in its favor whenever and wherever possible.  

I will introduce a bill, will push the bill, and do  
all I can to ensure passage of this bill, in the New York State Senate,--  

Support Re-drafting of ERA Legislation  
Enact a grassroots--effective statewide effort that has political savvy. Greater  
emphasis placed on the positive reasons why ERA is needed: 1.  
Inbalance, 2. Equal pay for Comparable Work 3.  

Wage More Women in  

I would be willing to co-sponsor a bill for a new  
state referendum, inform the public as to the need for ERA, and  
provide support to pro-ERA groups through whatever means possible.  

I was a member of the New York State Legislature when  
it gave second passage to the proposal to add an equal rights amendment  
to the New York State Constitution,  
Legislature and then actively campaigned on its behalf.  
It was defeated in a referendum in November of 1975.  
I would be willing to co-sponsor, speak on behalf of, and vote for both a  
state and a federal equal rights amendment.  

Whatever I can to get it passed.  

Timothy Lovallo: Through co-sponsorship and active lobbying for state  
ratification, I will push for quick endorsement of the federal ERA.  
Concurrently, I will co-sponsor and seek passage of the Equal Rights  
Amendment for incorporation with the New York State Constitution.  

I voted for this amendment in the  
Unfortunately, it  
I would, of course,  

I will urge every assemblyman and senator serving  
to support the passage of the amendment.  
I will serve on any future steering committees which may be formed to lobby  

In addition, I will  

Nowhere in our free enterprise system has such an  
important resource as individual ability been so mismanaged as  
With 30 years management engineering experience,  
I can attest to the need for selecting the best person regardless of  

In lieu of the questionnaire, Mr. Sheffer sent a letter,  
saying that he finds "such questionnaires to be extremely counter-  

I frankly believe that prior signed commitments on any  
individual bill is extremely poor policy and I have found such signed  
papers to be misused in the past.  
It is not prudent for a legislator to effectively cut off the opportunity to entertain  
constituent opinions on any issue.  
My hope is that the Coalition will join in an enlightened discussion and debate on the  
ERA over the next months prior to a vote in the Legislature.
