Women Helping Women

Honored for their hard work and  
willingness to help other women, Dr.  
Liz Kennedy, Ms. Norine Spurling and  
the Niagara Frontier Chapter for  
Psychoprophylaxis in Obstetrics, ac-  
cepted the 1982 "Women Helping Wo-  
men" awards given by the Buffalo  
Chapter of the National Organization  
for Women at a pot-luck dinner Decem-  
ber 15.

This award was instituted in  
1979 to recognize and highlight  
work that women undertake, which di-  
rectly affects and improves the lives  
of other community women.

Women are seldom congratulated in  
or get attention from the media for  
the long term, low-profile (often  
volunteer) work which is the founda-  
tion of real change. The "Women  
Helping Women" awards bring well-  
deserved recognition to those who  
we women need to thank and to those  
who can serve as role models for oth-  
ers.

Presenting the awards was Ms. Jo  
Alfano, current president of the  
Buffalo chapter of NOW, who was her-  
self recognized that evening for her  
work with NOW since 1977. Ms. Al-  
fano spoke with pride of the accom-  
plishments of the recipients, who  
attended the awards dinner with  
sixty or more community women.

Dr. Kennedy, who supervises the  
Women's Studies Program at the Uni-  
versity of Buffalo, started the  
program in 1971 with one course --  
“Women in Contemporary Society".  
Women's Studies at UB now includes  
more than 20 courses and could soon  

offer a degree program. Kennedy  
said she thought younger women took  
things like women's studies for  
granted, and must learn to realize  
the struggle to maintain these pro-  
grams is as crucial now as in the  
70's. Kennedy was honored for her  
dedication to keeping women's stud-  
ies healthy and accessible, and for  
her life as a feminist-activist,  
scholar and educator.

Ms. Norine Spurling was honored  
for her work as an artist and gal-  
lery director. She is director of  
the Artists' Committee Gallery,  
past-director of Womenworks Gallery,  
and founding member of Western New  
York Women's Art Registry. She was  
specifically cited for organizing an  
exhibit in which artists also brought  
works of family members, making in  
some cases an intergenerational art  
show. She has often been the only  
one among the male-dominated art  
administrators and gallery operators  
to bring an alternative "women's"  
perspective to the decision-making  
about who or what is shown.

Elena Kehoe, a member of the  
Buffalo Women's Health Network,  
presented ASPO with their award.

Ms. Marianne Potter, a member of  
ASPO, accepted it on their behalf.  
This health group, better known as  
the “Lamaze" proponents, has been  
educating women and their families  
about the childbirth experience for  
25 years. They were cited as being  
responsible for allowing women to  
take control of their bodies and  
the birth experience, allowing  
fathers to be present during child-  
birth and allowing unmedicated  
births, all of which make birth  
alternatives easier. Ms. Potter,  
in accepting the award, said of  
her volunteer organization, that  
they have helped women realize  
their bodies are their own, and  
that we have a right to participate  
actively in childbirth, rather than  
be passive observers.

Women at the pot-luck seemed to  
agree with what one participant  
said: "I hope we keep working and  
do a lot more, because we're no-  
where near equality." In recog-  
nizing women's achievements, we  
encourage others to work for the  
benefit of all women.

DEPO-PROVERA

A Food and Drug Administration  
panel will be making recommendations  
to FDA Commissioner Arthur Hayes, on  
the advisability of marketing  
Depo-Provera, an injectable contra-  
ceptive, in this country. The  
panel heard testimony from Upjohn,  
the manufacturer, and opponents,  
such as the National Women's  
Health Network and Ralph Nader's  
Health Research Group on the  
safety and long-term side  
effects of the drug, as well as  
the controversy surrounding the  
testing and marketing of the drug.

Depo-Provera, a synthetic version  
of progesterone (a female hormone),  
disrupts the ovulation cycle in  
women. It can be injected  
four times a year, and can be  
100% effective in preventing  
conception/pregnancy. Because it  
does not contain estrogen, like  
the Pill does, it does not have  
some of the side effects associ-  
ated with the Pill and which are  
of most concern: abnormal blood  
clots and heart attack.

Upjohn's own tests, however, have  
caused concern for the risk of  
cancer. Also, the documented  
side effects include: weight gain,  
hair loss, loss of sex drive,  
birth defects, and menstrual  
irregularities, including com-  
plete cessation of menstrual bleed-  
ing and infertility. While these  
side effects are not life-threat-  
ening, advocates wonder if, in  
comparison with other forms of  
contraception, these side effects  
are worth it. The long-term cancer  
risks will not become evident for  
up to 20 years, advocates note.

Upjohn was also questioned on  
its marketing practices. The drug  
is used most often in Third World  
countries, where governments are  
trying to control population growth,  
and may not necessarily give com-  
plete and accurate information to  
the women receiving it, about the  
long-term risks. Because it is  
injectable and needs only quarterly  
re-administration, it makes popula-  
tion control easier and ensures that  
those who receive the drug use it.  
Great Britain has banned the use  
of Depo-Provera, and activists in  
Canada are trying to get Upjohn, who  
manufactures the drug there, to  
cease production.

BELVA LOCKWOOD STAMP

A proposed U.S. postal stamp  
honoring Niagara County native Belva  
Bennett Lockwood, has been put "on  
hold" by an advisory committee to  
the mail service. Lockwood's most  
noteworthy accomplishment was being  
the first woman to run for the  
presidency -- in 1884.

The U.S. Postal Service will be  
considering the stamp honoring  
Lockwood in meetings in March and  
May. A spokesperson said they are  
considering Lockwood for the "Great  
American" series of commemorative  
stamps.
