Racism and sexism are usually  
used synonymously, but I prefer  

to deal with them separately, be-  
cause while racism is a relatively  
new phenomenon, sexism, like the  
poor, we have always had with us.  
Both were transplanted to "Amer-  
ikka" by European Christian colo-  
nists. Although there were certain  
divisions of labor and roles between  
the sexes, North American women held  
more or less equal status with men.  
Sexism and racism were introduced  
from Europe along with capitalism.  

Sexual oppression was wide-  
spread in all ancient European,  
Asian and some African nations  
in the pre-Judeo-Christian era;  
however, it took Judeo-Christ-  
ianity to put the stamp of div-  
ine ordination on sexism by  
claiming (contrary to the law  
of biology) that man had given  
birth to woman, as detailed in  
Genesis. Prior to capitalism,  

the subordination of women was  
based upon religious concepts.  
To go one conceptual step further,  
the premise upon which Western Chris-  
tianity's doctrine of female  
subjugation is based is "God  
gave birth to man and man gave  
birth to woman." The obvious  
conclusion of such a dogma is,  
therefore, as God is over man,  
man is over woman. Does it then  
follow that man answers to God  
and woman answers to man? To  
quote the New Testament, "as  
Christ is head of the church,  
the husband is head of the wife."  

There is also that sinister pro-  
clamation at the conclusion  
of a wedding ceremony: "I now  
pronounce you man and wife!"  
Here, woman is even robbed of her  
gender.  

In the struggle against sex-  
ism, we are challenged by  
formidable adversaries: exploita-  
tive capitalism and dogmatic  
fundamentalist religion. When  
the absolute triumph of the mer-  
cantile class, capitalism, over-  
threw feudalism, the legalistically-  
minded petite bourgeoisie  
invented “scientific" explanations  
for the subjugation of women:  
Women were weaker than men (muscle tone).  
Women had less intellectual ability than  
men (keep them ignorant). They  
were periodically incapacitated  
by their biology (keep them preg-  
nant). Not only did this pseudo-  
science support the case for fem-  
ale subjugation, but no less an  
authority than the Bible "proved"  
the divine origins of female  
inherent inferiority. In all the  
major religions of the world,  
particularly Islam, Judaism, and  
Christianity, the inferiority  
and subjugation of women is the  
very essence of the dogma. This  
means the eradication of sexism  
will entail not only struggle  
against the sexist economic  
system, but also an intense  
struggle with entrenched religious  
dogmas.  

Another equally important as-  
pect of sexism which is extremely  
different from racism must be  

understood and dealt with. His-  
torically, all racially and nat-  
ionally oppressed people have not  
struggled and fought against in-  
ferior status—the very idea that  
their race or nation was inferior  
was totally rejected by them.  
Women, on the other hand, have  
historically accepted inferior  
status, not only in the church,  
but in secular society as well.  
Women, with rare exceptions, have  
believed in their own inferiority.  

The fight against sexism will  
be three-pronged: socio-economic,  
religious, and consciousness level  
raising among working-class women.  
Consciousness level raising must  
be an effort similar in propor-  
tions to the P.U.S.H. “We are  
somebody" program which was very  
effective in raising the con-  
sciousness level of blacks. How  
women perceive themselves at the  
present time is far more import-  
ant than how the male-dominated  
institutions of society perceive  
women.  

Consciousness level raising is  
the key to organizing on women's  
issues. Without being aware of  
the source of their oppression,  
women cannot be made aware of  
ways to struggle against sexist  
oppression. Women must be taught  
the political economy of sex  
for the oppression of women is  
most assuredly economic in nature.  

"Women's work" has been  
productive of surplus value.  
If a woman is not directly employed by  
capital in creating commodities  
or services necessary to com-  
modity production, a woman is  
said to be unemployed or sup-  
ported by her husband. In other  
words, if she is raising "his"  
children, maintaining a house-  
hold, preparing meals, doing  
laundry, this is considered non-  
work, when in reality it is non-  
paid work! Between the two there  
is a monumental difference. With-  
out this so-called "non-work"  
performed by women, the capital-  
ist system could not function.  
Most feminists, I am sure, are  
familiar with the theory of value  
appropriated by the economic sys-  
tem from women's unpaid labor.  
Especially, women function as  
socializers of the next gener-  
ation so that they will accept  
the class structure of capital-  
ism. Also, the domestic tasks  
performed by women maintain the  
workforce in a ready-and-able-to-  
produce condition. Next, (which  
I intend to explore in future  
articles), women's unpaid labor  
as "self-service shoppers" is  

one more contribution. Last, but  
certainly not least, women tra-  
ditionally occupy the lower rung  
in the patriarchal pecking or-  
der of the power structure. Man-  
agers kick foremen, foremen kick  
the laborers, and the laborers  
kick their wives! This is, of  
course, an oversimplification  

for clarity only!  

The special function of the  
black working-class woman is to  
occupy the absolute pit of the  
pecking order. The low economic  
status of black women has a two-  
fold purpose. First and fore-  
most, it is profitable; super-  
exploitation of black women  
creates vast surplus value.  
Secondly, it serves to divide  
working-class women by giving  
white women a false illusion of  
superior caste, when actually  
the low wages of black women are  
a depressant on the wages and  
benefits of all women.  

The root cause of women's op-  
pression is therefore embedded in  
the economic structure of the cor-  
porate state. Sexism is of the  
definition of capitalism. Funda-  
mentalist religion supports the  
status quo of the economic system,  
just as capitalism uses racism to  
keep blacks and Hispanics in their  
"place at the bottom of the econ-  
omic order." Capitalism also uses  
fundamentalist religion (Catholic  

From a Laborer’s View:  
Root Causes of Sexism  

and Protestant) to keep women in  
their place at the bottom of the  
economic order. Make no mistake—  
it is the economic structure of  
the corporate state that manipulates  
the new electronic fundamentalism,  
and not the other way around.  

The division of labor in the  
church (synagogue/mosque) is the  
same as the division of labor in  
the corporate state. Men rule  
and control the wealth; women  
work and produce the wealth.  

Let me conclude by saying the  
founding ideologues of the cap-  
italist state were quite deceptive  
in their rhetoric about the rights  
of "men" (black, Native American  
and working-class men excluded in  
fact but not in word). No such de-  
ception was used in the subjugation  
of women. It was made clear that  
women were subordinate to men.  

And in summary, sexism did not  
originate with capitalism. It  
was born out of ancient slavery,  
continued under feudalism and  
has been given new and more fright-  
ening dimensions under capitalism.

Each year for these awards, we  
feel we have the best slate of women  
ever. 1985 produced as a winner  
Elizabeth Crocker, village, town,  
and (the first) county historian.  
She was presented the Anne Bernstein  
Communications Award for her five  
published books and many newspaper  
articles. She won't divulge her  
age (about 90, sources say), and  
was so busy organizing the state  
meeting of county historians, to  
be held soon in Fredonia, that we  
weren't sure she'd get to the party.  

The Elnora Babcock Working Home-  
maker Award went to Martha Schultz  
for 70 years (she admitted to being  
93) of confronting tradition. A  
chiropractor since the 1920s, she  
became a housekeeper during the  
Depression so the adults of that  
family could both work full-time.  
Her hard work and determination not  
to be limited were exemplified by  
her walk up to receive her award and  
gifts; she'd not walk again.  

At the other end of the age spec-  
trum was Sue Hollowell, winner of  
the Calista Jones award, who at 33  
has been for a year the youngest  
county political chair"man" in the  
state. First female chairperson  
of either party in Chautauqua County  
and a teacher at Dunkirk High School,  
she serves as a positive role model  
for her students.  

The Debbie Thomas Special Student  
Award was given to Barbara Van  
Rensselaer of Silver Creek, a psych-  
ology student nominated by several  
people. A single parent and active  
volunteer in several areas, she's  
this year's Festival of Grapes chair,  
in addition to working on an under-  
graduate paper for publication in  
the Social Psychology Journal.  

The Kate Peate Working Woman  
Award went to Mary McKenna, a nurse  
practitioner for the county Family

Planning Clinics. She's a member  
of the Clinic's advisory board,  
a weekend supervisor at Brooks Hos-  
pital, and works one day every week  
at Fredonia College in the Birth  
Control Information Clinic.  

In terms of the number of women  
suggested, the committee probably  
has the most difficulty with the  
Caroline Skinner Twing Community  
Service Award, which reflects on  
the number of woman-hours quietly  
devoted to improving the lives  
of others. For example, the list of  
projects carried out by Yvonne  
Wilensky, this year's awardee, in-  
cludes but is not limited to: Trea-  
surer of the Friends of Reed Library  
and of Temple Beth El in Dunkirk,  
co-chair of the United Way campaign  
at the College, recording secretary  
and publicity chair for the Zonta  
Club, organizer of the Reed Library  
collection on the subject of the  
Holocaust, and establisher of dis-  
plays on that subject at the library  
and at the Temple. Yvonne works to  
raise money for the Chautauqua Day  
Care Project and for the Hotline  
on Rape and Battering. She shops  
weekly for an ill neighbor and is  
instantly available to provide  
transportation to Buffalo for medi-  
cal emergencies.  

Obviously, we can only know as much  
about each of these women as the  
people who nominate them are  
privy to, or as they choose to tell  
us about themselves. Their lives  
would no doubt provide a wealth of  
material on struggle. The level of  
joy at the annual party comes from  
elation at having finally rewarded  

publicly individuals whose dedication  

and hard work over decades would  
otherwise be known only to a few.  

It is truly a celebration of women.  
I'm so proud of the winners (though  
I had no part in choosing them) and  
proud of the uncounted hours LWSC  
members dedicate to the ceremony  
honoring them.
