Women &  
Politics Cont...  

Cont. from Page 9  

We have been sufficiently burned  
in the past to be more astute in  
the future—barely had the applause  
died down for Sandra Day O'Connor  
when the realization hit that she  
votes with Rehnquist, reminding us  
that the question is what kind of  
woman, not whether or not the candi-  
date is female. We defeated the  
E.R.A. by not throwing the bums out  
that were against us, once it became  
clear that reason had its limits.  

We cannot afford to forget that  
Phyllis Schlafly is as much the pro-  
duct of women in politics as the  
National Women's Political Caucus is  
the result of women not in politics.  
These lessons learned, we can reach  
out to Everywoman, from Hadassah to  
C.A.R.A.S.A., to find the collective  
clout we need to direct our offen-  
sive at the heart of mainstream poli-  
tics. The E.R.A. effort honed women's  
skills in a national effort, and  
taught us that we could convince the  
majority of a country's voters, even  
if we did not get the brass ring.  
That same effort can be applied to  
state, county and local races where  
the voting base can be more easily  
analyzed, and where each vote is a  
measurable percentage. I always like  
to remember that J.F.K. won by an  
average of one vote per election  
district.

“I’ve personally always preferred Ms.  
Liberty...torch lifted by her strong right  
arm, a larger than life woman...”  

SM ROR HORE OSE  

Some years ago, after my initial  
discovery of the accessibility of  
politics, I realized that there  
were two basic tenets: there are  
rules to be learned, and, once  
learned, they are always changing. I  
also found that political skills are  
the application of life's skills, in  
a direction that is larger and more  
significant than any one individual  
in time. From this, I concluded that  
it is a far, far better thing to be  
a part of changing the rules than to  
be wondering what they might be.  
Personally, I've always preferred  
Ms. Liberty as an image to Uncle Sam,  
torch lifted by her strong right arm,  
illuminating a larger than life woman  
committed to the future and represent-  
ing the fulfillment of individual  
ideals. Not a bad image at all for  
today's political action, and tomor-  
row's political woman.

How to Get a Bill Through Congress  

by Patricia Horan, R.D.  
Legislative Chairperson, WNYDA  

INTRO:  

Did you ever wonder how a bill gets  
processed through the New York State  
Legislature? The N.Y. Dietetic Assoc-  
iation drafted and followed a licensure  
bill. Following is a description of  
that group's experience.  

Editor.  

In 1975, a poll of the members of  
the New York State Dietetic Association  
revealed that 69% of those who respond-  
ed to the questionnaire were in favor  
of state licensure for dietitians. It  
was felt that licensure of dietitians  
had many advantages both to the public  
and to the profession.  

The following year the Bulletin of  
the New York Dietetic Association re-  
ported on the advantages as well as  
the possible disadvantages of licen-  
sure. In 1977, workshops were held  
across the state on this topic.  

In 1977, a bill was drafted for  
the State Association by legal coun-  
sel and a position called "Licensure"  
was established in the State Dietetic  
Association House of Delegates.  

The Committee on Licensure prepared  
a document answering questions from the  
Senate Education Committee. This docu-  
ment supports the points which the  
State Dietetic Association feels make  
licensure desirable and necessary. The  
legislators had indicated that they  
must be assured that licensure is an  
advantage to the public and that it  
will not add a burden to the state  
bureaucracy. The document addressed  

these points of how the public is suf-  
fering because of lack of licensure. This documentation, which includes case studies and  
other information, was gathered over  
the years by the Licensure Committee.  
The Licensure Bill was then introduced  
into the New York Senate by Senator  
John Flynn on April 21, 1980.  

Letters of support from other health  
professionals (physicians, nurses, occ-  
upational therapists, social workers,  
etc.) were solicited and over 100 let-  
ters were submitted. Dietetic Associ-  
ation members were encouraged to est-  
ablish rapport with their state Sena-  
tors and Assemblymen, providing them  
with general information on who we are  
and what we do. Periodically, members  
have been asked to write to their legi-  
slators asking for support of the bill.  

On June 2, 1981, the Assembly High-  
er Education Committee voted to hold  
the bill because of technical problems.  
Technical Amendments were then drafted  
by legal counsel. The members of the  
Higher Education Committee were then  
sent Mailgrams, notifying them of the  
Amendments to the bill.  

Members have also been encouraged  
to financially support the Licensure  
Bill ($5.00 per member was suggested  
this year, with present membership  
at 3,566).  

On a local level, this  
Western New York Dietetic  
sent out a mailing to all  
encouraging them to write to their  
Assemblymen in support of the Licen-  
sure Bill. Copies of "Your Elected  
Officials", prepared by the League  
of Women Voters, were also available  
to members. The Licensure Bill was  
also discussed at the State Convention  
at the Buffalo Hilton in May, when  
copies of the Bill were distributed.  

A statewide telephone network was  
established this year in which the New  
York State Dietetic Association Licen-  

sure Committee Chairman, Jean Minskoff  
Sands, R.D., was able to make reports  
on the status of the bill to individ-  
uals from the various district Dietetic  
Associations and have this information  
disseminated throughout the state memb-  
ership.  

Although the New York State Dietetic  
Association has been working for licen-  
sure for over seven years, the progress  
of this bill has been rapid when com-  
pared to most pieces of legislation.  

Where to File  
Discrimination  
Complaints  

Where to File  
You should contact New York State  
Attorney General Robert Abrams’  
office of the Civil Rights Bureau (212-  
488-7511) when you believe you have  
suffered discrimination (in employ-  
ment, housing, credit, education or  
access to public accommodations) that  
is part of a larger pattern of dis-  
crimination against others. This can  
occur in two ways: when it affects  
many others in a widespread practice  
among various institutions/industries,  
or when it affects many people in one  
institution/industry. The local office  
is: 65 Court St. Buffalo, N.Y. 14202  
(847-7179)  

in employment affecting only the com-  
plainant or a few others, the most ap-  
propriate place to contact is the  
State Division of Human Rights (69  
Delaware Ave. Buffalo, N.Y 14202  
(842-4456)  

In similar employment cases,  
first contact the Federal Equal Em-  
ployment Opportunity Center (EEOC)  
at 1 W. Genesee St. Buffalo, N.Y.  
14202 (832-4441) In New York State,  
all complaints to the EEOC are auto-  
matically referred to the Division of  
Human Rights.  

For further information write  
for "Civil Rights in New York State"  
a guide and directory for New York  
State residents. It is available  
from the State of N.Y. Dept. of Law,  
Two World Trade Center, N.Y, N.Y.,  
10047.  

When to File  

Complaints to the Office of Human  
Rights must be filed within one year  
of the act of discrimination. De-  
pending on the nature of the complaint  
to the EEOC, a deadline of 180 days  
to two years applies.
