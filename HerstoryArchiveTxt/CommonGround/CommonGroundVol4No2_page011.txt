LEG -O- MUTTON FAEVER.

by Adeline Hinman

As we all know, back in the 1880s
divorce was scandalous stuff. Imagine
my surprise the other day when I
learned my Grandmother had been mar-
ried twice, her first marriage ending
in divorce. It seems Granma was
happily married to an enterprising
young lawyer when it was brought to
her attention by a "dear friend" that
some of his enterprising activity
took the form of adultery. Granma
was incensed. She sued for divorce,
which was granted, and thereupon
became acquainted with the real world.
In addition to being free she was
also dropped from the church rolls,
former friends no longer knew her -
including the informer - and she had
no means of support. What to do?
Being resourceful as well as up the
well-known creek she took stock of
her options and went into business,
reading palms for $.50 each.

Why palm reading? We must under-
stand the Victorian preoccupation
with death and dying. Typical pop-
ular songs were "The Letter Edged
in Black” and "In The Baggage Car
Ahead." Presumably reference in
the latter song was to a body being
shipped home for burial. Victorians
welcomed various forms of occultism
and off-beat religions. Ouija boards
were a favorite means of attempting
to contact the dear departed; “Madam
Blavatsky had homogenized eastern
and western religions into a blend
she called Theosophy, and rappings
the Fox sisters had recently heard

at their farmhouse near Rochester
occasioned the formation of the
Spiritualist Church. In such an
environment Granma's palm reading
prospered. Twin ripples on the
pond of her new life were the dim
view conventional religions took
of her unorthodox livelihood and
the charlatans who gave it a bad
name.

Eventually Granma remarried. My
grandfather was considerably older
than she and when Granma became
widowed it was only natural for her
to resume her former occupation,
only this time she had two children
to support. After both children
married, Granma was alone again.

She admired Thoreau greatly, and

as much as possible, lived accord-
ing to his principle of "Simplify,
simplify." Home was a small house
in Central New York State furnished
with scatter rugs and cotton cur-
tains. If she wanted to go berry-
ing there were nearby hills covered

WORKER BENEFITS

A NEW APPROACH TO OLD POLICIES:
TODAY'S WORKERS' BENEFITS

The work force of today differs
markedly from the one employers
dealt with in the recent past. The
CPA client Bulletin for September
1985, cited a Conference Board study
which found that:
*** more than 25 percent of all work-
ers are single;
*** over 40 percent of the work force
consists of working couples;
*** less than 12 million married men
provide the sole support for their
families;
*** less than 60 percent of households
are composed of married couples (down
20 percent from the post WWII era);
*** 60 percent of all mothers hold jobs.

Gone are the days when the "typical
employee" was a married male with a
wife who did not work outside the
home.

These changes in the complexion of
the workforce have fostered changes
in employment policies and practices,
especially among larger companies.
One of the major shifts is toward a
program which allows employees to
select their own preferred benefits,
within a specific perimeter.

These cafeteria benefit plans do
not lead to, as the Treasury Depart-
ment and many others believed, a
preference for benefits which won't
cost the worker anything in taxes.
The Employers' Council on Flexible
Compensation states that, according
to their studies, employees simply
chose the benefits they preferred,
paying little or no attention to
the tax consequences.

This method of benefit packaging
has shown itself to be advantageous
to the employer as well. Since the
programs allow the worker to meet
their specific needs and desires,
the overall cost to the employer is
reduced by eliminating the less
desired benefits.

Another plus of the cafeteria
benefit program is the psychological
lift employees experience when given
measured control over a very im-
portant aspect of their work-life.
Any human being responds more posi-
tively when given a choice. The in-

with wild berry bushes and abundant
plants and herbs to satisfy her
love of nature. She needed neither
patterns nor power to create the
turn-of-the-century clothes until
her death in 1935. My mother recalls
how Granma would buy a length of
fabric, lay it out on the table,
look at it from one angle then an-
other, and then start to cut. She
sewed up the garment on a treadle
sewing machine and had a new dress
complete with the required leg-o-
mutton sleeves.

I remember a picture of Granma
taken shortly before her death.
She is seated under a tree looking
at a flower in her hand. With her
hair piled softly on top of her head
in a big bun and her old-fashioned
dress she was a striking reminder
of a colorful era. A remarkable
woman who met life on its terms and
came out even. I'm proud to be her
namesake.

increased awareness employees develop
as a result of these programs, as
to the costs of employee benefits
to the employer, can only serve to
improve the relationship between
the two.

Since the majority of the work
force is no longer "typical,"
these changes could foreshadow an
era of progress for women. For
example, a married woman could ex-
change on-site day care and/or
flextime scheduling for duplicate
medical coverage. In the past,
married women often did not util-
ize available medical plans because
their husbands already had adequate
coverage. The employer would gain
while the sacrificing employee re-
ceived no alternative compensation.

Unfortunately, women in the
past have tended to be reluctant
negotiators. They often operated
within a frame of reference that
fostered an attitude of gratitude
"for what they have." Through a
combination of attitudinal changes,
recognition of worth and increased
assertiveness, women can utilize
this burgeoning trend of changing
employee benefit programs to further
their positions in today's work
force.
