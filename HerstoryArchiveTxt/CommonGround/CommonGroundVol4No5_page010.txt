Do you want to grow herbs?  
Actually, the herbs will do the  
growing: but you will still have  
things to do. One question is to  
seed or not to seed. Daphne is  
of the school that mostly does not,  
and is impervious to pitying looks  
from friends who grow herbs from  
seeds in even their dish drainers  
and sink trays. Admittedly, some  
herbs, given the opportunity, will  
self-sow readily; for two, basil  
and aromatic chervil (if you can  
lay your hands on it in the first  
place). Some thymes will self-  
sow, too. Summer savory is so  
obvious with its seed heads that  
you may as well collect and sow  
them yourself in the early spring;  
plan on a second, summer sowing  
as this plant really burns up the  
track. This might seem the route  
to follow with basil as well, and  
Daphne for one has. But, a pro-  
lific harvest of basil seems most  
guaranteed by letting basil sow  
for itself. Fennel, though, will  
not object to being sown for.  
Neither will dill.

Not all herbs initially are  
sown most easily outdoors.  
Rosemary, rue, lavender (if it is  
to be grown from seed at all),  
hyssop and not marigold may be  
happiest sown indoors in sand  
filled flats under glass (or in  
vermiculite—expanded mica—if  
you let modernity touch upon  
your seed), or in little peat  
pots or egg cartons housed in  
those nasty non-organic but none-  
theless useful plastic bags, to  
create a desirable greenhouse  
effect in a window with a south-  
ern exposure. Be sure to make  
holes for drainage in your con-  
tainers. Do not overwater, and  
do use lukewarm water that has  
stood overnight to get rid of  
the chlorine. Do your sowing a  
month before you expect the last  
severe frost: gradually acclimate  
seedlings to the outdoors before  
transplanting. The shorter your  
growing season, the more likely  
you may want to try this approach  
to seeding. Whether you live North  
of Tennessee is another rough mea-  
sure of the desirability of in-  
door seeding.

Re. the plastic bags, they are  
indestructible; if you have them,  
you might as well re-use them.

Re. the herbs, chamomile also  
may be sown in this manner, but  

| will come forth single rather  
than double flowered; runners will  
give the most satisfactory plants.  
A runner is a slender stem that  
gives off roots at its joints

(nodes) or end; it will itself  
produce a new plant and may be  
severed from the parent plant to  
produce a new plant elsewhere.  
Runners will be encouraged es-  
pecially by wet summers, which  
discourage flowers and hence  
seed growth.

The main problems with herb  
seeds are as follows. For one  
thing, the seeds in packets are  
not necessarily fresh. Especially  
if you are looking at hard-to-  
find varieties—e.g., try to find  
ripe seeds of broom or anise—you  
had better steer clear of the  
pretty pictures on seed packets.  
Not-fresh seeds may yield a plant  
here and there; they also will  
facilitate empty spaces in the  
garden. Pre-existing perennials  
may fill in these spaces as summer  
wears on; but this may not be what  
you had in mind for the space.

For a second problem, some kinds  
of herb seeds germinate slowly and  
not at all uniformly. Angelica  
seed is an example. Angelica also  
may be propagated by placing in  
the ground a piece of root from a  
healthy mature plant. This piece  
of root is called rootstock. Root-  
stock includes runners and also  
rhizomes. With angelica, you are  
dealing with a rhizome. Unlike  
runners, which grow level with the  
ground, rhizomes present a subter-  
ranean stem, also horizontal and  
putting off roots and shoots. A  
rhizome is cut from the plant's  
main root without difficulty for  
the plant. The rootstock approach  
to growing angelica is faster and  
more regular than seeding is.

Lemon balm and costmary grow  
well from rootstock, too. The  
same may be said for mint and com-  
frey, whose seeds are scarce, and  
for so-called French tarragon,  
which happens never to set seed.  
(While we are on the subject of  
non-seeding herbs, we may think  
upon horseradish and some of the  
watercresses as well). Parsley  
is a slow germinator: Daphne's  
eldest daughter soaks the seeds  
in warm water before setting them  
out; and early sowing is important.  
Seeds of sweet and especially wild  
marjoram, feverfew and coriander  
also germinate slowly. (Wild mar-  
joram is called oregano and can  
be hard to distinguish from sweet  
marjoram.) Caraway seeds need to  
be sown the previous fall; and the  
seeds of sweet cicely—a kind of  
chervil also known as British myrrh  
or anise fern—take one full year  
to germinate. Herbs generally  
peak later than other plants, too.

For a third problem with herb  
seeds, as implied earlier, many  
herbs propagate best vegetatively,  
e.g., by rootstock. As many herbs  
will winter over, they are suited  

for this vegetative reproduction,  
although not always for territorial  
as opposed to gradual spread, which  
is heartening. All the means of  
vegetative propagation already  
described will, however, accomplish  
a certain amount of spread as well  
as reproduction. Already-existing  
plants may be divided, e.g., tansy,  
hyssop, lady's mantle, feverfew and  
lovage, which also will grow from  
seed, as will garden burnet and  
sorrel, and sweet woodruff but late.  
A plant is divided by removing it,  
root ball and all, from the ground,  
(assuming the plant is of a size  
permitting such removal); the roots  
and above ground growth are separa-  
ted gently into two or more clumps,  
then individually re-set into the  
ground at the plant's previous  
depth.

Herbs also may be grown from  
plant cuttings; examples of herbs  
growing in this fashion are lemon  
verbena, sage and rue, along with  
borage, lavender, wild marjoram  
and bergamot (which four also  
grow from rootstock). Cuttings  
are taken from the top of a stem  
and ought not be cut at all but  
instead, pinched off between the  
thumb and index finger. The  
pinch should be made only a short  
distance beyond a leaf joint, and  
the lowermost leaves pinched off,  
too; three leaves should remain  
on a stem about four inches long.  
Without foliage the cutting will  
not survive: but a lot of foliage  
will demand support a rootless  
piece of stem cannot give. Cut-  
tings are set to root in a medium  
such as sand, in the manner de-  
scribed for indoor seeding. The  
pinched end of the stem may be  
dipped lightly in rooting hormone  
(containing indolebutyric acid)  
available at the nursery.  
Follow the directions... Tansy,  
hyssop and feverfew provide only  
two more instances of this poten-  
tial for growth from cuttings.  
And, the thymes, bergamot and  
lemon balm will propagate vege-  
tatively in any way herein de-  
scribed.

One perhaps overlooked advan-  
tage to vegetative propagation is  
social: You often need to visit  
a friend's or some other garden  
to make it happen. If you won't  
or cannot visit, you may be able  
to provide yourself with materials  
for propagation by entering into  
correspondence with gardeners,  
in town or out, who will send you  
what you need from their own pro-  
geny. A bona fide gardener will  
jump at the chance. There is also  
the old hop-off-your-bike-or-from-  
your-car-and-dig approach, recom-  
mended mainly out of town and not  
recommended for protected species.  
Some gentians and ferns, e.g., are  
forbidden fruit. Confessedly,  
Daphne has found this approach use-
