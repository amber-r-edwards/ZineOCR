EMMA IS .

Looking forward to the holiday
season! There are some exciting new
releases this fall that will help solve
some of your gift-giving decisions! We
have selected four books and six calen-
dars to feature for holiday ordering.
Two of the books are releases of a
local feminist publishing company,
Margaretdaughters, Inc. We have
selected a group of wall calendars and
engagement calendars that all celebrate
women. Any of these selections would
make wonderful, thoughtful and thought
provoking gifts for yourself and/or
loved ones.

All of the books listed here are
paperback. A brief description of each
item listed on the order form is pro-
vided to assist you in making your
selection(s). We are also including a
list of titles previously or currently
carried at EMMA that have been very
popular throughout the year; there is
space on the order form to fill in any
of these titles that you wish to order.

Another idea for holiday shopping
is our EMMA and Common Ground supporter
plan. A $15 supporter card entitles
you to one year of shopping at EMMA at
10% discount on all taxable purchases.
A $25 supporter plan includes in addi-
tion to the year's discount a one-year
subscription to Common Ground.

We continue to feature the works of
local women artists and crafters in our
gallery/window. If you are interested
in having your work featured, please
contact us for more details.

EMMA is now closed on Mondays -- we
hope that this will be a temporary
inconvenience until we have more woman-
power. We are aware that our hours
have been sporadic, and this change is
one effort to alleviate some of the
frustration for both you and us in
finding us closed when we are supposed
to be open.

EMMA is located at 168 Elmwood Ave.
just south of North St. Our phone
number is 885-2285. As always, we
appreciate the support of women in our
community - you DO make it possible for
us to continue to serve our community.
If you have been thinking about the
possibility of becoming involved by
staffing or working with us in some
other way, please call us. We are
having a new member potluck on October
27 -- call us if you are interested in
more details.

ABOUT THE BOOKS ...

Feminism for the Health of It. Wilma
Scott Heide. Foreword by Jessie
Bernard, Margaretdaughters, Inc., 1985.
176 pp. $8.95. Weaving together her
unique humor, word creations, and
astute analysis, Heide offers tan-
talizing visions for a future that is
not only thinkable, but possible. With
sharp realism and passion, Heide
challenges the reader with feminism as
a values transformation that will revo-
lutionize language, higher education,
research and activism, health care,
economics, the media, and international
policy. She says: “This task is not for
sunshine matriots, careerists, fair-
weather faddists or ladylike leeches.
Passion is necessary to empower
courage, prophetic vision, intellectual
originality, psychic energy and commit-
ment to create and sustain change
movements." This is an essential book
for the 80's and beyond - it is a
vision of possibilities for a future of
health, peace and justice.

A Feminist Legacy: The Ethics of Wilma
Scott Heide and Company. Eleanor Humes
Haney. Foreword by Elizabeth Duncan
Koontz, Margaretdaughters, Inc., 1985.
198 pp. $12.95. An intriguing account
of the life and work of Wilma Scott
Heide, incorporating a history of the
National Organization for Women prior
to and during Wilma's presidency in the
70's, and an exploration of feminist
ethics as reflected in Wilma's life and
actions. The stories of Wilma's life
and NOW are traced from extensive
interviews, letters, and published and
unpublished papers. Wilma's ethic of
freedom, humaneness, and personal and
political excellence is told in context
with the ordinary events of her life.
Haney’s unique approach of “ethics as
story" creates an intimate portrait of
this impassioned and eloquent leader of
the feminist movement - a visionary and
activist who “lived her values."

Books:

With The Power of Each Breath: A
Disabled Women’s Anthology. Edited by
Susan E. Browne, Debra Connors, and
Nanci Stern, Cleis Press, 1985. 354 pp.
$9.95. One of the most powerful books
to be published this year, and the
first book to comprehensively document
the lives of disabled women. With the
publication of this book, Cleis Press
continues their tradition of publishing
the writings of women speaking of their
own realities in their own voices. All
of the contributions in this volume
speak clearly in challenging the
cultural norm of “able-ism"; reading it
creates an acute awareness for the non-
disabled woman, and bridges the gulf
that separates disabled women from one
another. With The Power of Each Breath
is a collection of writings from over
fifty disabled women and represents a
range of disabilities, age, race,
class, sexual preference and personal
background.

The Nutrition Detective: A Woman's
Guide to Treating Your Health Problems
Through The Foods You Eat. Nan Kathryn
Tarcher, Inc., 1985. 183 pp. $9.95. One
of the most refreshing nutrition books
that we have seen - this is not just
another diet book. Fuchs's basic
philosophy is "You are not what
you eat; what you eat is how you feel."
Her approach is direct and practical,
presenting a collection of knowledge
from various fields to better enable
the reader to make an informed decision
about what foods may or may not be
healthful. Including a health
assessment questionnaire, she guides
the reader in interpreting that
questionnaire and suggests ways in
which the reader actually becomes the
"detective" in selecting foods for
various health-related concerns.
Whether you are concerned about food
allergies, fatigue, headaches, bulimia,
candida, menopause, menstrual cramps,
osteoporosis, social drinking or
smoking, you will find interesting and
usable information in The Nutrition
Detective.
