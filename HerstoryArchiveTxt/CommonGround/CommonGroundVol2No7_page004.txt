Is care for your dependents prov-

ing to be taxing on your income?
Here is some information that you
can use in April, and some other
news that really is worth thinking
about.

Remember to use the Dependent

Tax Care Credit that allows employed
parents to claim a credit against what you
owe in taxes of up to 30% off the
allowable cost of child care.
The allowable cost for one child is
$2,400 and $4,800 for two or more
children.
for families with a total of $10,000
in household income.

increases above the $10,000 figure.
This can now be done on the short
form.

Another taxing idea is the DCAP
(Dependent Care Assistance Plan).

Employers can offer the plan as a
fringe benefit to employed parents.
Here is how it works—the employer
agrees to reduce the parent's monthly

paycheck before taxes, by the amount

For the employer, tax savings

are generated because neither Social
Security nor federal unemployment are
paid on these monies.

Also, the

employer can deduct the cost of the
child care payments as a legitimate
business expense, so reducing the
employer's tax bill.

Presidential hopefuls seized on

the birthday of Susan B. Anthony as
a way to close the gender gap.

Mondale said that Susan B. Anthony

who voted just once, illegally, voted
Republican, and that she was one of

a long line of women who were disap-
pointed by their party.

Reagan said that Susan B. Anthony

helped to “awaken our country's con-
science...we can all be proud that,

as women have taken on new roles in
American society, the GOP has given
them firm support.”

No punitive action will be taken
against the Westminster Presbyterian
Church for deciding to allow the
ordination of homosexuals as deacons
or elders.

The Presbytery of Western New
York passed a resolution that mildly
criticizes the Delaware Avenue
church, and acknowledges that the
congregation broke the law of the
General Assembly, the Presbytery's
governing body. It does not require,
however, that Westminster Church
change the policy.

The congregation of Westminster
had researched the issue of homo-
sexuality for over a year before
declaring themselves a “More Light"
congregation, one that allows for
the ordination of gays. There are
eighteen such groups nationwide.

Other members of the W.N.Y. Pres-
bytery wanted Westminster censured,
to remove that church's governing
body, but that proposal was voted
down 101-39. One elder said that
the debate is not over homosexuality
but over the deliberate disobedience
of church law that bars homosexuals
from ordination.

...-Remember the Iowa City Firefighter
who won a 1979 civil rights suit per-
mitting her to breast-feed her baby
while on duty? Well, Linda Eaton re-
signed in 1980, but she subsequently
charged a sex-discrimination claim
against the city officials who, she
alleged, did little to alter the be-
havior of her fellow firefighters
towards her. However, she recently
lost her claim.

She alleged that her co-workers,
according to a UPI report, “dumped
salt in [her] orange juice, defaced
her photograph, slashed her clean-
up gloves, threw her to the floor,
and denied her the use of the fire
station's television and table ten-
nis set."

However, John Hayek, attorney for
the city, won on the basis of his
argument that she was only the butt
of practical jokes rather than harass-
ment. He also pointed out that a
firehouse naturally includes "rough
language", and he contended that an
employer cannot dictate how employees
think. Hayek said Eaton's “own be-
havior" had made several co-workers
dislike her.

It seems that “throwing someone
to the floor" is a practical joke
of the same degree as salting O.J...

A study conducted by the National
Council of Churches reports that re-
ligious groups and churches are play-
ing an increasingly important role
in providing child care in the
United States. The study estimates
that churches provide 40-70% of all
available center-based child care.

Almost all church-sponsored day
care centers are open to the community

and 80% operate more than 30 hours
per week. Less than 16% have reli-
gious orientations. About 50% are
operated by the church and others
are independent using church facil-
ities. Subsidies from the churches

are used by 94% of the centers.

A hearing room at the Mahoney
State Office Building in Buffalo
was jammed with people on February
16, many of whom were there to pro-
test the re-opening of the West
Valley radioactive waste burial site.

The testimony, which started at
2 pm, continued until after 10 pm.
Several groups aimed their negative
remarks at a state report that sug-
gested options for disposal of low-
level nuclear wastes. Options sug-
gested were the re-opening of the
West Valley site, storage in above
ground tanks near the generation
point, ocean dumping and reducing
the amount that is now being pro-
duced.

Groups, including the Sierra
Club, Operation Clean, Citizens
Against Pollution, New York Public
Interest Research Group, the West
Valley Coalition and other ecology
minded organizations offered recom-
mendations that will be included in
a report that will be submitted to
the governor on April 1st.

A veteran Washington journalist,
known for her sharp questioning of
the powers-that-be said that members
of the Nixon administration were
babes in the woods at press manipu-
lation compared to the current ad-
ministration's handling of the fifth
estate.

Sarah McClendon, brought to
Buffalo by the Buffalo Chapter of
Women in Communication and Sigma
Delta Chi, the Society of Profes-
sional Journalists, complained
about the lack of information on
everything from finances to military
involvement.

Ms. McClendon, who runs McClendon
News Services, said that she and
other reporters are now researching
a story of corruption involving de-
fense contractors that is "far big-
ger than Watergate". She said that
U.S. citizens are underinformed on
everything from Federal Reserve
Board policies to the reasons for

the Grenada invasion.

A study published at Harvard is

diametrically opposed to the White
House task force paper on hunger in

America. The commission of educators,
clergy, doctors and social
workers concluded that hunger and
malnutrition are widespread and

because of inflation, unemployment,
and government policy.

The report asks Congress to in-
crease funding 25-30 percent to
such programs as Food Stamps, Aid
