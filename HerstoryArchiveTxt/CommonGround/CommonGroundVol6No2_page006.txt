Kate Waters: Alaskan

by Peg Martin Clements

It is said that space and the ocean
floors are the last frontiers on earth.
On a visit to Alaska in 1971, at the
age of fifteen, Kate Waters found her
frontier. She stayed to learn, to grow
and to create. She was to become a
recognized artisan of leather and
beadwork in a synthesis of style
derived from a continuing Native
American tradition.

Mary Choate, a Tlingit Indian and
native of Klukwan, became Kate's friend.
Under Mary's tutelage, Kate learned
Indian beadwork, working with leather,
preserving fish and meat, and other
skills of the Indian native culture.

Today, Kate lives in a rustic cabin
eight miles outside Haines. She hauls
her water, chops her wood to burn for
heat, and lights her cabin with kerosene
or propane lamps.

She preserves salmon berries, wild
strawberries, vegetables, and salmon
which she catches. On occasion, moose,
elk, or bear which she and friends hunt
are preserved. On one hunt, she shot an
elk and with help, quartered it, dressed it,
and then carried forty pounds of meat
back to the cabin. She grows only
cabbage, potatoes, and root vegetables
because the growing season is not long.

Her mode of transportation is
walking. Sometimes friends passing by
seeing her trudging to town stop to
give her a lift.

In 1982, Kate participated in a
beadwork show at the Edward Peat
Museum of Decorative Arts in Cherry Valley,
California. She also has exhibited her
works in Haines, Juneau, and Fairbanks
Fur Rendezvous.

She displays and sells her one-of-a-
kind designs for living art, clothing,
and accessories at southern Alaskan
shows and fairs during the summer. Some
customers contact Kate directly, select
their item to be designed, and designate
the leather, beads, or other
trim to be used.

Her works are created
with a deep respect for the
Pacific Northwest Coast
sources, methods, and
materials incorporated in
her designs.

Handcrafted commissioned
pieces may take from one to
three months, depending upon
the size, complexity, and
materials used. Typically,
the articles range from
wall-hangings or ornamental
deerskin and moosehide to
fringed leather handbags and
sealskin backpacks with
beaded design panels; from
braided and laced cowhide
shirts to elegantly ornate
tunics and deerskin dance
dresses. Coats, jackets,
and vests can be trimmed with ermine and otter or
panels of velvet and beads with silver
conchos, brass, ivory, abalone shell, and
porcupine quills.

The articles created in the cabin workshop
(Kate smiles and says, "Now that the designs
sell far and wide, the cabin has become a
studio.") reflect not only the rugged
environment and cultural themes, but the
special interests and lifestyles not only of
the artist but the buyer.

Kate reached a frontier, Alaska. In doing so
she found a new frontier of soul and mind
unencumbered by role playing, bigotry, or the
rush and crush of modern technology. This has
freed her to be herself - independent and an
artist.
