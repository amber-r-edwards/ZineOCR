The matter of getting referred.  
There is no agency in the Buffalo area  
which deals exclusively with referrals  
to non-sexist therapists, but you can  
try Crisis Services Counseling (834-  
3131) for general referral and Woman-  
Focus (842-1766) which may be able to  
tell you how to find therapists with  
a feminist orientation.  

Finding a compatible therapist is  
not always easy - so don't expect it  
to be. It might take more than one  
attempt and it may be a difficult and  
painful process. Even though the sex,  
the experience and the fee of the  
therapist may be right, you both may  
not see eye to eye on some important  
things. Trust your instincts. If  
for some reason you don't feel com-  
fortable, or you're not making any  
headway after a reasonable time, or  
if you feel that the therapist is not  
really interested in your problem or  
tries to force her or his values on  
you - end it - and look for someone  

else. 24

If you have decided that psycho-  
therapy is what you need, then don't  
give up. Persist until you find the  
therapist you need.
