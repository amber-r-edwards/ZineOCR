LO A ES OS

As my brother abused me.

I have asked myself why this does
not seem to be a priority issue.
Perhaps because any issue between
two children is considered not im-
portant. Because a 15 year old boy
who abuses is less likely to be
recognized than a father who does
the same.

It was not considered important
by my family. If my brother beat me
up, it was my fault; I was loud, I
teased too much. They saw my bruises
but my brother could not have done
this. They suggested perhaps some-
thing was wrong with my health, that

and verbal abuse were ignored.
Because of my feelings as a victim

of brother/sister abuse, I share simi>
larities with other victims of family
abuse. There is a conflict because,
though someone is abusing you, you
love them and are close to them.

Your family and friends reinforce
this. There is a feeling that it
must be your fault.

I would like to help bring this
situation into the open and have
discussion around this issue. If
there are other women in this com-
munity who feel they are or have been
victims of brother/sister abuse in
any form, please contact me so we can
discuss this issue together. I am
