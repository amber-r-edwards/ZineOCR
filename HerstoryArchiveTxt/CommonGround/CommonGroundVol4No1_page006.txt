terfire Sisterfire

"it is significant that we want to
come together near Washington, D.C.
We want to proclaim that women

will not let this or any administra-
tion strip us of our rights or our
humanity."

Susan Freundlich and Ronnie Gil-
bert both spoke of the changes that
have occurred through the struggles
to gain the rights of all people.
Susan praises Sisterfire for doing
the best job for securing accessibility
for the differently-abled, as
deaf artists are involved months
beforehand with the planning and
organizing. She sees festivals
like Sisterfire as a "beautiful
flower of those struggles." For
Ronnie, they celebrate that women
"are about ceasing wars, about sav-
ing the planet, about the rights of
all people, about stopping hunger...
Women's music affirms myself as a
woman."

Sisterfire is the flower affirm-
ing all of us, in all our diversity.
