A New Kind of Kitchen Poem  

It follows me  

everywhere  

Scent of supper onions  
superonions  
super-supper—hungry-onions  
Scent that refuses to be  
soaped away  

scrubbed away  

vinegar-baking-soda-lemon-juice-bleached  

away  

There must be a chant  
ritual  

a spell to cast  
Perhaps  

sacrifice delivered  

to the great Altar of Onion  

Am I wasting my time  

with bars of Fels Naptha  
and hand lotion  

Should there be instead  
half moon through a birch  
Palm full of rock salt  
stirred with  

nine broken matchsticks  

just think  

all those layers  

of papery skin  
delicate watery rings  
They must have been  
watching me  

exhaling their poison  

laughing at me  

while I chopped  

and wiped fine beads  

of oven-sweat  

from my forehead  

Oh my god,  

not my forehead too  
and my ear  

where I had an itch  
and my neck  

I feel doomed  

to the dumpster  

Never to be kissed again  
Shunned like  

Mange on a rat  

garlic on a date  

The bride

I will spend my evenings  
circulating Lace Curtains and Geraniums  

in search of new prey  

By the way I had not seen the like of them  
what are you having since the gray house on  
for supper tonight Lincoln Street  

back in the 30's...  
and here they were, across the sea  
Leah M. Kloss in every deep-silled window.  

My mother planted hers  

geraniums, I mean, in Jewel Co.  

coffee cans. Watered, snipped and  

tended; still they grew in awkward shapes  

her other children; leggy, having little grace  
and less of bloom, for want of light.  

In my mind they live with roses  

in the thread-bare parlor rug,  

the Morris chair in imitation leather  
the dome-shaped Philco squawking  

One Man's Family.  

Another kind of yearning  

I suppose, geraniums...  

a hanging on when reason  

tells you better. Like singing  
while the summer lasts  

in Norway.
