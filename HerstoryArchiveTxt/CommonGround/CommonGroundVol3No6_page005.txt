Barbara Wilson, The Seal Press,  
1984, $7.95, 183 pp.  

The new feminist "who dunnit”  
is following in the mysterious  
footsteps of Agatha Christie,  
P.D. James and Amanda Cross with  
strong female protagonists, good  
plot lines and characters you  
want to read more about. Three  
new books out this year, AMATEUR  
CITY with police detective Kate  
Delafield, A Nyla Wade Mystery,  
THE BURNTON WIDOWS about a re-  
porter/detective, and MURDER IN  
THE COLLECTIVE with fledgling  
problem solver and printshop whiz  
Pam Nilsen, present characters  
that just might take their places  
in the hearts of many women  
mystery-lovers, the way Cor-  
delia Grey, Miss Marple, Nancy  

Drew or Trixie Belden.  

All three novels have the ser-  
ious, devious and twisted plots  
with jumps and surprises rel-  
ished by mystery fans and are  
filled with interesting, believe-  
able characters. They are re-  
freshingly dissimilar in plot,  
politics and tone from each  
other, unlike some early fem-  
inist science-fiction and fantasy  
books. The main women charac-  
ters are presented in the con-  
text of their whole lives: as  
women who are detectives/re-  
porters/printers and as people  
who are intelligent, articulate,  
and professional, who solve  
crimes, and who are also 3 dim-  
ensional women.  

What makes all three books  
just a little different from the  
"classics," and what makes them  
similar to each other is that  
all these female sleuths are  
Lesbian.  

In AMATEUR CITY, LAPD Detective  
Kate Delafield is on the scene of  
the grisly murder of a despicable  
man no one liked. The prime wit-  
ness is a newly hired office wor-  
ker and the prime suspects are  
everyone else. She must evaluate  
the scene, interrogate witnesses  
and make her sloppy co-worker pay  
attention to details in order to  

solve the crime. This book is in  
the hard-boiled police drama mold  

and is gritty and fun. There  
are romantic twists and turns  
and some lovely realistic love  
scenes which nicely spice this  
novel.  

The Burnton Widows are intro-  
duced to the reader in a very  
romantic, sympathetic opening  
chapter. The scene is a special  
occasion these lovers are cele-  
brating. Unfortunately, these  
wonderful women are brutally mur-  
dered in their beds. Ever nosy  
reporter-cum-detective Nyla Wade  
tries to re-open their murder  
investigation a year later, barely  
two days after arriving in town  
and hearing their story. Nyla  
thinks they pinned the murders on  
the wrong man and is determined  
to find the real culprit. She  
discovers an informal "information"  
network of friends quick to help  
her (and a hidden enemy) while  
solving this mystery.  

MURDER IN THE COLLECTIVE is a  
complex novel about a printing  
collective, twin sisters, Philipine  
Liberation, class and race con-  
sciousness, collective process,  
“coming out as a lesbian”....and  
oh yeah, the murder! The novel  
has it all - solid murder-  
plot twists and turns, surprises,  
intrigue, false clues and romance.  
It is not dull, boring or pedan-  
tic and was a pleasure to read,  
because its setting a collect-  
ive (it could be any women's or  
activist group) and because Bar-  
bara Wilson so accurately por-  
trays the subtle group dynamics.  
Any woman who works in an act-  
ivist group (or is on a bowling  
team for that matter) can ident-  
ify with the background of this  
novel and will enjoy Wilson's  
insights.  

Pam Nilson of Best Printing  
tries, with the help of Hadley  
from B. Violet Typesetting to  
discover who murdered one of her  
collective members, and trashed  
the B. Violet shop. The cops  
are having no luck at all with  
this one and Pam & Hadley team  
up to psyche out their co-work-  
ers (and the cops) and discover  
much more than a "simple" mur-  
der. What fun!  

These novels are fun to read  
and could make the start of a  
women's mystery novel collection,  
or broaden a collection of  
classics.  

These and other mystery novels  
are available at Emma, 168 Elm-  
wood Ave, Buffalo 885-2285.

WNY HISTORY  

REVIEW: Jamestown and Chautauqua  
County: An Illustrated History  
by B. Dolores Thompson  

Reviewed by Sharon Green  

Are Katherine Harris, Kate  
Stoneman and Calista Jones fam-  
iliar names to you? If they are  
not, then Dolores Thompson would  
like to reach you, especially if  
you are a Western New Yorker.  

Thompson is the author of  
Jamestown and Chautauqua County:  
An Illustrated History (1984:  
Windsor Publications, Woodland  
Hills, California). Even though  
our preview copy was received a  
few months after its publication,  
we are always proud to showcase  
the accomplishments and talents  
of Western New York women, and  

especially when their writing is  
doing the work of our foremothers.  

When I taught an introductory  
Women's Studies course a few years  
ago, I observed that one of the  
most palatable (and certainly the  
least threatening) topics was  
women's history. Since we have  
all suffered through years of  
history instruction (written  
mainly by men and dealing almost  
exclusively with men's achieve-  
ments), it is both exhilarating  
and frightening to suddenly rea-  
lize how much was omitted from  
our past instruction.  

Indeed, the Women's Movement  
has prompted scholars, writers  
and feminists alike to question  
not only the very notion of what  
is historically noteworthy, but  
also who makes such crucial  
decisions. It was in this spirit  
that Thompson, the former director  
of the Fenton Historical Society  
and the City of Jamestown's his-  
torian since 1978, compiled this  
important addition to the existing  
historical material on Chautauqua  
County.  

Unlike writers of many stan-  
dard history books, Thompson  
repeatedly integrates women,  
whether or not they have nota-  
ble achievements to cite, as  
is to remind the readers of their  
very existence. So that we don't  
forget that half the population,  
during a discussion of the poli-  
tics of Chautauqua County's legis-  
lature, for example, the author  
is quick to remind us that, "Few  
women have chosen to run for of-  
fice, and even fewer have been  
elected." Certainly such an ap-  
proach is quite different than  
the usual blatant omission of  
women.  

In addition to the three im-  
portant women mentioned above,  
Thompson intersperses her chrono-  
logical accounts with some sig-  
nificant accomplishments of the  
women of the Southern Tier. Here  
are a few examples:  

- In the 1850's, the first 6  
churches to be established in  
then-burgeoning Dunkirk were com-  
prised largely of women.  

- The Grange, founded in Fre-  
donia in 1868, admitted women to  
its ranks from the beginning, as  
an example of their belief in the  
equality of the sexes.  

- In 1887, a Political Equality  
Club was organized in Jamestown,  
as a response to the suffrage  
movement that had come out of the  
Seneca Falls Convention some 29  
years earlier.  

- In 1889, this club managed  
to get 2 women elected to the  
School Board in Jamestown. And  
even though American women could  
not yet vote, Jamestown's women  
could at least vote in their  
school elections.  

Thompson writes in a straight-  
forward and precise style, cram-  
ming in as many facts as possible  
in a book whose length was res-  
tricted by its publisher. It is  
regrettable, however, that more  
room wasn't available for her to  
recount the achievements of the  
many women of the Southern Tier  
who did their work out of the  
public eye. Except for passing  
mention of quilting bees, corn-  
ing and dances, women's work  

in the home and within the fam-  
ily has again been largely ig-  
nored. This is particularly  
disappointing in light of the  
rich ethnicity of Chautauqua  
County women. (For example,  
Jamestown was populated by  
large groups of Swedes, Ital-  
ians and Albanians, to name a  
few.)  

Despite this omission, Jamestown  
and Chautauqua County: An  
Illustrated History is well worth  
the $19.95 price, especially if  
intended as a gift. A visually  
appealing work (with several  
full-page photos of women such  
as Katherine Harris and Susan B.  
Anthony, a frequent visitor and  
speaker in the county) printed  
on thick, rich paper, it fills  
at least some of the huge void  
in our historical knowledge.  
Hopefully, the price will not  
be prohibitive to many readers,  
especially women who often have  
either no salary or little room  
in an already tight budget for  
book purchases.  

* Katherine Harris was a Black  
woman who ran an underground  
railroad "stop" in Jamestown  
before the Civil War. Kate  
Stoneman, a Chautauqua County  
native, fought to become the  
first woman attorney in New York  
State. Calista Jones was an  
educator who refused to replace  
a male principal when offered  
a salary lower than his. Event-  
ually, the Jamestown Board of  
Education upped the offer, to  
make her the first professional  
Jamestown woman to receive a  
salary equal to that of a man  
(in the previous century!).
