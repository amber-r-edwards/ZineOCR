As the Women's Encampment for a  
Future of Peace and Justice was  
winding down in late August and  
planning for a closing Labor Day  
demonstration at the Seneca Army  
Depot, reporters and other observ-  
ers were asking the question,  

"Do you think the Encampment was a  
success?”  

I respond to that question with  
a resounding "Yes!". Yes, because  
it fulfilled the stated goals of  
the encampment, and because my  
experience at the camp allowed me  
to participate in alternative ways  
of organizing and of working out  
decisions in situations of con-  
flict with people  

from varied back—  

perspective and opinion was re-  
spected, and seemed to strengthen  
the unity that was necessary and  
evident in meeting the underlying  
purpose for the Encampment: to  
join with women throughout the  
world in expressing opposition to  
the deployment of Pershing II and  
cruise missiles in Europe scheduled  
to begin later this year; and to  
join with women in an environmental  
structure according to feminist,  
non-violent values, and where the  
divisive elements of racism, sexism,  
militarism, etc., are unacceptable,  
and when necessary, confronted.  

Many Buffalo area women spent  
several days at the Encampment  
during the week of July 17. Our  
2 -1/4 hour ride to Romulus was  
nothing compared to that of others  
who arrived that day - 15 people  
from Buffalo bicycled "for Peace"  
for 2 - 1/2 days, and two busloads  
of Women Against Military Madness  
(WAMM) traveled 27 hours from  
Minnesota to add their unique  
character to the camp that week.  

Groups and individuals had been  
encouraged by camp organizers to —  
bring workshops and projects to add  
to the schedule of daily programs.  
Women's Action for Nuclear Dis-  
armament (WAND) brought a number of  
such activities including some herbs  
that were planted near the Depot  
fence to signify the beginning of  
conversion of the Depot to a nurtur-  
ing, life-giving purpose. WAND mem-  
bers continue to work on the Penta-  
gon Ribbon that Justine Merritt led  
in a workshop all week long. Indi-  
viduals or groups from the camp were  
invited to express a meaningful sign  
of life through needlework on a

bon to be tied around the Pentagon  
on the 40th anniversary of Hiro-  
shima, August 6, 1985, and then  
taken to the Peace Museum in Chicago.  
The WNY Peace Center's Friendly  
Creature Features puppet show en-  
tertained a young audience at the  
gate one sunny afternoon. And the  
popular Dragon of Life, an ancient  

symbol for "seeing clearly" had tak-  
en shape in Delaware Park on July 3  
as sheets decorated with colorful  
images and symbols of hope. The  
torso grew as campers added their  
images throughout the week. As  
the  

focus of demonstrations  
grew, the dragon called for us to  

see more clearly that the  

future of the earth and its people.  

Daily orientation workshops pro-  
vided necessary information about  
camp structure and policy: sign-  
ups for daily 3-hr. “work webs"—  
cooking, cleaning, building, greet-  
ing visitors, office work, security,  
etc.; a common evening meal which  
was shared and always seemed to  
stretch just far enough; the eve-  
ning camp meeting where skilled  
facilitators clarified agendas,  
mediated diverse perspectives on  
issues toward consensus decision-  
making, called for reports, an-  
nouncements and evaluations of the  
day's activities, and finally, led  
the women in a unifying closing  
circle.  

Other workshops included films  
and speakers on disarmament issues,  
Native American women, Comiso Women's  

PEACE  

Camp in Italy, Nonviolence training,  
etc. All of this amid a lifestyle  
that included port-o-johns, trucked  
in water, underground cooling pits  
for refrigeration and fire pits for  
cooking.  

Meanwhile, back at the Depot,  
women encountered the fence; some  
climbed over, some crawled under,  
some chained themselves to the gate,  
some pitched tents on the airfield  
runway; at times they were detained  
and processed and at other times  
they exited the way they entered.  
Early one morning, Depot personnel  
were surprised to find the water  
tower, which is a few hundred feet  
inside the Main gate and carries  
the motto “Mission First, People  
Always", had been touched up with  
paint (and with agility) to read  
only "People Always". Vigils,  
daytime and evening, were held  
regularly. One Friday evening a  
group of Jewish women from Roch-  
ester shared a supper with the camp  
and held a candlelight Sabbath  
service at the main gate.  

My first trip to the Depot from  
the camp was as part of such a si-  

lent procession and vigil. My  
feelings that night were typical of  
most women's reactions, for it  
brought us to profound reali-  

zations about the impact of war  
on all our lives. We stood there,  
dressed in camp attire, singing or  
in silence, holding our candles  
while facing uneasy young men on  
the other side of the fence, dres-  
sed in riot gear, looking beyond  
our shoulders, holding their clubs.  
As sisters and mothers faced bro-  
thers and sons, we became deeply  
aware that we are all victims of a  
common enemy - the nuclear arms  
race.  

At another vigil that week women  
brought personal symbols of life,  
family pictures, banners, etc. to  
attach to the fence. One woman hung  
an army uniform, one that was worn  
by her husband in the Vietnam war.  
As she hung it on the fence, she  
explained to the soldiers nearby  
that she presented this with the  
hope and concern that they will
