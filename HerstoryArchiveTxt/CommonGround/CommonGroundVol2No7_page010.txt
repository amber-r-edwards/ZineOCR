Dance is one of the most ancient  
forms of human expression...from the  
movements of a child who sways in  
time to the music, to ritual, worship  
and the more contemporary stylized  
personal statements, dance has been  
an art form that covers all the human  
ways of being.  

Modern dance, developed by Martha  
Graham in the '20s, is a style that  
speaks loudly to women. Graham mixed  
classic ballet styles with a more  
natural, more energetic presentation  
to create a very female and uniquely  
American form of dance.  

Women who perform in modern dance  
are offered a much wider range of  
movements, of interpretations and of  
styles of dance than are their sisters  
in classic ballet. Women in modern  
dance are not showcased and escorted  
as they are in ballet, nor do they  
depend on male dancers to perform the  
more athletic feats in a piece.  

Ballet is an exhibition of control  
for women; modern dance is an exercise  
in expression. Modern dancers move  
in ways that may exaggerate some  
natural movements, but never invent  
postures or positions that are not  
based on the natural or normal range.  
Ballet, with its emphasis on the use  
of the toe shoes, and maintained  
postures, does.  

Women in modern dance leap, jump,  
spin and fly, all on their own power.  
If dance is art, and art reflects  
life, then every woman can dance, leap  
and fly--all on her own power.

The curtain at Shea's Buffalo will  
be rising on March 28 at 8 pm on  
this season's most exciting modern  
dance event. The Gemini Dance Theater  
will be celebrating its 10th anniver-  
sary with a program par excellence,  
including Thea Barnes of the Martha  
Graham Modern Dance Company, princi-  
pals from the Toronto Modern Dance  
community, and others to present a  
series of dances on the topic of  
human rights.  

The Gemini Dance Company is spon-  
soring this event in coalition with  
a number of community groups for the  
mutual benefit of all. This coalition  
that includes EMMA and Common Ground,  
is a new idea that will help to unite  
the arts with the people and concerns  
in our community.  

Some of the other organizations  
included in this coalition are The  
Gay and Lesbian Community Center,  
the Buffalo Chapter of the National  
Organization for Women, West Side  
Repertory Theater and the Center  
for Positive Thought.  

Join us for this important event  
at Shea's on March 28. Tickets are  
available through the mail-in coupon  
in this issue of CG, at EMMA, 168  
Elmwood Ave., and through the other  
community groups mentioned.  

Thea Barnes, the featured dancer  
in the much acclaimed Gemini Dance  
Theater's 10th Anniversary performance,  
has an enviable career as a soloist  
in the Martha Graham Dance Company,  
but getting there wasn't easy.  

Born on Chicago's South Side, she  
was educated to be a pianist, because  
her sister was, and still is, a  
dancer. Thea had some dance training,  
but decided on it as a career after  
seeing Judith Jamison of the Alvin  
Ailey Company perform. She auditioned  
for and was accepted by the Dance  
Theater of Harlem. Members of her  
family pooled their resources to get  
her plane fare to New York.  

She was further educated at the  
Juilliard School, and has a Bachelor  
of Fine Arts in Dance. She is now a  
soloist with the Martha Graham Dance  
Company and the Chamber Dance Company.  

Thea Barnes has performed on  
Broadway, in Scott Joplin's "Treemon-  
isha" and in both the stage and  
film versions of "The Wiz". Tele-  
vision appearances include the NET/  
PBS productions of Alvin Ailey's  
"Memories and Visions" and Martha  
Graham's "Clytemnestra".  

Barnes is the Artistic Director/  
Instructor for the League of Better  
Community Life Performing Arts Pro-  
gram in N.Y., an instructor at Martha  
Graham School of Dance, and has re-  
cently done an educational tour in  
Denmark.  

Thea Barnes will be performing  
in Buffalo on March 28th, at 8 pm,  
at Shea's. Her dancing is fluid,  
her technique, flawless. You will  
never forget that you have seen her.
