Do you have any young children that  
you remember on holidays? If so, let  
me recommend as an Easter gift a copy  
of a wonderful book entitled The Coun-  
try Bunny and the Little Gold Shoes,  
written by DuBose Heyward and illus-  
trated by the well-known Marjorie  
Flack. Heyward wrote this book in  
1939 for his only child, Jenifer, who  
was nine at the time. Although it  
seems an unlikely book to have been  
written by a man, perhaps his daughter  
inspired him to create a positive role  
model for girls.

Holiday traditions are rooted in  
lots of sexism, and Easter is no ex-  
ception. Women do overtime in the  
kitchen on most of these "holidays."  
On Halloween, girls dress up as Cab-  
bage Patch dolls or witches, while  
boys pretend to be He-Man or pirates.  
Santa Claus is a man but Mrs. Claus  

is merely his handmaiden who keeps the  

home fires burning. Easter customs,  
however, are somewhat less sex-biased  
with one exception: the Easter “Sunny.”  
It's always been a "he."

However, author Heyward tosses that  
rigid notion aside. In fact, he an-  
swers every skeptical five-year-old's  
query of "How can the Easter Bunny  

Book Review:

THE COUNTRY BUNNY

(or Santa) go to all those houses in  
one night?" by having five Easter  
Bunnies. And as each one grows older  
and slower, a replacement is sought.

The Country Bunny, who has always  
aspired to one day becoming one of  
the select 5, but whose career is  
temporarily put on hold while she  
has her babies, is scorned by "…  
the big white rabbits and the Jacks  

—" who inform her that "only a  
country bunny would go and have all  
those babies. Now take care of them  
and leave Easter eggs to great big  
men bunnies like us."

Not one to be deterred by such  
blatant discrimination, she imagi-  
natively trains her 21 children to  
assume all the household tasks in  
her absence. Using skills that all  
mothers should include on their re-  
sumes, such as managing, coordi-  
nating, delegating responsibilities,  
and using tact and psychology, she  
is then able to leave them alone  
and in charge.

So her wisdom and kindness; not  
to mention her natural ability to  
run swiftly, wins her the job as  
one of the Easter Bunnies. But the  
story doesn't end here. Heyward  

Review:

GOLD SHOES

doesn't merely give readers some-  
one to admire; he gives them a true  
heroine. After an exhausting night  
of delivering eggs, she attempts to  
reach the mountaintop house of a  
sick child. Halfway up, she slips  
on the ice and hurts her leg. Just  
then, her "employer," Grandfather  
Bunny (yes, men are still in posi-  
tions of power) appears. As a re-  
ward for her brave attempt, he be-  
stows on her a pair of gold shoes  
which enable her to fly success-  
fully to this last child's house.  
At daybreak, she then returns to a  
clean and orderly house with eggs  
for her own children.

Do consider this marvelous ex-  
ample of non-sexist children's  
literature for any 3 to 10 year-  
olds you care about. It is availa-  
ble at Elmwood Books (410 Elmwood)  
and Ulbrich's downtown, in paper-  
back. It can be ordered in paper-  
back or hardcover from EMMA book-  
store (168 Elmwood Avenue), Talking  
Leaves Bookstore (3144 Main  
Street), Walden's Bookstore or  
B. Dalton Bookstore in the Thru-  
way Mall.

The Color Purple

It is early 1986, and every fem-  
inist periodical in the country, as  
well as most mainstream media pub-  
lications, is carrying a review of  
The Color Purple. Alice Walker  
wrote the book, Steven Spielberg  
directed the film, Whoopi Goldberg  
stars in it; and the opening of  
this movie is an event long awaited  
by fans of these artists and by  
many other people. The movie is  
getting mixed reviews, however.  
Many of the mainstream and alterna-  
tive presses rave about it, while  
many others indicate disappointment.

For a different approach, some  
CG members and friends had a col-  
lective movie-going afternoon, with  
hopes of compiling our reactions  
for a composite review. As you may  
have guessed, the reviews, again,  
were mixed.

The Color Purple, as of this  
writing, is playing in an exclusive  
area engagement at University Cinema  
on Maple Road. We found ourselves  
lucky to see it at all in its open-  
ing week, as all four shows the day  
we attended appeared to have sold out.

TAGF 6 COMMON GROUND MARCH 1986

and finding we were headed for the  
same movie they had left, we were  
told to hurry in for tickets and  
bring the Kleenex. The audience we  
filed in with was one of the most  
demographically diverse I have seen  
at any recent movie, though with  
numbers slightly favoring women and  
Blacks.

Most of us found the need for  
Kleenex was a real one within the  
first ten minutes. The Color Purple  
is a very powerful film, and it  
seemed no one in the audience moved  
from their seats for the duration of  
the movie.

The fact that we left with dif-  
fering reactions may be due in part  
to Alice Walker having written a  
book it would be very hard to live  
up to. The one woman among us who  
had not read the book liked the  
movie very much. Of the rest of  
us, there were none who regretted  
the snowy afternoon trek to the  
theater to see the movie, and  
many of us were very moved by it.  
Still, all voiced to various de-  
grees, "But I wish they had  
shown..."

Some examples: other reviews  
and general discussion we had heard  
of the movie had prepared us for  
Spielberg's downplaying of the  
"lesbian scene" between Shug and  
Celie. Their kissing was not al-  
together chaste, but was not ela-  
borated further. More disappointing  
was that this degree of intimate  
relationship between the two women  
is not shown as a continuing one.  
This relationship is central in the  
book, and in the movie is reduced  
to merely one scene. They hardly  
touch again, and it is not clear  
that they even live together on  
any more than a "I'll drop in oc-  
casionally with the friends and  
my husband” basis.

Spielberg has said that he didn't  
want this to be seen as a "lesbian  
film" and thereby narrow his audi-  
ence when there were other important  
issues and themes to be expressed,  
and perhaps that is understandable. If  
one of the themes is the subjugation  
of Black people in that era,  
he does succeed, at least in part.
