New From Judy Grahn

by Koré Archer

MUNDANE'S WORLD by Judy Grahn.  
Freedom, CA: Crossing Press, 1988.  
191 pages, $10.95 paperback.

Once a form is created it  
creates other forms and not  
just those like itself, often  
it creates other forms unlike  
itself in order to give itself  
limits, company and  
composition. As the bright  
eyes of a mama mouse watch  
from the mounds of straw on  
the floor of the stable, so a  
white chested owl dreams on a  
rafter near the roof of the  
stable. The two are related  
especially in the time they  
spend thinking about each  
other.

Poet Judy Grahn has just  
completed her first novel,  
MUNDANE'S WORLD.

At first glance, MUNDANE'S WORLD  
might strike you as a naive "animal  
story" or another feminist utopia  
yarn; this book is neither. If you  
read on, this book will soon have  
you closely observing and even  
looking out through the eyes of  
every life form in the ancient,  
bustling city called Mundane. With  
hypnotic dispassion, Grahn  
interweaves with her human  
characters the plans and destinies  

of a thirsty oak, a team of ants, a  
newborn fly, a scheming weed, a  
keen-eyed buzzard, and even the  
corpse resting uneasily high on a  
platform on the eastern edge of the  
City. (In this story,  
sentimentality and disgust, habits  
that can separate us from the  
various biologies around us, have  
no place.) In the elaborate  
rightness of each creature's  
interlocking role there is lingering  
mystery, not to mention the mystery  
lingering about the body of the  
high priestess of architecture,  
dead of a peculiar head injury and  
now softening in the sun high on a  
platform heavy with meaning.

Grahn, an admirer of Gertrude  
Stein and a poet, after all, takes  
outrageous liberties with the  
language, opening up a range of  
sound and rhythm impossible within  
"correct English." Her prose,  
which often has the same  
foreign-yet-intelligible effect as  
writing skillfully translated from  
another language, transports - but  
only if you're willing to let go of  
the grammar rules they taught you  
in school. This intentional  
playfulness may mislead some  
readers. (A recent review of  
MUNDANE'S WORLD in the Southern  
California periodical, Lesbian  
News, comments on "the nagging  
flurry of errors that both Grahn  

and Crossing Press editors have  
allowed to slip through.") Quite  
the contrary! The typos, missing  
words and punctuation “errors” are  
there for a reason.

MUNDANE'S WORLD is hardly  
dashed off - Grahn took 15 years  
writing it, and she knows what  
she's doing. What is she doing?  
Demanding a good deal of trust from  
the reader, and in return teaching  
psychic agility.
