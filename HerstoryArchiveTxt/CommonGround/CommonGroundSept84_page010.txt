STOP HLA TASK FORCE is a letter-writing  
group which seeks to educate and lobby  
our elected officials about legislation  
concerning the reproductive rights of  
girls and women. It was established  
three years ago in response to the  
threat of a Constitutional Amendment  
(the Human Life Amendment) which would  
have established that human life  
begins at conception, therefore out-  
lawing abortion and certain types of  
birth control. The focus has broad-  
ened to include any and all federal,  
state and local rules and regulations  
that would restrict a woman's choice  
of a safe, legal abortion, including  
Medicaid funding for abortions. They  
have written hundreds of letters in  
support of family planning programs,  
sex education programs, and against  
cutbacks in Medicaid funding for abor-  
tions as well as proposed legislation  
restricting or prohibiting access to  
safe, legal abortions.

Meetings are twice a month, from  
September to May or June, either the  
first and third or second and fourth  
Mondays of the month, depending on  
scheduled holidays. For more infor-  
mation, call Paulette Hammond at  
631-3967 (between 5-6:30 p.m. is  
best) or Gail Willsby, 831-2969  
(8:30-5 p.m.).

and 24th at 210 Franklin Street,  
fourth floor library from 7-9 p.m.

BUFFALO N.O.W.'s first meeting of  

the year will take place Wednesday,  
September 19 at 7:30 p.m. at the  
North Buffalo Community Center.

The movie Women's Voices: The Gender  
Gap will be shown. This movie inter-  
weaves three elements. In persuasive  
interviews about issues that have  
been an intimate part of their lives,  
we hear from a suburban housewife,  
senior citizen, high school student,  
a dairy farmer, blue-collar workers,  
and the former co-chair of the Repub-  
lican National Committee. The Gender  
Gap movie offers startling statistics,  
both about these issues and the size  
of the gender gap. In her movie  
debut, Nicole Hollander’s nationally  
syndicated cartoon character "Sylvia"  
appears in full-color animation.

The film will be followed by a panel  
discussion.

ERIE COUNTY N.O.W. will show the  
movie Women's Voices: The Gender Gap  
on Tuesday, September 18th at 7:30  
p.m. at the Unitarian Church, 6320  
Main Street, Williamsville.
