The most difficult test any wo-
man faces during her lifetime is
being alone. How she handles it
will determine her behavior in fu-
ture relationships. If she can't
stand her own company, a woman will
cling to dead-end relationships un-
til she's bitter enough to star in
a remake of “Who's Afraid of Vir-
ginia Woolf." But the woman who
can tolerate and even enjoy her
time alone will cultivate the mi-
raculous power of making gliding,
graceful exits from intolerable

love affairs.

Financially, women have extricated
themselves from men. (That was the
easy part). They know they can
support themselves. But emotion-
ally, women are still dependent on
males. Only in this area do women
still feel they just can’t make it
without "him." They believe deep
down in their hearts that there is
no such thing as “independence.”
It's just a nice word for being a-
lone because nobody wants you.

Today's books and magazine
articles don't help. They constant-
ly emphasize the pitfalls and pin-
nacles of coupledom: sex, romance,
getting together, being together,
staying together. When they do
discuss being alone, it's always
advice on how to temporarily dis-
tract yourself until another man
comes along.
(take long, perfumed baths; write letters; take more long, perfumed baths).

In the past, when relationships
ended, I would desperately search
under every barstool and Nautilus

machine for a replacement. Can you
blame me? My other option was being
alone. Yuck. It might as well have
been a prison sentence of solitary
confinement. Of course, I never
realized this dependency on men,
which stemmed from my fear of being
alone. But for what other reason
would I date big-time losers or
stay in relationships that were go-
ing straight to hell? Secretly, I
dreaded the thought of keeping my
own company. What would I do with
myself? Who would I do things with?
I was seriously concerned about dy-
ing from boredom. Personality
wasn't worth having, jokes weren't
worth making without a man to witness
and acknowledge my every move.

Last year, I found myself alone
when my boyfriend of three years
dropped me like a bomb for another
woman. I had to face not only the
“prison term" of being alone, but
also the rejection that, if left
unchecked, threatened to lower my
self-esteem.

At first, I slid into my old,
familiar breakup ritual. From
about five feet across the room, I
swan-dived onto my living room
couch, curled up into a fetal ball,
and tortured myself by conjuring
up images of my ex-boyfriend with
the finalists of the Miss U.S.A.
pageant, or with the Channel 5
anchorwoman, or with the model on
the cover of Cosmo. My body
flinched, jerked, cringed with
every knife I struck into it. I
was feverish, withering, dying.

How could God be so cruel?
Mercifully providing that villain
with an easy, instant replacement,
while he left me to suffer --
alone, lonely, not even a damn
friend (and worse, boyfriend) in
the whole stinking world.

By the third day of this rou-
tine, I actually grew sick of it—
sick of feeling rotten. My sur-
vival instincts took over. It was
time to check out of the Heartbreak
Hotel. Although the thought of
facing life alone did not thrill me,
I simply had no other choice but to
grin and bear it.

The whole ugly incident threw me
into the coldest and hardest of re-
alities: you can't, you absolutely
can't rely on a man for your happi-
ness. This is the fatal mistake.
And although I had paid cheap lip
service to this advice many times
in the past, I now believed it
with the faith of a Born Again
Christian reading the Sermon on
the Mount.

In this honest frame of mind,
I realized how much I had used men
as substitutes for accomplishing
my goals. They served as a dis-
traction from the frightening task
of developing my potential. That
was part of the reason being alone
was so painful. Solitude forced
me to look deep inside myself and
discover: "...oh, oh, something is
missing here..."

It was so much easier to ride
the coattails of a man on his way
to fame, fortune or enlightenment.
Then I wouldn't have to worry about
rejection, failure, success, any-
thing that is overpowering or hard
to handle emotionally. I was in
neutral, waiting for a man to take
over the wheel and drive around the
sharp, scary turns.

But now it was time to take con-
trol, to do something for my own
satisfaction instead of everyone
else's. I decided to start writing
again. Years earlier I had had a
few articles published in local
newspapers. The success had been
terrifying enough to throw me into
a deep freeze, because that's about
the time I started my holy search
for the perfect mate. It was as
futile as Ponce De Leon's quest for
the Fountain of Youth. But at least
De Leon stumbled on Florida in the
course of his search. The only
thing I fell into was a rut.

I wrote and wrote until finally
(and I do mean finally), my arti-
cles started getting published.

And although I'm a long way from
winning the Pulitzer or having my
mug plastered all over the cover
of PEOPLE magazine, I'm using a
talent instead of wasting it;
growing inside instead of withering.

But the irony of it all is that
I never would have begun accom-
plishing without being alone. It
wasn’t a prison term after all, but
a great escape from the fears that
were holding me back.
And the next time around, I will
have the sense to stay in a good
relationship and the strength to
leave a bad one. While love is
undeniably wonderful, being alone
can be nourishing to the soul. It
throws you face to face with the
person you're most afraid of:
yourself. And that's not so bad -
if you can become friends.

MOHAWK TRAIL, FROM PAGE 4
received a plaque one year from 
her boss, proclaiming her speed 
at typing. Someone had painted 
a picture of an Indian in head- 
dress typing furiously. Laura 
was supposed to laugh but she 
didn't. “She quit instead.” 
(Pg. 20) 
“Daddy went to school for years. 
He eventually became a quiet 
teacher. He loved his work. His 
ambition, his dream, was to teach 
on a reservation...Daddy had one 
suit to teach in. When he wore 
his beaded necklace, some of the 
students laughed. His retirement 
came earlier than expected. The 
white boys in his Indian History 
class beat him up as they chanted, 
‘Injun Joe, Injun Joe'". (Pg. 21)

Hearing voices. Making voices
heard. Making it possible for us
all to hear them.

The middle section of Brant's book,
“Detroit Songs,” is a collection of
monologues in an amazing variety of
voices. Brant is a virtuoso on the
human spirit. Her voices range from
that of "Daddy", who gives blood for
an Indian friend in the morning and
then spends his 12-hour day at a day-
labor, one-day job in the salt mines -

“The white woman who took the
blood, she said I should relax
and take it easy. But those days,
you couldn't afford to relax. It
was every minute you thought about
a job, about feeding your family.
Sometimes the bags broke, and the
salt came spilling out on us. The
boss yelled and yelled, making us
sweep it up and put it back in the
bags. Some of us, we laughed at
him. I remember, his face was so
red, and he worried more about
salt than he did about us. But
see, that was his job, eh? That's
the way it was in those days.
And it’s still like that, I
never knew anybody a union didn't
help." (Pg 39-40)

-- to the voice of Garnet Lee, an
auto worker and the support of her
aged mother:

"I worked side by side a colored
man for 15 years...I say, if you
work with a person long enough,
you're just a plain fool if you
can't see you're in it together.
Working people's lives is hard
times. You got to stick to each
other. It's like being in a family.
Lord knows, families can be a pain
in the you-know-what, but nothin’
ain't easy. Yes, working people
got to stick to each other. Lord
knows, the company ain't going
to!” (Pg. 46-47)

The voice that touches me the deep-
est is Danny's:

“I was a pretty kid. Wanted to
be like my ma. Wanted to be a
girl. Sean teased me a lot, called
me ‘sissy.’ But Joey stood up for
me. Man, I loved Joey so much...
He was strong and good in sports.
But he had this sweet side to him.
He used to cry when Dad got on my
case about something..." (Pg. 57)

Danny's "working-class dream" is
to be a nurse. He's the only man
in the program, but that's okay,
because he likes being with women.
Finally, he makes it:

WHY IS IT

WHY ARE WOMEN WHO
ARE IRONIC CALLED

The final section, "Long Stories,”
begins with a monologue by a young
wife and mother in the mental ward
of the county hospital:

“I am given Thorazine in a tiny
pleated paper cup...I make my
first mistake by asking what it
is that I am swallowing. Pencil
eyebrows rising into brown bangs,
the nurse tells me it will calm
me down. But I am already calm.

I walked here myself, my husband
holding my arm. Why I am here
has something to do with losing
myself. I used to be there --
a young wife and mother in my
house -- washing dishes, bleach-
ing diapers, reading a book,
watching TV. Then I lost me.”

(Pg. 69)

How she finds herself, her source of
wellness, is a lesson to the mental-
health profession (I have a hard time
not putting that phrase in quotes) —
if it will only hear.

In perhaps the most powerful piece
in the book, "A Long Story," Brant
relates the present-day stealing of
children from lesbian mothers to the
1890's theft of an Indian woman's
children, introduced by a quotation
from The Northern Observer of Massena,
N.Y., from 1892: "About 40 Indian
children took the train at this depot
for the Philadelphia Indian School
last Friday. They were accompanied
by the government agent, and seemed
a bright looking lot." (Pg. 77) My
face burned as I read. Never mind
that I'm a feminist, a sometime—
activist, a chronicler of pain and
strength. Never mind that in that
same year, my forbears were fleeing
Cossack persecution in Poland and
Lithuania. I'm still a white woman,
a privileged woman. My learned
intelligence and skills keep me at home
in the world of words, the world
where some people -- some peoples —
are raped and others feed on their
bones.

My own criticism of Mohawk Trail
is that it's such a small book. We
need more from Beth Brant, more from
other Indian women, more from voices
like hers -- and different. That's
why I urge you to buy this book, or
if you can't buy it, to read it and
talk about it. If Mohawk Trail sells
fantastically well, Firebrand Books
will have the resources to publish
more voices, and Brant will be
heartened and keep working.

I hope this voice will be heard
for years to come.
