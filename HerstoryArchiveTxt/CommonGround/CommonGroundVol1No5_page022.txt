BUFFALO:
BIG TOWN FOR SMALL PRESSES

* From Page 6

Beginners. In 1947, the authors of The
Little Magazine estimated that 600
little magazines were published be-
tween 1912 and 1946; only eight still
exist. In the single year of 1977,
the CCLM listed over 600, while Anania
estimated that in the whole country
over 1500 magazines were publishing,
more than two-thirds of which were
started after 1970, part of an explo-
sion of small presses that began in...
the late '60s and appears to still be
going strong.

This explosion is attributed by
Anania to a number of factors. First is
a growing population of writers (who,
we have seen, become both publishers
and readers of small press publica-
tions). In fact, Anania says, in all
seriousness, that today, "for the
first time in history, we may have
more writers than readers." Second
is the technological revolution which
has made the means for reproduction —
ditto, mimeo, xerox and photo-offset
more accessible to more people, and
also cheaper. Older, hand-set letter-
press machines are still sometimes
used by small presses, but are usually
reserved for special projects where a
more artful reproduction is desired.
Letterpress printing appears now to be
considered a kind of art form in and
of itself. Third is the availabili-
ty of grants from the NEA, CCLM, as
well as state and local arts councils.

To these three factors, we would
like to add a hypothetical fourth -
the rise of the women's movement. If
what has happened in Buffalo is typi-
cal of what has happened in the
country as a whole, then many presses
have sprung up, some avowedly femin-
ist, the majority run by women, but al-
most all giving a good portion of
their space to women's voices. The
significance of this may perhaps be
measured by the fact that, at a
Conference of Small Press Publishers
and Editors (COSMEP) held in Buffalo
in 1970, only 2 out of 150 people
were women. If that same conference
were held in 1982, the percentage
might be reversed!

Next month's article will discuss some
of the individual small presses in the
Western New York area.
