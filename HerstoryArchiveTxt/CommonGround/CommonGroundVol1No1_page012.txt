CG: Who founded Planned Parenthood?  
JO: Margaret Sanger, on a trip to Buf-  
falo in the 1920s, talked to some in-  
fluential people from the area. Several  
women were responsible for the Family  
Relations Institute. This institute  
was set up for women to be able to get  
health information that was unavailable  
at the time.  

Margaret Sanger was a nurse in New  
York City in the tenements and she  
watched women die of self-abuse and  
abortions. She believed information  
should be accessible to women.  

A child has a right to be healthy,  
wanted and loved. Children are too  
important to be left to chance.  
CG: How would a Spanish-speaking woman  
reach you?  
Sue Olesky: Through community agencies,  
organizations and volunteer groups,  
Church, Y.W.C.A.  

CG: Are there translators available?  
SUE: Yes, translators are available  
through different various community and  
Church groups.  
CG: Why do you feel that this organiza-  
tion is important?  
JO: Women should be able to control  
what happens to their bodies. We be-  
lieve in a woman's right to choose. The  
benefits of family planning just are  
enormous. Healthy children, healthy  
mothers, opportunities for better lives  
for both of them, reduced infant and  
maternal death rates, economic benefits,  
mental and physical health benefits, etc.  
We have a sliding fee scale and con-  
fidential services. Anyone with further  
questions please call:

Gail King: Disability is Also a Challenge  
by Marilyn Patterson  

Twelve years ago, Buffalo feminist Gail King worked as a nurse's aide in a Boston, Mass., hospital.  

She had been noticing a heaviness in her legs, but nurse's aides are on their feet all day. Once she bent down to tie slippers on a woman and couldn't get up, so she grabbed the side of a washbasin to pull herself up. She made a mental note to get a new pair of support hose.  

Soon afterwards her doctor told her the hosiery was not to blame. In fact, her body was making its beginning response to her new life partner - multiple sclerosis.  

Commonly known as MS, multiple sclerosis is a disease of the nervous system that attacks the sheath covering the nerves. It leaves scars on the sheaths, rendering them incapable of transmitting messages from the brain.  

"If you think of it like two telephone poles," Gail explains, "one pole is the mind, the other is the functional part (of the body). They’re connected with wires. The problem is in the wires."  

It is called multiple because it produces multiple lesions on the brain and spinal cord and the damage appears in different parts of the body.  

The result is that the body deteriorates. In Gail's words, "I'm doing a fast job of what you are doing in the long run."  

She makes the point with an intent expression.  

She does mean you.  

Our meeting coincided with a television special on disabled Americans, who at 50 million, are the nation's largest minority. Gail smiled as the commentator reminded his audience that it is one minority for which everyone is eligible. An accident or a disease that disables can strike anyone, as Gail's experience points out.  

She grew up as a healthy child in the Boston area, attending public and parochial schools. After she graduated from Cardinal Cushing College in Brookline, Mass., she worked as a teacher for two years - long enough to discover that she didn't like it.  

So she went back to the kind of work she had done and enjoyed before her teaching days - working as a nurse's aide.  

She was in her early twenties and it was a time of great political activity. Gail was a member of Cell 16 and Female Liberation, two of the Boston area's earliest organizations in this wave of feminism.  

In the 1960s, she was also involved in the Daughters of Bilitis, an organization for lesbians.  

Gail came out as a lesbian during her sophomore year of college. That was her first relationship with a woman, "I fell in love with an upperclassman who was engaged. For her it was just a sexual experience, but for me I knew it was more."  

She didn't find DOB until several years later when the group was pioneering in the area of speaking for the political and civil rights for lesbians. Later, Gail worked as a therapist in the Homophile Community Health Service in Boston.  

Gail was 25 when she was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis.  

Things began to change more quickly than she had expected. She had planned a summer vacation in Jerusalem and decided to go, despite her doctor's warning that hot climates exacerbate the disease. "I got there and I felt weak and passive. I had no energy. I had to come home."  

Since then things have changed a lot. She began walking with a cane because her legs had grown weaker. Soon she was using ordinary crutches and then crutches with arm braces. Two years ago, Gail noted how much weaker her legs were getting and decided to move to a wheelchair. Again it was a move her doctor opposed, this time because restricting her mobility could accelerate the disease.  

"But I was tired of falling," Gail said. "I was very aware of how tired I was getting."  

Gail says now her doctor was right, the disease did accelerate after she moved to a wheelchair, but if she had it to do over again, she'd make the same choice.  

Now, at age 37, Gail spends much of her time lying down because her circulation is bad and she has difficulty sitting, even in the wheelchair, for long periods of time. She no longer has control of her bladder and has difficulty controlling her bowels.  

The corneas in her eyes spasm and she cannot read.  

She stopped working about four years ago and is on Supplemental Security Income (SSI) and Medicaid. The In-Home Health Service of Erie County provides her with nursing care for all but about four hours every day.  

"I'm doing a fast job of what you are doing in the long run."  

The opportunity that has come out of Gail's adversity is the opportunity for a new kind of confrontation.  

"I've had to confront much sooner issues that I have never confronted before - God and soul."  

"I always thought of confrontation only in political terms. Political confrontation is easy for me. Soul confrontation is hard stuff."  

In Gail's view, she confronts not only her own soul but the souls of others too.  

"By my being, I am confronting my brothers and sisters with what life is all about. I'm not used to being a question mark like that, but you have to settle something in yourself. You have to realize you're worth something."  

What message does she have for those
