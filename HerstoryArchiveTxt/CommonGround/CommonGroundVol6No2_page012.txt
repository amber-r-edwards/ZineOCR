I was looking at to where Hansen

spoke. She had us through the house
faster than I would have believed
possible. I do not think we proba-

bly missed much, only speeded up our
perceptual processes and ran back and
forth. The one thing I did miss see-
ing was Cather's copy of We Boys, which
was on the artifacts list and which I
asked to see. The living room was
roped off; and although she walked

that far, Hansen did not go through

the bookcase. I didn't mind -- she
was a fine guide and answered questions
well.

Built in 1879, kept up by the Ne-
braska State Historical Society and
designated a national monument under
the auspices of the National Park Ser-
vice, the little house stood in Cather's
time five blocks from “Quality Knob,"
the “better” part of town -- I suppose
emphasizing her father's status as an
insurance and farm loan man. (Charles
Cather had retired from sheep ranch-
ing and farming better to support his
family.) I found the house a marvel
of organization, one room fitting
neatly into another, saving overall
floor space. Cather's much-loved ma-
ternal grandmother Rachel Elizabeth
Siebert Boak had a such a slit
between the dining room and kitchen;
it may originally have been a pantry.
I liked the room's tiny scale and ac-
cessibility. Pots of single gerani-
ums and of English ivy tucked into
window sills reinforced my sense of
everything in its place. (In summer
geraniums probably were set into the
earth outside.) This neatness may
have helped relieve the effects of
living in a small enclosed space with
up to nine people and sometimes even
two paying customers for lunch. My
impression was furthered by Cather's
tidy shell collection, kept adjacent
to a grey painted washstand in her
room. Mildred Bennet, Cather's Red
Cloud biographer, tells us also that
Mary Virginia Boak Cather, the novel-
ist's mother, was a very orderly per-
son. From the folded huck towels in
Grandma Boak's room to a jar of
spiced cantaloupe dating back to
Cather's day, this was a house to be
reckoned with!

Outside, the preciseness and
prettiness of the small white
house continued in the fret-
work framing the porch and
scalloped white picket fence
framing the yard. A red bucket
hung from the pump on a porch
outside the kitchen door. (Inside
the door, flowered napkins edged
with tatting and lavender sprigged
luncheon plates of German china,
probably Meissen, lay ready, as
they had, on the lid of a barrel
used for a laundry hamper.) Bor-
dered by a neat brick walk, vel-
vety brown-eyed Susans, a lamb's
ear plant and purple opal sage
grow along the South side of the
house. Downstairs at the histori-
cal center, a glass case displays
favorites of Cather's: Aunt Frank
(for Frances) Cather's botany,

the Clemens botany (the book Willa
Cather most wished she had written),
and Edith S. Clements Flowers of the

continued. Just how powerful these
characteristics of her childhood home
were to Cather's work seems to me part-
ly indicated by what Sister Lucy
Schneider, C.S.J., has written in

the Kansas Quarterly (Winter 1968)
about Cather's "gravitational" at-
traction to life and art. However it
may have irritated, Cather's family
home suggests one characteristic
source of this attraction.

Walking back to the historical
center I felt disjointed, torn be-
tween the late nineteenth century
setting of the house on a slant
and, e.g., the beige brick and con-
crete U.S.P.O. of modern design,
the national bird depicted in white
wrought iron over its front door.

The food was free. Some of the town's
menfolk had cooked the delicious well-
peppered beef all night over fire in
open pits. Probably every electric
roaster oven and canning sterilizer
in town was filled with baked beans.
Some of the weathered people we saw
looked as if they might step right
into a Cather novel. Whether set in
Black Hawk, Frankfort, Hanover, Hav-
erford, Moonstone or Sweetwater, it
was the same -- Red Cloud. And, like
Cather and her grandmother's white
ironstone coffee pot, Red Cloud has
a certain plain elegance to go on.

In fact, Red Cloud was so compel-
ling that after starting to leave,
we could not. Instead, we located
ourselves with a country tour pam-
phlet. Sure enough, we had just
passed over Crooked Creek, said to
have been one of Cather's "favorite
playgrounds." Following our best
instincts, we turned back and sought
out near the Kansas border the 610
acre Memorial Prairie set aside in
Cather's honor by The Nature Con-
servancy. And, it was as she wrote
in My Antonia (1918): "The grass was
the country, as the water is the sea...
and there was so much motion in it,
the whole country seemed somehow, to
be running." It was sundown. The quiet
of the prairie was compelling. I sat
on the concrete base of the historical
marker breathing in alfalfa scented
air, watching butterflies of several
descriptions catch the wind that
howled incessantly. Never had I seen
so many different grasses and wild
flowers growing in such profusion.
Willie with her unfashionably short
hair was something of an outcast in
smug Red Cloud society of her day --
on these 610 acres harmony with her
environment is found.
