Pro-Choice  

By E.R. Mann  
BUFFALO, N.Y. - Pro-Choice  
Activists have secured a victory in  
their fight to have Anti-Choice  
protestors arrested when they block  
the entrances to Buffalo abortion  
clinics and doctors' offices.  

The Pro-Choice Network achieved  

this victory by staging a protest  
of their own -- outside the Buffalo  
Police Headquarters Saturday Nov-  
ember 12th. They were protesting  
the slow and inefficient handling  
of illegal demonstrators who blocked  
public access to an Elmwood Avenue  
abortion clinic on October 28-29.  
Despite the clearly illegal nature  

of the anti-choice blockade, the  
police refused to take action unless  
the clinic's director, Marilynn  
Buckham, went down to the police  
station and officially signed a  
complaint. Ms. Buckham repeatedly  
called police from inside the clinic  
requesting them to clear the en-  
trance, and despite the repeated  
requests from those outside the  
clinic for access, the police  
refused to clear the way. The  
clinic director, Ms. Buckham was  
for a time, unable to leave the  
clinic to sign an official request  
because the blockaders trapped her  
inside the building. There are  
reports that Ms. Buckham resorted  
to climbing out a window in order  
to comply with the police request.  

The antics of the police, which  
in effect cooperated with an illegal  
anti-choice blockade, enraged many  
local pro-choice workers, who called  
for a counter-demonstration outside  
police headquarters. One organizer  
said the rationale for targeting the  
police station was to educate the  
police on the difference between a  
legal and illegal demonstration:  

"If the Buffalo police department is  
so poorly trained that they had to  
go to court for a judge to tell them  
how to respond to an illegal block-  
ade, I don't think that speaks very  
well of the local police."  

Many pro-choice workers felt that  
it was also possible that Buffalo's  
Mayor, James Griffin, may have had  
something to do with the slow police  
response: "It's his style to be a  
little heavy-handed with groups he  
doesn't like."  
When the Pro-Choice Network called  
for their counter-demonstration at  
the police headquarters, they claim  
they didn't expect anything like the  
150 or so pro-choice demonstrators,  

said another activist.

"It's very encouraging,” said a  
spokesperson, "there's a lot more  
pro-choice energy out there than  
people realize. All the people there  
were local men and women. Maybe  
marches are ‘old hat', but we still  
may have the capacity to do it [when  
the issue is important enough]."  

Several of the demonstrators said  
they went because they realized that  
they had to personally show support  
for public access to abortion  
clinics, as well as personally show  
their distaste for the way the police  
acted. "Besides, this is fun, it's  
energizing and important. I'd  
never dreamed of being in a demon-  
stration before, but this one I had  
to go to."  

A pro-choice spokesperson said the  
counter-demonstration was “a solid  
success" when she was informed that  
the police did make timely and organ-  
ized arrests outside the Linwood Ave-  
nue clinic. This time, the police

showed up early in the day of the  
"Rescue", with sufficient numbers  
of police (and a few waiting buses)  
to clear the way for persons wishing  
to enter the Linwood clinic.  
Pro-choice activists will be set-  
ting up "watch-dog" committees to  
monitor anti-choice activities (and  
police response) and to plan other  
activities. The issue clearly revolves  
around a woman's right to control  
her body, and the efforts to take  
that control away, for these acti-  
vists. One said: “The life and death  
issue is about real, flesh, blood and  
bone women. I think the ‘silent  
majority’ is going to resurface again  
and reclaim what has been lost be-  
neath a lot of conservative rhetor-  
ic."
