which, unfortunately, only the af-
firmative action one was included in
the platform.

Locally, we are involved in voter
registration as part of the area
Women's Vote Project, and raising
money for our National PAC. The
money will go to support feminist
candidates throughout the country,
especially women candidates who for
too long have been denied their fair
share of party funding.

Since 1981,

Kate Clinton has been

on a roll. Packed audiences from coast
to coast and everywhere in between

have been on a roll with her--gen-
erally in the aisles. She has played
comedy clubs, colleges, coffeehouses,
and conferences, and that's just the
c's. Her style of stand-up comedy

has been called "courageous", "ener-
gized", "brilliant" and "gutsy". A
trendsetter, she is the first comedian

ever to appear with a back-up group,
"Kate Clinton and the Vessels of
Sin". Their finale, a religious num-
ber (no, not 3), is already a page

in the history of comedy!

A classically trained stand-up
comedian, this joker/jokewriter com-
poses and arranges all her own mater-
ial, drawing from her deep roots as
a white, middle-class, former high
school English teacher and Recovering
Catholic. Kate calls herself a
fumerist--that's feminist and humor-
ist combined. Her repertoire re-
flects her twin convictions that
women are oppressed and that it must
end. Unlike men's humor which is
based on the maintenance of the status
quo, feminist humor is based on a
vision of change. Kate believes
that our sense of humor is proof of
our sense of survival. Laughing to-
gether, we are women bonding together
through shared experience and through
common opposition to our oppression.

Her first comedy album, Kate
Clinton: Making Light! (WhysCrack
Records), is no LP for vegetarians.
Kate eats sacred cows. The amazing
success of that record indicates an
audience hungry for Kate's irreverent
wit. What Kate serves us in her
second comedy album, Making Waves,
ain't exactly chopped liver and ful-
fills her first record's promise of

Emma is...

The EMMA Collective spent a week
in August in renovation and painting
of our storefront at 168 Elmwood.
We are now open for business with a
new face lift! Thank you to all
the women in the community who
donated their time and supplies.

Upcoming arrivals include a
varied selection of the works of
Adrienne Rich, Audre Lorde and
May Sarton, some old and some
brand new. A selection of crafts
direct from the Michigan Women's
Music Festival is on display.

Holly Near's newest album, Watch
Out! is available, as well as
Kate Clinton's latest release,
Making Waves.

EMMA is pleased to sponsor Kate's
upcoming concert September 15th
at the Church of the Ascension
(see complete information elsewhere
in this issue) and we're looking
forward to a very entertaining
evening with this innovative fem-

much more. Once again, this truly
New Wave comedian gleefully eviscer-
ates the institutions which oppress
us, while celebrating the women's
culture which unites us. And clearly,
the endless title possibilities for
subsequent records--Making Dinner,
Making Sense, Making Love--guarantee
that Kate will be around for a long
time.

Since Kate believes that, as a
fumerist, her work is toward an end
to the oppression of women, chances
are she will be around for a while.
In a world where the reverse abides
(where, for example, men who tell
jokes about women are funny; but
women who tell jokes about men are
anti-male) Kate encourages women to
use the old double reverse. To take
warning as welcomes and insults as
invitations. Women have always been
warned not to make light, generally
when we are getting dangerously close
to seeing something. Kate encourages
women to make light--light enough to
see in our dark times, light enough
to make women visible to each other.
Women have always been warned not
to make waves. Kate teaches women
the existential cannonball, the belly-
smacker, and dives of even greater
difficulty--whatever it takes to
turn the tide.
