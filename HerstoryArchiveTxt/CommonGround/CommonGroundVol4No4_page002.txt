‘“churching’

by Regina Kociecki

Just about everyone agrees that
in modern life changes are "fast and
furious." Pressures are made on
schools, marriages, businesses and
religions to accommodate and modify
to our new perceptions. Liturgies,
with their elements of tradition,
ceremony, symbolism and mystery, are
being examined for relevance by both
individuals and churches. Both may
be unaware that they are simultane-
ously asking, "Why are we still doing
such-and-such? Should we continue it?"
It's all to the good, I believe, es-
pecially in our religious practices
because faith is a source of strength
and a vital force in our daily lives
and customs that offend, are unclear,
or have lost their connection, should
be swept out and away. Take, for ex-
ample, the old custom of "churching"
in my church, the Roman Catholic.

Shortly after my first child was
born, some 36 years ago, my mother
asked when (not if) I was going to
arrange for the "Wywod." The modern
Polish dictionary defines it as de-
duction, argumentation, adduction.
Clearly, it had another meaning to my
mother.

"What's a 'Wywod'?" I asked.

It's the custom, she explained,
where after the birth of a child and
before the baptism, the mother goes
to the back of the church, the priest
greets her there with a lighted can-
dle, and escorts her to the front of
the church for blessing and cleansing,
and thereafter she is once again a
full participating member of the
Church.

I'm sure I never heard the word
"blessing," only the "cleansing."

"Cleansing? Does the husband go,
too?"

"No, only the mother and child,
if he is well." In those days the
child was rarely taken out of the
home lest he become ill before bap-
tism, which then, as now, was arran-
ged within the month whenever possi-
ble.

I bristled. (In those days I

bristled easily, and often). "Well,
I'm not going. I haven't done any-
thing wrong -- just what the Church

commanded married people to do. And
furthermore, why should the mother
and not the father be cleansed?"

My poor mother, not the most
articulate of souls anyway, knew
better than to argue with intem-
perate youth. Most likely her own
mother had not given her a clearer
explanation.

I did not think of this custom
till some eight years later, at the
birth of my third child, a daughter.
During a visit to the maternity ward
by the Catholic chaplain, one of the
young women in the 4-bed ward asked
if he could arrange for the "church-
ing." “My mother will not let me

WOMEN&
CHURCHES

By Virginia Power

The Task Force on Women and the
Churches is almost three years old
and we define ourselves as "an ecu-
menical group of women who have come
together to focus attention on the
roles and concerns of women within
the church structure in Western New
York."

The Task Force, like many other
feminist organizations, was born out
of a combination of frustration and
faith; frustration at the lack of
response by the institutional church
to the concerns of women, and faith
in ourselves and in our God.

Those behind the idea were a small
group of Roman Catholic laywomen.
Each of us was experienced in social

justice work and we were all feminists.
Our initial meeting, which was held at

the Center for Justice on Main Street

in Buffalo, was attended by six women,

three who were members of religious
communities and staff people at the
Center, and three laywomen. At this

meeting, we explored how we might work

together to reach out to other women
and discussed ways to begin to sen-
sitize men in the local institutional
church to women's issues.

The choice of the Center for Jus-

tice as our home was a deliberate one.

The Center is owned, staffed and sup-
ported by several Roman Catholic com-
munities of religious women and has
existed for over ten years. During
that time, Center staff members have
worked in every area of social jus-
tice, including women's issues. The
decision to combine our efforts en-
abled members of religious communi-
ties and laywomen who share the vi-
sion of equality for women in the
Church, to work together to help
bring it about.

Although church feminist groups
exist throughout the United States
and in many other countries as well,
the Task Force on Women and the
Churches is an independent, local or-
ganization. Because of our indepen-
dence, we are free to find our own
way and in doing so, have begun to
travel a path not taken by most other
church feminist groups at the present
time.

Our most significant departure
from the directions of other groups
is that we became ecumenical shortly
after our formation. Our present
mailing list includes names of Pro-
testant and Catholic laywomen, Pro-
testant ordained clergywomen and
members of Roman Catholic religious
communities. Our membership con-
sists of women living all over
Western New York, from Batavia to
Olean and Jamestown, through the
metropolitan Buffalo area and into
Niagara Falls and Lewiston. While
we may differ in background, ex-

Editor's Note: Happy Holidays!!
This month we bring you a collec-
tion of articles and essays from wo-
men about their relationships to re-
ligion, or particular insights they
have gained about themselves and
their spiritual upbringing.
Religion, especially in the late
1980s, is a hotly debated issue
within and without the ecclesiasti-

cal hierarchies, Houses of Congress,
School Boards, board rooms and li-

ving rooms. CG's scope, naturally, -
is smaller and by no means defini-
tive. Here are a few individuals'
thoughts which we hope will stimu-
late our readers to examine the
global and personal place religion,
and religions have,

perience and education, we are uni-
ted in our desire to see ourselves
recognized by our churches.

The decision to link across de-
nominational lines has had one very
important result: the acute aware-
ness by members of the Task Force
that the oppression of women is not
confined to any single denomination;
they are all guilty to some extent.
This knowledge has enabled us to
achieve a more realistic understand-
ing of the struggles we face in our
efforts to effect change in the in-
stitutional churches.

Christian feminists, like women
working in other areas of the women's
movement, are attempting to change a
culture and institution which has
existed for centuries. Because of
the magnitude and complexity of this
challenge, accomplishments are dif-
ficult but, they do occur. For
example, we know of clergymen who
have become sensitized to sexist
language through our efforts. We
are also aware of others who have
recognized their patronizing, con-
descending manner toward women and
are trying to develop new ways of
relating.

However, the most important ac-
complishment of the Task Force has
been the validation of the feelings
of women. Over and over women tell
us, “I thought I was the only one
who felt this way." Women discover
their frustrations and anger are
shared by others. They learn in
study groups, from conference
speakers as well as interacting
with one another, that the problem
is not them, but rather the atti-
tude of the institutional churches
toward women.

The Task Force is composed of
women at all stages of awareness
and development and our activities
reflect that diversity. Day-long
