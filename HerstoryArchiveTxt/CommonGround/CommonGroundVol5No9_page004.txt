AWARD OF EXCELLENCE  
EVERYWOMAN OPPORTUNITY CENTER  

Judge Ann T. Mikoll, Edith B.  
Robinson and Lynne S. Vallone  
are the 1986 recipients of the  
Everywoman Opportunity Center  
Award of Excellence.  

Judge Mikoll, who sits as an  
associate justice on New York  
State's Supreme Court, is cited  
for her advocacy of women's  
rights during her 28 years on  
the bench.  

Mrs. Robinson, who is the re-  
tired Erie County Deputy Commis-  
sioner of the Department of Social  
Services, is also currently Vice-  
Chair of the local Red Cross and  
President of the W.N.Y. American  
Lung Association. She is also  
Registration Chair for the upcom-  
ing Conference on Volunteerism.  

Ms. Vallone is founder of the  
Coalition of Women for Child Sup-  
port, and serves on the Child  
Find Advisory Board, Domestic Vio-  
lence Coalition and National Asso-  
ciation of Social Workers Commit-  
tee.  

These women are being recogni-  
zed for their substantial contribu-  
tions to the quality of women's  
lives through their hard work and  
their demonstrated excellence in  
their fields.  

MORE CHILDREN COST MORE MONEY  

A study of 15 cities by Popula-  
tion and Environmental Balance, a  
Washington think tank, shows that,  
contrary to the belief of some  
experts, women actually fall deep-  
er into poverty with each addi-  
tional child and they make up  
the fastest growing segment of  
the poor. The report also states  
that each extra child puts a  
family an additional $517 below  
the poverty level, with the amount  
varying between about $400 in the  
West and $600 in the South.  

ASK FOR ALIMONY, NOT CHILD SUPPORT  

Taxwise, it is more advantageous  
to pay a sufficient amount of ali-  
mony to include child support  
than to separate the payments.  
Alimony payments are deductible  
from the paying spouse's gross  
income. The couple must also be  
living apart under a separation  
agreement, if not divorced, and  
file separate tax returns. Child  
support payments are not deducti-  
ble by the parent making such pay-  
ments, nor are they taxable to  
the recipient. If a divorce de-  
cree does not mention the portion  
of payments for child support,  
the entire payment will be con-  
sidered alimony.  

N.Y.S. ABORTION FUNDING  

It is spring budget time in  
Albany, and Sen. James H. Donovan  
(R-Chadwick) is again trying to  
delete appropriations for Medicaid  
abortions from the New York State  
budget.  

Federal government funds can  
currently only be used to save the  
life of the mother. New York is  
one of nine states that will fund  
other abortions for women who can-  
not pay that are considered "medi-  
cally necessary."  

In 1984 there were 44,200 abor-  
tions paid for by N.Y. State Medi-  
caid, the cost of which is shared  
by the state and counties. The  
price tag for this can run into  
the millions.  

Donovan complains that physi-  
cians have too great a leeway in  
determining what is "medically  
necessary" and that the state does  
not scrutinize physicians’ claims  
for reimbursement. The state says  
that abortions can be funded if  
they "were necessary to prevent,  
diagnose, correct or cure condi-  
tions...that cause acute suffering,  
endanger the life, result in ill-  
ness or infirmity, interfere with  
the capacity for normal activity  
or threaten some significant  
handicap..."  

Official State investigators  
however have never found an in-  
stance of an "elective" abortion  
being funded. Whether an abortion  
is necessary is clearly a medical  
judgment involving the physical,  
emotional and psychological needs  
of the woman. Women who get  
Medicaid abortions are frequently  
over or under ideal childbearing  
age, and have health problems which  
are exacerbated by pregnancy.  
Since these women are poor, their  
general health and nutrition is  
likely to be less than ideal also.  

PLANNING FOR RETIREMENT  

Since 70% of women 75 years  
of age and older are widowed it  
is becoming increasingly clear  
that women must plan for their  
own retirement and not rely on  
their husbands' arrangements.  
Retirement planning, once almost  
exclusively catering to men, has  
now become more aware of the  
needs of women. Rather than  
waiting until their 40's, 50's  
or 60's to think about retirement,  
many women, especially professional  
women in their 20's and 30's are  
starting IRAs, investments and  
doing other financial planning.

CHISHOLM TO TEACH COURSE IN BUFFALO  

The Honorable Shirley Chisholm,  
former congresswoman (D: NY), will  
teach a course, the politics and  
history of black women in the  
U.S. for the State University  
College at Buffalo summer school  
program, module B, June 30 to July  
19. The course will meet from 2  
to 4:30 pm. Co-listed by the  
political science and history  
departments, and providing either  
graduate or undergraduate credit,  
Mrs. Chisholm's course will be  
assisted by Sarah Slavin, assis-  
tant professor of political sci-  
ence, and Brenda Shelton, asso-  
ciate professor of history. This  
is a great opportunity to confront  
the dual burden of racism and  
sexism and to participate in a  
significant learning experience.  
The contributions and heritage of  
black women in the U.S. are too  
little known and nonetheless far-  
reaching in their implications  
for both our political system and  
our history.  

Manual registration for State  
University College summer school,  
for new and returning students,  
will take place on May 5 & 6,  
1 pm to 6 pm, in the Student Union  
Social Hall. Undergraduate numbers  
for the Chisholm course are PSC  
389 and HIS 300; graduate numbers  
are PSC 594 and HIS 594. Payment  
of tuition is due in full on day  
of registration. For further  
information, please contact the  
Registrar's Office, Grover Cleve-  
land Hall 204, (716) 878-4905.  

SIMONE DE BEAUVOIR  

Simone de Beauvoir, author of  
"The Second Sex" (1949) has died  
in Paris at age 78. de Beauvoir,  
who was a pioneering author and  
philosopher of feminist and so-  
cialist thought, is regarded as  
a founder of the modern day women's  
movement. "The Second Sex,"  
widely read and criticized, was  
a tour de force whose premise  
that women are treated as and  
accept for themselves the status  
of "second" or "other" in the  
world, formed a cornerstone of  
most modern feminist thought.
