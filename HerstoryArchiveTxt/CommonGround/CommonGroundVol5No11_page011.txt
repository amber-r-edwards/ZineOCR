Her eyes swept around the room, ex-
amining the impatient faces on the im-
patient people. Then she saw him and

the breath caught midway in her throat.

Her eyes fell to the floor, then rose
again in disbelief. She hadn't seen
him in two years and might have lived
the rest of her life without seeing
him. She turned so he couldn't see
her; she wasn't ready yet. She became
extremely interested in the dusty mud
on the side of her shoes. She had
meant to wipe it off this morning, but
forgot in the rush to leave the house.

For two years her favorite thoughts
had been centered on what she would do
if she saw him again. She imagined
herself regally ignoring him while he
begged for her attention. As she
thought she unconsciously turned and
held him captive with her eyes. Some-
one pushed against her. She looked
away and when she looked back he was
gone. He couldn't be gone, she cried
inside, not without seeing her, not
without her ignoring him. He was just
hidden for a moment among the specta-
tors. They'd heard of her plan and
were gathered to watch the grand per-
formance.

Her whole being strained desperately

to make him notice her. She must play
this indifferent role now or never
again. But he refused to notice her,
staring aimlessly out the windows.
Then she was marching toward him. He
still did not look at her. She was
forced to make this move. He forced
her.

"Hello," she squeaked stupidly and
immediately despised herself, for the
word and for her action.

Without surprise he smiled, obvi-

ously triumphant. He knew he'd won
and became quite smug. “I thought
you were dead."

She could think of no adequate re-
ply so she stood there.

"I'll call you,” he said simply
with an air of finality. He had dis-
missed her. She dared not speak, but
walked away.

She promised herself she would not
answer the phone. She pretended she
had planned it this better way. She
had intended to stay downtown, but in-
stead waited for the early bus. It
seemed she always waited for buses.
She hated them. She was always afraid
she would miss them and so she always
stood at the bus stop at least fifteen
minutes in advance of the scheduled
arrival time, and always, always she
clutched her fare in her hand for at
least an hour previous to that.

When she arrived home, she checked
the phone. She would not let this
chance slip by. She ran the water
for her bath, standing by the phone

FICTION:
It Was

It was late afternoon as the girl
made her way along a path leading to
the "Garden of St. Luke", a name for
a particular area of the cemetery.
Close-set trees grew high on both
sides of the path and Time had
braided their roots and branches.
Their outstretched limbs partially
protected her from something menacing
above, although she was not aware
of it. She kept her head down and
leaned into the wind that was fight-
ing her, trying to keep what was
there for itself. It had snowed
earlier in the day and as the girl
walked, her footprints left flaws
on the sculpted white ground. The
wind slowly began filling in these
stamped impressions painting an odd,
unfinished design behind her. The
gray clouds formed a pattern of
broken lines across the sky and the
air was heavy and bitter cold. She
breathed it in until she felt as
if she was pregnant with the death
around her. It was mid-winter so
there were snow drifts piled high
against the crooked horizontal rows
of tombstones, but only one or two
were totally covered. Occasionally,
when the sun shone through the clouds,
it was reflected by these icy, white
marble statues and they appeared, to
the girl, to be grinning at her. The
trees snapped in the wind as it whis-
tled through their frozen branches
and sounded the distant tune of some
Pied Piper whom she'd followed to
this place. She listened as he mock-
ingly played for her.

She had stopped walking and now
silently looked up. A few feet
ahead there was a small cross-shaped
monument. She started toward it
hesitantly; her movements were
cautious and disjointed. She was

while the tub filled, then quickly
ran through the thundering noise to
shut off the taps. She listened.
Nothing. She left the door open and
bathed. The water drained slowly
out. She took great pains in drying
herself, soaking up each water bead
individually. Nothing.

She dressed meticulously, every
detail must be considered, the make-
up fastidious, the hair perfection.
Nothing.

The doorbell startled her. She
peeked through the curtain. A boy
scout selling candy stood waiting.

She let him stand. She had a sign
which said "NO SALESMEN OR SOLICITORS"
and she'd meant to put it up. She
couldn't say no and felt stupid talking
to these people. She tiptoed quietly
into her room. If the boy scout heard
her she would have to say yes. She
lay down but didn't move. Nothing.
He must have meant he'd call tomorrow.
She slept, her head cocked in a pecu-
liar listening position. She dreamed
of her revenge. ©

Late Afternoon.

barely breathing as she knelt down
and gently brushed the snow from the
face of it. She moved her eyes to
read the name and began tracing it
with her finger; slowly; one letter
at a time. She went over it and

over it until her raw finger bled on
the rough concrete edges of the inden-
tations on the cross. She put them
in her mouth and then quickly took
them out again, watching them shake
uncontrollably. She put her wet hands
into her coat pocket and without
taking her eyes off the words she

had just traced, remained motionless
in front of that cross. She watched
the melting snow as it dripped from
each letter in the name and ran along
cracks in the stone. Why was she
there?

Her eyes stared straight ahead as
if penetrating the air that stung her
tear-streaked face. The girl pressed
her lips together. Was it just a
reflex against the cold or was she
trying to say something? Silent sobs
suddenly shook her body and she
choked on helpless screams. This
violent emotion lasted only a few
minutes, but then she stood still for
a long time just waiting, but not
feeling. When everything had gone
out of her, she lowered her eyes,
turned and began to follow the path
back out of the cemetery. And her
hands unconsciously became tight
fists in her pockets as she glared
skyward at the God she had so much
contempt for.
