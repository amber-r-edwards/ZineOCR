Women’s

Awards in Chautauqua County:

An Idea Whose Time Has Come

continued from page 1

had helped to organize an enormously
successful women's fundraising din-
ner.

A natural leader (in fact, she
was named in January 1980 by Ms.
Magazine as one of the 80 young women
to watch in the 1980s), JoAnne
brought a lucky infusion of enthu-
siasm and fresh energy to the some-
what tired Northern Chautauqua County
group. Before very long, the fund-
raiser and awards ceremony idea had
begun to crystallize and a new coa-
lition of workers was born, drawing
from all the local women's issue-
oriented groups under the new um-
brella title, the Lakeshore Women's
Services Coalition (LWSC). Three
important beneficiary groups were
easily identified as being providers
of services badly needed by area
women. One was being newly formed--
the Hotline for Battered Women. The
other two had been in operation for
several years, but with never enough
money to meet the needs: The Chau-
tauqua Day Care Project, Inc., which
served low-income and student fami-
lies as well as those able to meet
full-fee charges; and the NCCNOW
Legal Defense Fund, which was help-
ing several women involved in dis-
crimination in employment suits.
(There is now a fourth beneficiary
group--Student Parents Involved in
Education (SPIE), which provides
day care “scholarships” to student
parents who otherwise could not at-
tend school.)

Beginning in the Fall of 1978,
LWSC, with JoAnne Fischer as its
first president, met almost weekly
to iron out the details of its
first awards ceremony and fundraiser.
A cocktail party, open-house format
was adopted rather than a dinner for
two good reasons: in the less-populated,
rural community, it would be
easier to manage as a first effort,
and the "per-plate" charge could be
more reasonable while still providing
a healthy profit. The food
would be donated by coalition members
and others solicited for that specific
contribution; ingredients for the bev-
erage and party accessories would be
solicited from local businesses;
and the work of hostessing and cater-
ing the party would also be volun-
teered by local feminists. Calling
on many different sources, an invi-
tation list was assembled. A method
for soliciting contributions from
local industries and professional
offices was decided upon. One
touchy problem--where to have an
event that might draw 50 people or
150 and that needed a room which
could be a stage for the awards
ceremony--was solved when the Dean
of Fine and Performing Arts at the
local college (the State University
of New York at Fredonia) and his
wife offered to host the party in
their large organ and art studio.
And the date was set for a spring-
time Saturday beyond the season for
storms which could mean either can-
celling the event or giving a party
to which no one could come.

To the great delight of the hard-
working LWSC women, the first party
--on March 31, 1979--was a huge suc-
cess. The food turned out to be
spectacular, with each dish tastier
than the last. Aided by a delicious
punch, people mingled and chattered
and enjoyed themselves thoroughly.
And when the awards ceremony was
over, four outstanding women had
been honored--for the first time
ever in the area--for their achieve-
ment and their contribution to the
community. They were Mary Andrews,
for founding the local Sheltered
Workshop and for her special concern
for her clients; Patricia Wheelock,
for her dedication to community
service; Lucy Burgos, a former mi-
grant worker, for her work to improve
the position of farm workers; and
Mona Bishoff, for “tenaciously
claiming her rights as a woman,"
through a successful employment dis-
crimination case filed with the Equal
Employment Opportunity Commission
against a local industry.

Including the ceremony this year,
on March 9, there have been seven
successful awards and fundraising
parties sponsored by the Lakeshore
Women's Services Coalition, honoring
a total of 40 north county women and

raising by now several thousand dol-
lars for services to women. The
ingredients have remained basically
the same--good food, good company,
and a continuing wonderful feeling
in hostesses and guests alike that
it is the best party of the year
(which it truly is!).

Some things have changed, however:
It's had to be moved to a bigger
place to accommodate everyone who
wants to applaud the awardees. The
invitation list is now on the com-
puter and other operations have been
streamlined and made more efficient.
There are now two LWSC subcommittees,
one each for fundraising and the
awards, so not everyone has to be
concerned with the whole thing all
the time. A program of art songs
by women composers and an art show
of the work of area artists have
been added to the amenities of the
party. And there are now six awards.

From the beginning, the awards
were slated to reflect the various
spheres in which women tend to
achieve, and they were deliberately
named after Chautauqua County women
of a century ago who were active in
the first wave of American feminism.
The Calista Jones award was named
after a Jamestown school teacher
who refused to accept a contract
unless she was paid the same as a
man would be paid (she won); the

Dear Common Ground,

Thanks for doing such a wonderful
job with my work! (CG, March, 1995)
“We all have a dream--mine was to

illustrate--to bump off of other
people's words and make them into
images.

It was so good to see that piece
done so well. The whole issue
looked spectacular, and the work
was of such superior quality...

We've come a long way! I
enjoyed it.

Dear Women,

Have you noticed lately that much
of the public comment on the abortion
issue is not only anti-choice, but
based on doubtful, sometimes false
information?

The latest example of this is a
column in the Buffalo News by Max
McCarthy on February 24. (How ironic
that it should appear on the day when
one more abortion clinic, this one
in Texas, was bombed....obviously a
situation which doesn't merit Mr. 
McCarthy's attention!)

I HOPE THE ARTICLE MAKES YOUR
BLOOD BOIL LIKE IT DID MINE!

Purporting to be editorial opinion
the column is filled with error,
faulty reasoning and just plain false-
hood.

PLEASE WRITE A LETTER TO THE EDITOR
OF THE BUFFALO NEWS.

Since letters are printed in a
ratio to the number received, if
enough of us write we can hope to
see several letters correcting the
dangerous impressions given.

You don't need me to tell you that
the battle to keep abortion legal
is joined once again. Bernard Nathan-
son's powerful propaganda film “The
Silent Scream" is turning out to
be an important weapon in efforts to
make abortion illegal.

It is up to us to defend our
right to choose by constantly re-
minding people that just as women's
screams are not silent, neither is
their fervent desire to keep abortion
safe and legal. In a debate in
which one side refuses to distinguish
truth from falsehood, perhaps our
rallying cry should be: “The truth
will keep us free."

The Kate Peate award honors a suffrage
organizer from Dunkirk; the Caroline
Skinner Twing award honors a woman
who was a teacher and a writer
and was active in Grange, temperance,
and suffrage affairs; and the Elnora
Babcock award commemorates the Dunkirk
woman who became national press
secretary for the National Political
Equality Association, sending out
more than 200,000 articles in her
12-year tenure.

The Debbie Thomas award and the
Anne Bernstein award honor two young
women who were students at the Col-
lege at Fredonia and by their example
proved once again the contribution
which women of whatever age make to
the communities in which they live.

Now, the Lakeshore Women's Ser-
vices Coalition members who have,
incidentally, remained remarkably con-
stant and stable for seven years,
are preparing for their annual
post-party assessment and prelimin-
ary planning for next year's awards,
and for ways to raise increasing
amounts to help with increasing
budget needs.

At this point, next year's award-
ees are still among the great anon-
ymous segment of the population who
are the backbone of the community's
well-being. Already, however,
people are gearing up to nominate
the new "class," and next year's

Dear Women,

At six minutes to midnight at
the Seneca Army Depot in Romulus,
New York, women will reach into
the dark with voices, hands and
spirits joined to challenge the
oppressions that fog the clear
night sky. The Women's Encampment
for a Future of Peace and Justice
is calling women everywhere to
join in our Day of Focus on July
6, 1985. “At the fence of the
Depot, a transshipment point for
the Pershing II missiles still being
deployed to Europe, we will chal-
lenge the existence of these mis-
siles said to be able to reach their
target within 1-3 minutes. We, in
the dark of midnight, will call for
an end to the threat of “nuclear
winter," "the dark, the cold, the
chemical toxins from the fire, the
fall-out, the ultra-violet flux...
a circumstance in which life every-
where on the planet is threatened."
(Carl Sagan, in "Washington Forum
on the World-Wide Consequences of
Nuclear War.") As women we will
take back the night, reclaiming
our freedom to “walk without fear”
of rape, battery and abuse.

We will also be taking part in
the nationwide celebration of inde-
pendence that the Fourth of July
commemorates. We will recognize
that some of us have the privilege
to approach our oppressors without
fear of violent harm but we will
also question our true independence
from racism, sexism, homophobia,
poverty and other oppressions and
institutions which continue to
systematically repress people all
over the world. As a new nation-
state on July 4th, 1776, the pa-
triarchs declared the right to in-
dependence, self-determination and
self-government. Now, on July 4th
weekend 1985, we will call for
the United States government to
stop crushing the rights of inde-
pendence and self-determination
of countries other than our own in
Central America, the Caribbean and
the Middle East and in other parts
of the world.

Our strength, our power and our
threat to our oppressors comes from
our connection with each other,
uniting across the world in our di-
versity of race, class, age and sex-
ual orientation. And as we rise
connected we begin to see the con-
nectedness of our oppressions. For
example, the nuclear destruction

LWSC Awards:
Community
Involvement

by Jeanne T. Keefe, LWSC President

Joanne Schwiek, writer of the
foregoing article, is supremely
qualified to articulate the drives
and recent history of feminism in
northern Chautauqua County. Arch-
ivist at Reed Library at Fredonia,
an extremely hardworking member of
NOW and LWSC, Joanne was honored
in 1981 with the Calista Jones Award
for Advancing the Rights of Women.
She is a prime example of the quiet
steadfast support feminists give
each other.

that we challenge is closely linked
to the violence against women which
is so much a part of our society.
The violence which permeates every-
thing is a sad symptom of world and
national priorities of competition
and domination. We will rise up
together with the setting and the
rising of the heavy noon in which
we are all connected.

There are presently a few women
living on the land at Seneca. Sleets
and snow still batter our windows
and jam the doors of our outhouse
as we begin to crystallize and or-
ganize plans for our third summer.
As a sustained presence bordering
the Seneca Army Depot, our vision
of what we hope for women adapts
itself to our permanent status.
For instance, we hope that women can
form affinity groups and come to the
Encampment with plans for workshops
and actions rather than women at
the Encampment planning the entire
summer program. Individual women
can then come and join in programs
that affinity groups have brought
with them. Although other actions,
workshops and ongoing non-violence
trainings will be happening through-
out the year, our July 6th action
will be our major day of focus in
the summer of '85. It is our hope
and plea that women will be in-
spired to take part in the planning
of that action through their cor-
respondence or, even better, by
coming to the Encampment for a
weekend, a week or longer if pos-
sible to help with community dialogue
logistics, physical work that needs
to be done on the land, etc. Women
energy is needed on the land now.
Our “work weekends" will begin in
April. For more information, or to
