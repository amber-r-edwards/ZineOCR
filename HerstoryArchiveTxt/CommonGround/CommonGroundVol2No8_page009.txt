CONFERENCE REPORT

Therapists Consider New Theories

One day in January, I plucked
two invitations from my mailbox;
one to the wedding of a close
friend in New Hampshire and one
to a conference in Boston on the
subject of lesbian psychologies.
The events were scheduled one week
apart in March.

I could only surmise that the
cosmic spirit who watches over
these things was telling me it was
time for a vacation. With a chuckle
about what an exercise in life's
polarities this would be, I made
plans to head for New England.

The story of my friend's wedding,
while it is one of personal
victory, is predictable and does
not bear recounting here.

However, the story of 500 women
gathering at the Park Plaza Hotel
in Boston for three days to discuss
lesbian psychologies is another
matter altogether. What follows
is the report of one Buffalo therapist
who went, listened, watched,
absorbed, reacted, talked and grew
increasingly eager to share the
news back home.

The conference was sponsored
by the Boston Chapter of Women in
Psychology, a feminist professional
organization whose purposes include
serving as a pressure group
within the profession to raise issues
of sexism and misogyny in
our culture.

As an event, this conference on
lesbian psychologies was momentous
because even within the realm of
developing feminist theory about
the psychology of women, the issue
of lesbianism has not been directly
addressed.

Here was a forum in which lesbian
therapists could articulate
their experience, propose theories
and begin the process of making
lesbians visible in a healthy way
to a profession that approaches
them fearfully as pathological
people or not at all.

It was heady stuff.

Registration had been closed
long before the opening day of
the conference. Seating capacity
was limited to 500 and registrations
from 125 people had to be
turned away due to lack of space.

Interest was obviously high and
it came from therapists and non-
therapists alike. In workshops,
many women identified themselves
as not being practicing clinicians.
Among men, the interest level was
noticeably low. Two men registered
for the conference and were among
the 125 who were turned away due
to space limitations.

The conference agenda consisted
of one and a half days of panels
in which papers were presented to
the entire assemblage, one half
day of workshops on 43 topics,
and one day of training seminars.

Despite a truly staggering

Our mothers, as our first and
longest-lasting models of female
behavior, have critical roles in
our psychological development.

The child begins life with a
biological connection to the mother.
In infancy, after the biological
break has been made at birth, the
emotional connection remains very
strong as the infant begins to
understand that s/he is a separate
being.

As life goes on, it is mother
from whom the child must separate
emotionally to develop an individual
identity. And it is also mother,
in most families, who provides the
nurturance that fosters life and
allows the child to grow. The
need to be nurturant and the need
to be autonomous provide a constant
psychological tension.

A woman who loves another woman
brings into that relationship her
history of struggles with her mother
over such issues as nurturance versus
autonomy, acceptable female behavior
and needs for approval.

Many speakers characterized
lesbian couples as valuing intimacy
highly (and as women, being skillful
at creating it) and frequently
having trouble establishing
boundaries within the relationship.

As such, the lesbian relationship
mirrors the strength and vulnerability
of the mother-daughter relationship.

At the community level, the need
for caring and belonging remains
strong as does the difficulty in
establishing boundaries.

Carla Golden, a presenter from
Ithaca, New York, described this
as the "lesbian olympics."

The effort to establish a
safe and well-defined community in
which to belong is poignantly important
to lesbians, who are generally rejected
by a hetero world. However, the effort to
belong to the lesbian community
sometimes leads women to present
themselves in limited ways. Ms. Golden
gave the example of a young woman who
identified herself as a lesbian because
bisexuality was not accepted by the community.

She revealed in counseling
that she really was open to
relationships with men but
was fearful of the reaction
of her friends should she act on
those feelings.

Sarah Pearlman
of Jamaica Plain,
Mass., a coordinator of the
conference, spoke on the issue
of conflict.

She addressed the very issue
with which Ms. Golden's client was
grappling - the degree to which
lesbians can feel free to critique
each other's activities.

Ms. Pearlman outlined a new
task for lesbian communities: to
learn respect for personal boundaries
and give reactions gently.

"No one can tell me what to do
or how to be except perhaps very
gently," she said.

Perhaps the most difficult thing
a participant did during the three
days of the conference was to choose
workshops and seminars to attend.
The topics were very intriguing.

Among the topics I passed up
were healing the isolation between
lesbians and their families,
coping with chronic illness in lesbian
relationships, lesbian parenting,
alcoholism in the lesbian community,
issues in therapy with Latin lesbians,
identity formation for previously married
lesbians, questions and implications of
sadomasochism for lesbians and their
counselors, expanding our understanding
of anorexia/bulimia, lesbians and aging,
choosing children, issues in long-term
lesbian couple relationships, issues
facing Jewish lesbians and working
with African-American lesbian clients.

Two workshops I attended will
be discussed in detail in the May
issue of Common Ground.

Next month: Internalized homophobia
and sex therapy with lesbians.
