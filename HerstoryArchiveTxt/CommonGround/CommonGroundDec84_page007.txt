WOMAN DRIVER Earth's Daughters #22  
edited by Bonnie Johnson and Bonita  
Penfold Raquet. 51 pp. $4.00  

This book of prose and poetry ex-  
plores the writers’ (and, by exten-  
sion, women's) experiences and re-  
lationships to driving—whether  
cars or mythological chariots. The  
pieces speak of motion and moving  
on—of driving for a living or  
driving for pleasure or going ex-  
actly nowhere.  

_Woman Driver_ is a unique antho-  
logy of the realities, fantasies  
and love affairs women have with  
cars and other machines of power  
and speed.  

Cars, especially, have a curious  
place in the mythology and folk-lore  
of Americans. Cars are a sex innu-  
endo, a power symbol, a Rorschach test  
for the driver. Driving gives free-  
dom of mobility and independence.  
Driving can give one the feeling  
that they are in control and power-  
ful; one can see out, but is rela-  
tively protected and isolated from  
the outside world's intrusions.  

Cars and driving them are for  
lovers, departures, or beginnings;  
for fantasies of violence and re-  
venge or for sex.  

The title of this collection and  
the diversity of the offerings in  
this book put me off a little when  
I first started reading it. I  
wasn't quite sure what I expected,  
but I thought from the title, that  
the contents might be humorous and  
maybe tongue-in-cheek.  
There are some very wry and funny  
pieces, but on second reading, I  
began to better understand the ser-  
ious concept of women in control,  
"Woman Drivers," and to look at these  
poems and prose pieces as very inti-  
mate revelations about the writers'  
perceptions of themselves—more inti-  
mate because of the psychological  
weight that the automobile carries  
in this culture. It is also a  
telling picture about women. I sus-  
pect everyone will find themselves  
in this book at least once.  

The book is ever so slightly on  
the "dark" side—an undercurrent of  
madness or wildness is there. "Wo-  
man Driver" is a wonderful concept,  
well put together and effective.  
Read it a second and third time to  
let the subtlety and flavor develop.

Woman-Centered  
Pregnancy  

R.N., Francie Downer and the Federation of Fem-  
inist Women's Health Centers. Cleis  
Press, 1984. $11.95.  

WOMAN-CENTERED PREGNANCY AND  
BIRTH is an information-packed re-  
source essential to any woman who  
is even thinking of getting preg-  
nant. It contains well illustrated,  
concise chapters in plain English  
on:  

* well-woman prenatal care, including  
self-examination, nutrition, exercise,  
questions to ask prospective mid-  
wives and physicians.  
* donor insemination, including  
methods of ovulation detection, how  
to choose between privately arranged  
and medically arranged insemination  
(and alternative sperm bank resources)  
plus thoughtful and supportive dis-  
cussion of donor insemination for  
lesbian mothers, including a sample  
co-mothers' parenting agreement.  
* tactics for avoiding unnecessary,  
costly and dehumanizing medical in-  
tervention...at home, in the birth-  
ing center, or in the hospital.  
* incisive feminist analysis of the  
alternative birthing movement, in-  
cluding documentation of actions  
women have taken to fight increasing  
technological control over the birth  
of our children.  
* childbirth resources in the United  
States, bibliography, glossary,  
index...and over 100 photographs,  
drawings and charts.  

The authors report that the range  
of experiences that physicians con-  
sider "normal" is getting narrower  
and narrower—what was considered  
"normal" ten years ago is considered  
“high risk" today. Physicians can  
be threatened with revocation of  
malpractice insurance should they  
refuse to order the intrusive medical  
procedures considered part of “rou-  
tine" hospital care...Midwives are  
increasingly being pressured to emu-  
late physicians and carry out pro-  
cedures they once opposed.  

A "totally normal, not-interfered-  
with" birth is nearly impossible to  
find in the United States.  
Withholding food from laboring  
mothers, keeping family and  
friends out of birth, forcing her  
legs into stirrups, ordering "  
emergency" cesareans, putting silver  
nitrate into her baby's eyes with  
or without her consent...are as  
routine as the routine episiotomies  
which the authors charge are actu-  
ally mutilations of the clitoris.  

WOMAN-CENTERED PREGNANCY AND  
BIRTH was written to reverse this  
trend of increasing technological  
control over women's bodies—by  
enabling women to advocate for a  
safe, woman-centered birthing exper-  
ience. This book can help some  
women make informed choices about  
the birth and pregnancy they exper-  
ience, and can be used as a guide  
and educational tool for her family  
and friends.
