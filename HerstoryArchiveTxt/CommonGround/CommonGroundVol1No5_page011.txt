only fair

since we all know that
man

means everybody

and we're all part of
mankind

and that

his and her

or

he and she

is too

cumbersome

choppy and

clumsy

to use in elegant language
or in flowing sentences

then by all means
let's unclutter our language
and unload some of the meaning
from that weary word
in the name of simplicity
we'll call all of you
adult males
something else,
something new
like
pahroohies
or
sachawatches
and keep
man and men
for all of us

and see how

we like being called something

SEAMUS HAINEY READ TODAY

Seamus
A poem

Hainey read today.

about waterwomen,

who are not clean.

about bog men,

who deserve better than they

A poem

Nymph won't do for waterwomen,
said Seamus Hainey.
I forget exactly why,
presumably
something about cleanliness.

Nymph won't do

for Seamus Hainey,

who is

feeding on people's

dreams

to compare himself to Wordsworth.

Seamus Hainey read today,
uncharming seducer,

his rhythm skin deep.
People's dreams

are pervasive.

JANUARY 1983

THE DANCE OF THE PHOSPHENES

Tasks sit waiting to be done,
And they will wait.
My eyelids are down,

The eyes underneath watch a parade of colors.

The pressure of a fingertip on one
Sets forth blasts of orange and magenta.

When I was a child lying awake at
Night in bed,

I used to press my eyelids

And watch the colors dance.
Then, when I would open them,
Little bits of brightness would lie
Suspended in the air,

Until they fell into vanishing.

Those interludes of private color
Comforted me;

Each pressure bathed me in a new abstract.
Now, when things are tedious or dull

I close my eyes in expectation

And wait for the rainbow.

Nicole S. Urdang

The child has waited
A lifetime

For you

To remember her

Waits at a school bus stop
Small

Straight

Bent double inside

With fear:

You have forgotten.

In her dreams

You stand

Ready for travel

Not touching her.

You say

"I am going away now,
And never coming back."

She has not forgotten.

Untitled I

You are rooted in me
Buried like a fault-line
Trembling my earth.

The silver smoke
Of you
Fills my membranes.

You are embedded in me
Under my nails
In the lines of my palms.

I will dig you out.

Mary Roseberry

More Often Than Not

More often than not

Tired of writing I

Slip into you but more

often than not there's nothing
to slip into I

get the message more often than
writing about the situation is
only worsening but

I'm writing less figuring I
shouldn't document the fall

of you

into my arms I

don't want you in them and I
tire of telling you

why.

Roberta Hayes

self portrait

believe me I used to be louder
with wide chapped lips

each corner of my mouth

sucking long stringy hair

rib cage like a Biafran baby
wearing black ankle-high sneakers
no socks no underwear no bra
sometimes no shirt

damn those days gone

still don't wear much underneath
hair so short can't suck on it
have leather cowgirl boots

must wear socks

carry my rib cage proud
occasionally take off my shirt

let my hands move over
rounded shoulders
down my bare chest
linger over my belly
glide to the sides of hips
want to feel muscle

feel change
touch touch touch
child into woman
