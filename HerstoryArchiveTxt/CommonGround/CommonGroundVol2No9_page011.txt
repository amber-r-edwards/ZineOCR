© FRIENDS ©

They had been friends for nearly 20  
years. Then they quarreled. Afterwards  
neither could remember what it  
was about. And each was unwilling to  
make the first gesture towards recon-  
ciliation.

When Jane and Vic had moved here,  
their son had been only three. Lonely,  
she had become active in her new church.  
And there she had met Marie. It turned  
out that Marie also had a husband. And  
a little boy of three.

Jane and Marie saw each other at Sun-  
day morning services. They both work-  
ed Monday nights at Bingo. And began  
to go for coffee afterwards. They be-  
came friends.

When Marie's son turned four, Jane  
baked his birthday cake. When Jane  
fell and injured her back, Marie cared  
for her son so that Jane could recup-  
erate.

As the holidays approached that first  
year, they made plans: they would cel-  
ebrate Thanksgiving dinner at Marie's  
house; Christmas at Jane's. And a tra-  

dition began that would be repeated for  
nearly two decades.

They discovered that their wedding  
anniversaries were both in July, so  
they threw a party together. A "sixties"  
party where everyone wore jeans  
and turtleneck sweaters and black  
berets and read poems about "Nothing-  
ness."

Their sons grew strong and sturdy  
and started school together.

Marie and Jane shared holidays and  
recipes and jokes. They shared each  
other's triumphs and disappointments  
and pain... Marie's mother dies...and  
Jane's favorite sister. And they com-  
forted one another.

Their sons graduated from elementary  
school. Then high school. And began  
college. Taller than their mothers  
now.

And then a day came when tempers  
were short-fused...nerves frayed...ugly  
words spoken...a door slammed. Ir-  
retrievably.

A year went by. Birthdays were ig-  

nored; Christmas bypassed. The split  
widened. Deepened. Hardened. Friends  
tried to bridge the gulf, to bring them  
together. Could not. Their lives  

went on but in different directions.

Then one bitter January night, as  
Marie sat at her kitchen table, sip-  
ping coffee, the phone rang. Her son  
answered and with a stunned look on  
his face, passed the phone to her.  
"It's for you, Mom," he said.

It was Jane, sobbing. "Vic had a  
heart attack. I just left the hos-  
pital and...and...I had to call my  
oldest friend."

Marie's eyes widened, filled with  
tears. "I'll be right over," she said.

Marie drove through the quiet dark  
night to Jane's house. Rang the bell.  
Waited.

The door opened. Each woman took  
a step forward. And then their arms  
were around each other, hugging, cry-  
ing.

"I'm sorry," they both murmured.

Swing Shift is fun, but unfocused. There  
are some good moments, but a lot of  
unrealized potential for a movie  
exploring the condition of women in  
the 1940s, even a movie with a femin-  
ist edge to it. It is not the  
slapstick comedy it seems to be in  
the previews, but it fails to find  
another direction. Still, it nearly  
comes together in the end. Kay and  
Hazel bridge the gap between them--  
their men are back, the war is over  
and they have lost their jobs,  

their lives have totally changed,  
but they still manage to reach each  
other. The movie ends with their  
arms around each other, as they  

both say, “We showed ‘em, didn't  
we?!"

We Better Believe

In this country  
we care more about our cars  
than our children

I don't hear anyone  
hollering about  
all the teachers laid off

or not hired--  
only steel workers  
and auto workers

When children  
are poorly built  
and hazards to the road

we wring our hands  
and relegate them to jails  
(our human junk yards)

where they quickly become  
hazardous waste--  
seeping back into society

If we were wise  
we would be willing  
to match

dollar for dollar  
education  
with the military

we would give teachers  
tough courses  
in family therapy

give them time  
and money--  
to work with the family

What if by so doing  
we could eliminate  
most crime and war

What if we dared

to believe  
in a better world?
