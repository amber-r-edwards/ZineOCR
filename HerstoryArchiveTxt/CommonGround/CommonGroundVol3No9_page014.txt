EMMA IS

Emma has some exciting activities/offers coming up in May that everyone in the women's community can take advantage of! Emma is celebrating her ninth birthday this month and hopes to bring lots of people into the store during the week of May 11 through May 18th. You'll find a 10% discount on all sales of $5.00 or more AND a large table of old and new books at 50% off... The sale will be kicked off with an open house/party on May 11 from 12-5 PM at Emma, 168 Elmwood Avenue. There will be refreshments and it could be an enjoyable way to get to know some new people, if you're so inclined! We will raffle off a variety of valuable/interesting/fun items, including an oil lamp, Mama Judy dolls, books, cards and more. Please join us on May 11 and/or sometime in the following week. Emma needs your support, and while we have been getting in some new stock, we want to continue to replenish Emma's wares to be able to serve our women's community better. Some of the new stock includes

Cris Williamson's new LP "Prairie Fire" - They're likely to go fast, so Cris fans, come right on in and "get them while they're hot! There are two new books added to the "Women's Health" section of the store. Women-Centered Pregnancy and Birth is a wonderful collection of information on the subject which defies myths surrounding pregnancy. It is written from a feminist perspective and is a great resource for almost any aspect of pregnancy imaginable. Choices - A Teen Woman's Journal is an excellent gift for a very young woman. It is designed to help teens become more aware of themselves - mentally, physically and sexually, as well as to give direction for career choices and other practical considerations for the present and the future. The book is attractive and thought-provoking and would be a welcome addition to a young woman's bookshelf.

The Local Women's Postcard Series that we told you about last month has been a smashing success. Original artwork by women of Western New York appears on the cards, which are 50¢ or a set of 12 for $5.75. They've been going like hotcakes and well they should - they're a wonderful testimony to the richness and diversity of talent of our WNY women.

One last thing, speaking of artwork - did you know that Emma loves to display women's artwork (photography, crafts, paintings, etc.) in her windows? If you are interested in arranging an opportunity to expose your work to the community, please call Emma - 885-2285 - to talk about setting up your creations...

We'll see you on May 11th at the party at Emma!

Pro-Choice Speak-Out

THE FOLLOWING IS A SAMPLE LETTER THAT CAN BE USED AS AN IDEA OF THE TYPE OF LETTER REQUESTED IN THE PRO-CHOICE SPEAK OUT CAMPAIGN DESCRIBED ON PAGE THREE OF THIS ISSUE.

NARAL --

I want you to know how deeply I support your work to keep abortion a legal and safe choice for all women. I have two young daughters of my own and I want their right to choice protected for them. Especially because I know from my own experience the terror of an unwanted pregnancy.

In 1968, when I was 19 and in college, I became pregnant. I had used birth control - a diaphragm which I was told was safe and effective. But I didn't know it was only 96.3% effective, and I came into that four percent.

I didn't know what to do because I wasn't married and I was living on my own against my family's wishes. I couldn't go to my family and I certainly didn't feel like I was old enough to take care of a child. I would have been forced to quit college. At that point in my life, I truly believed that abortion was the only alternative.

Of course, finding a doctor was difficult because of the laws against abortion. After weeks of searching, a family friend who I'd confided in heard about a doctor in Colorado who supposedly had helped many women. I remember driving through the mountains feeling terribly scared because of all the stories I'd heard about illegal abortionists.

I was one of the lucky ones. This was a doctor with a real clinic -- someone who was not a butcher and had the equipment. In two days it was over and I was able to resume my life. No woman should be frightened about getting an abortion the way I was back then when it was illegal. Please, please keep working for this essential personal right.
