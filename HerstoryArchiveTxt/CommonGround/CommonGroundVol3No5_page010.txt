Gender Gap

Dear Common Ground,

I would like to add something to
the discussion found in the "View-
point" by Hope Hoetzer and
Phillip Cook on the
gender gap. I remark
largely on a
political scientist with expertise
in the area of women and politics.

There is and is not a ‘gender
gap.’ Substantially fewer women
than men hold elected and appointed
office. More women register as
Democratic than Republican. Relatively
speaking, the Democratic party is
more facilitative of women's entry
to office at the national level,
e.g., to party, congressional,
executive and judicial posts; the
Republican party may be equally
more facilitative at the local
level nationwide. More women are
found in local than national office,
although in both cases the numbers
are mostly not large. Republican
women activists have tended to view
their party role rather tradition-
ally; they often report satisfac-
tion with this role. Democratic wo-
men activists take on a party role
very like that of Democratic men
activists and do so enthusiastically.

Among the electorate, the
‘gender gap’ vanishes. Women
and men voters are equally likely
to vote for a woman running against
a man, or a man running against a
woman, on a major party ticket
in a general election on the con-
gressional, state legislative or muni-
cipal level. Taken as a whole,
voters do not discriminate by sex—
nor, as it happens, by age. What
makes the difference? Party identi-
fication and whether the candidate
is an incumbent and running in an
urban, suburban or rural setting,
as well as economic issues, tell us
more about election results than
does either sex or age per se.
In terms of citizen level par-
ticipation such as voting, passing
around politics, etc., there
are no longer any significant dif-
ferences to speak of between women
and men. On the issues, despite
myths to the contrary, most statis-
tically reliable evidence shows no
significant differences between
women and men. Importantly, citi-
zens who are articulate on the issues
are relatively few; and as a rule,
among ‘issue publics,’ women and
men tend most often to fall in to-
gether on either side of an issue.
There is nonetheless such a thing
as issue voting; and issue voting
may be increasing over time. It
often is not the determining factor
or the only factor at work in
general elections. Only when we
break issues down finely, as in the
foreign relations area, do sex dif-
ferences emerge. Of significance,
however, is the fact that overall
few women or men take a strong or
any position on these fine distinc-
tions.

On feminist issues, sometimes
we find men more supportive than
women, although not by a large mar-
gin. Men's feminist issue positions
tend to be grounded in a ‘liberal’
ideology; women's, in what might
be called an awareness of their dis-
advantaged status. The only decent-
ly substantiated and large sex dif-
ference I have seen on feminist is-
sues appears among the women and
men in our population who become
new parents. The new mothers move
temporarily to a more ‘conservative
position than they previously held;
the new fathers do not change.

I beg to differ with the state-
ment that the real issue is age.
The difference Hoetzer and Cook re-
port is in part generational. Age
and generation are not the same
thing, although many overlook their
difference. Generation carries socio-
historical, even economic implica-
tions that age does not. The differ-
ence reported is also in part the
consequence of what some call family
life cycle. At different points in
our life, we will find ourselves
falling in with different population
groups depending on, e.g., our mar-
ital status, the number of children
we have, the expenses we encounter,
how we meet these expenses, etc.

Additionally, there are a
fundamental piece of information important to readers in
judging the particular poll's relia-
bility. Even the age; and
consequently reveals there are a
number of polls available on the
election; and the difference
Hoetzer & Cook precede together
in their discussion, may not present
an accurate picture of the matter under
discussion.

To carry this commentary a bit
further, the discussion of sex dif-
ferences in the media about the
1984 general election has mostly
focused on the presidential race.
There were numerous other races,
including congressional ones. Many
Democratic voters (male and female)
may have and most likely did depart
from their party identification for
the presidential vote and adhere
to their identification in voting
for candidates for lower office.

In the 1984 election a presidential
incumbent sought re-election on
an ostensibly strong economic re-
cord. Given these circumstances,
it is not surprising that many De-
mocrats voted for a Republican for
president.

This result is not a poor re-
flection on Geraldine Ferraro’s
candidacy, by the way! Nor does
it indicate sexism in the electorate.

Much election commentary in
recent years has centered on the
question of whether a party realign-
ment is in progress. Simply put,

NEEDS HELP

We Need Money.

The South Towns Women's Resource
Center was founded eight years ago
as a voluntary organization for
the purpose of linking people in
need with available community re-
sources, namely, job opportuni-
ties, legal assistance and medi-
cal care to name a few.

Today, we have grown far be-
yond our original expectations.
Due to the overwhelming response
from the Southtown and Buffalo
areas, we needed and now have a
paid staff member to meet those
needs—to direct people to the
most helpful community resources.
For example, in October, 1984
alone:

--phone calls to the center num-
bered 105

--a job retraining program in-
cluded 60 men and women

--a professionals awareness seminar
included 60 men and women

We depend on you. All of our
ability to continue to keep our
center open and to meet these
high standards depends on your
donations.

If sufficient funds are not
forthcoming immediately, a vital
community link will be lost!

We are located in the Presby-
terian Church, 177 Main Street,
Hamburg, N.Y. For further infor-
mation on our center and our needs,
please feel free to visit or to
call Pat Zimmerman, Resource Cen-
ter Coordinator at 648-3448.

Tax-deductible donations,
large or small, may be mailed to:

We thank you for your support.

PAGE 10 COMMON GROUND JANUARY 1985

It is interesting to
note women largely moving into the
Democratic party and men into the
Republican one; but the apparent
parity in registration figures
combined with voting patterns and
distribution of candidates for
office across party tickets does
not seem to justify speculation
about the polarization of women and
party.

The ‘moral of the story' it
seems to me, is that we ought not
to burden women when we do not
burden men as a population group
with the sort of argument contained
in the Common Ground viewpoint,
including the challenge to defeat
Griffin. Women have enough burdens
in society without being set up
for failure in the electoral
arena, namely as a voting bloc.
Because we have not voted as a bloc
overall, we have received unfavor-
able commentary; e.g., the what-do-
women-want routine. This commentary
has been going on ever since rati-
fication of the suffrage amendment
and the 1920 election.

Women are demographically diverse,
understandably involved in any
number of cross-cutting interests.
Stereotypes to the contrary, this
is not new news. Despite their
diversity, women are no more or
less in command of issues than men,
who are also diverse and who also
do not vote as a bloc. An issue
such as comparable worth, which
Hoetzer and Cook mention, is not
simple—it is, what is
more, a complicated issue. To look
at another issue mentioned by
Hoetzer and Cook, as things cur-
rently stand, middle-class women are
probably not likely to identify
with the feminization of poverty.

Dear Common Ground,

The next project for the Coali-
tion of Equal Rights will be re-
comparable worth. Our goal is
to develop a bank of information
on which we can draw to prepare
fact sheets or position papers for
specific purposes. For example,
an organization could request
information to educate their own
members about the legal and social
implications of the ERA or compar-
able worth. Further, despite
years of debate, the general pub-
lic is woefully misinformed or
ignorant with respect to the ERA
and few would argue that our
elected representatives are in
need of “enlightenment” with re-
gard to equity.

Categories may include, but
will not be limited to the follow-
ing:

Employment and Protective Labor Law
Social Security; Pensions and
Insurance

Education (from the viewpoint of
what is being taught, who is
teaching, who is administrating,
etc.)

The Military and the Draft
Criminal Law (prostitution, rape
and sexual assault)

Family Law (marriage, divorce,
marital property)

ERA and the Housewife

Impact of the ERA in Pennsylvania
and other states which have state
ERAs

Abortion, Unisex Bathrooms and
other Fairy Tales

Legal Status of Women in New York
State

Religion

Within these categories we
are interested in collecting
facts, statistics and instances
of discrimination (generic, not
anecdotal) which support the
need for a federal ERA, legal
proceedings and recent court de-
cisions relative to equity and
any other related material. If
there are members of your organ-
ization who would be interested
in helping in the research,
compilation of material, editing,
etc., please let them know about
our project. All are welcome at
our meetings.

For more information, call Pat
Seaver at 688-5893, no later than
10 p.m.

Sincerely,

Coalition for
Equal Rights
