Dear Great-Grandma,  
I never knew you, only your  
picture. I found it in an up-  

stairs bedroom, lying in the bottom  

of a box of old photographs. Your  
face was plump. I wanted you to  
feed me. The lines in it, Dutch  
streams. Your eyes, Delft Blue of  
understanding.  

I knew your son, Jan, my grand-  
father. He left your kitchen, and  
his father’s boot, as a young boy.  
Something about being kicked in the  

canal for scuffing his wooden shoes.  
Jan worked on ships, and studied for  

his captain's papers. But he went  
to the United States instead, just  
in time to be drafted. The Army  

made him a cook. Part of his skull  
was blown away, so the Army doctor  
put a steel plate in his head.  

Jan sent you money over the  
years, so that you could afford to  

feed your  

young with  

blood. When he received  

the news that told him you had starved to  
death, Jan cried bitterly. Feeling  
helpless, he raged at you, great-  
grandma.  

I, his granddaughter, knew his  
anger, this man you couldn't be  
close to, a man who had hurt too  
much for one lifetime. Jan had  
become John in his new land, and  
taken up house painting. But I'll  
always know he left his heart with  
you, along with his old name.

Sarah tells stories. Okay,  
so Sarah tells lies. Up to now  
her lies have only been ex-  
aggerations of real happenings  
at school or around our neigh-  
borhood, as far as I know. This  
divorce story. Why would Sarah  
tell anyone Dan and I are  
getting a divorce?  

Mrs. Morrison agreed to handle  
the situation. She said she'd  
pick a good time to have a talk  
with Sarah. It has been nearly  
a week. If she has said anything  
to Sarah, it is odd that Sarah  
has not told me about it. I  
hope she will take care of the  
problem and soon. I don't know  
what I would say to Sarah.  

At three o'clock Sarah comes home.  

She drops her lunchbox off on  
the kitchen counter and goes  

straight up to her room. This  
is not like her at all. Sarah  
usually comes home to tell me

What is to be said of a grandmother  
arriving on a train  

wearing a new black 1927 shawl  

clutching a valise holding black fabric  

to be made into a funeral dress  

for the mother of a sick child still alive?  
The child lived. So did her mother.  

The grandmother also lived - alone -  
malnourished in love,  
surrounded by good intentions.

all the news of her day. She dogs  
my every step while I fix dinner.  
Something is very wrong.  

When I go up to her room and  
knock on the door, I can hear  
her crying. But she will  
not let me in. Did Mrs.  

Morrison pick today to talk  
with Sarah about the divorce  
story? If I knew she would  
make my little girl cry, I  
would have told her to forget  
about it.  

Dan comes home at four from  
the factory and goes right  
up to Sarah. Dan and Sarah are  
kindred spirits. If anyone can  
reach her, Dan can. If only  
Sarah can learn to demand  
a tiny bit less.  

He coaxes her downstairs and  
they begin to set the dining  
room table for dinner. I am in  
the kitchen, right next door,  
eavesdropping on their conversa-  
tion.  

"I picked some real pretty flo-  
wers for Mrs. Morrison today,"  
Sarah says. "She didn't like  
them. She didn't even look  

at them. She took me over to the  
bad kids' corner and talked to  
me. She said she knew you and  
Mommy aren't getting a divorce,  
like I said you were, 'cause  
Mommy told her so Friday. She  
said I was wrong to tell her  
about the divorce."  
"Well?" Dan asks. “Weren't you?”  
“I don't know. When Janey  
told Mrs. Morrison that her  

Schoenthal has had several short  
stories published in juvenile and  
adult magazines. A non-fiction  
reflective piece was published in  
the May 1985 issue of COMMON GROUND.  
The article was entitled "MY  
MOTHER'S SMILE."
