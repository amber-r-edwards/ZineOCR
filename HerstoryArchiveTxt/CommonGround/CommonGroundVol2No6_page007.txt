EMMA IS...

WELCOMING MARY DALY for a  
book signing reception on Friday,  
February 10, 1984 from 4 to 6 p.m.!!  
Bring your copies of her books that you  
already have, or plan to pick one up at  
EMMA, and come for a time of stimulating  
conversation! If you pre-pay an  
order for Mary's forthcoming book PURE  
LUST: ELEMENTAL FEMINIST PHILOSOPHY at  
the time of the book signing event, an  
autographed copy of the book will be  
sent to EMMA and reserved for you as  
soon as it is released. The new book is  
planned for release early in April, and  
the price will be about $17.00.

Mary Daly's first book was THE  
CHURCH AND THE SECOND SEX, originally  
published in 1968. This book was out  
of print during the early 1970s, and  
Mary wrote a new post-Christian intro-  
duction that is included in the re-  
publication of 1975. Her second book,  

The Leaving  

my children came  

as gifts to me  

two precious pearls  
from the wide-lipped  
oyster shed into  

the roundings of  

the sea and moon  

they flood me  

with their windy fears  
seaweed aches  

and gulls soaring  

then move away on  

a fixed schedule  
always returning  

the rhythm reassuring  
in its constancy  

farther and farther  

they wash away  

in a tide that pulls each  

to her own far shore  

we distance ourselves  

and I prepare for the drought  
cultivating my aloneness now  
as another imperfect pearl  
another treasured shell

published in 1975, was BEYOND GOD THE  
FATHER: TOWARD A PHILOSOPHY OF WOMEN'S  
LIBERATION. Her third book GYN/ECOLOGY:  
THE METAETHICS OF RADICAL FEMINISM was  
published in 1978, and represents a  
classic work in feminist philosophy.  
The new book, PURE LUST, evolves from  
GYN/ECOLOGY, and focuses on the tradi-  
tional deadly sin of lust. An excerpt  
from the new book was published in the  
Fall, 1983 issue of TRIVIA: A JOURNAL  
OF IDEAS (available at EMMA).

Mary's visit to EMMA is planned in  
conjunction with her appearance for a  
speaking engagement in Rochester on  
February 9 at 8:00 p.m. in Room 140  
Hutchinson Hall, River Campus,  
University of Rochester. This is the  
correct date; the date has been listed  
incorrectly in some previous publica-  
tions. She will be speaking on  
"Re-membering: The Elemental Powers of  
Women", and will give a glimpse of what  
to expect in PURE LUST!

Whenever you plan to make a visit  
to EMMA in the next few weeks, be pre-  
pared for some other exciting new  
titles that we now have in stock.  
Everyone's marvelous support during the  
recent holidays has made it possible  
for us to bring in several interesting  
books, and records that we know you  
will enjoy browsing through.

Another exciting program for our  
Buffalo Women's Voices 1984 series is  
"Poetry to Music" planned for later in  
February. This exciting program will  

feature Melissa Ragona reading poetry,  
Jill Kurek playing acoustic guitar and  

Looking Glass  

the mirror speaks  

riddles to me  
unfamiliar face  

echoing onward  
affixed in  

keyboards, and Teresa Taylor reading  
and performing! Exact details of the  
date, time and place are almost con-  
firmed but not quite - call EMMA for  
this information. Throughout the year  
we will be featuring local women  
artists in performance, providing a  
unique and rare opportunity for  
talented local women to be seen and  
heard in performance. These concerts  
are also benefits for EMMA, so plan to  
join us for these events, and watch for  
announcements of other concerts in this  
series throughout the year!

In March, EMMA will be having a new  
member and friends potluck. This is an  
opportunity to learn more about EMMA,  
particularly if you are interested in  
the possibility of becoming more  
involved in what we are doing.  
Everything at EMMA happens because of  
the energy and devotion of many women,  
and while it does not have material  
rewards, the personal rewards are  
tremendous! There is no long-term com-  
mitment in attending the potluck, but  
we do promise an informative discussion  
and good food! If you are interested  
in attending, call EMMA to let us know  
of your interest. As plans are made,  
you will be contacted.

We wish to extend to everyone our  
appreciation for your continued  
support! EMMA is growing stronger and  
beginning to recover from our difficult  
year of 1983. Our growing success will  
continue to be possible because of all  
of your efforts to help make this  
possible!

an endless jigsaw puzzle  

a stranger, I am not  
who I once was  
yet  

at the same moment  

I am no longer  
who I am  

the Sphinx's riddle, promise  

to another world  

or the Great Master's secretive smile  
woman's prerogative personified  

change once initiated  

takes hold of the slipping glass  

and finally rights it  

the hidden ones within  

have seeped out  

as the image  
who I will become  

smiles
