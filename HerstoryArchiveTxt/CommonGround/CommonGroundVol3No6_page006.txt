THE ARTS

INTERVIEW:
‘WOMANSPEAK’

by Sharon Green

"WomenSpeak" is a relatively
new radio program on WBFO/FM 88
radio, and it is an important
addition to Western New York
media as a program for
women. Part of a series, it airs
Fridays at 7 p.m. on alternating
weeks. Its producers and hosts are
Dr. Sharon Leder, Art
Professor at U.B. in American
Studies/Women's Studies, and Marion
Owezar, Graduate Assistant
in the field. A third originator
of the show who was in-
terviewed is Laiyee Ng, a Special
Major in Communications.

CG: How did the idea for a
women's program originate?

MO: While I was developing
a program format for “WomenSpeak” and took it to
David Benders, Program Director
for FM 88. He gave us a “let's
try and do one show" sort of a
thing. And so we did. Our first
program on October 5, 1984, was
on “The Consciousness of the
Incest Survivor," featuring guest
speakers from the Speakers Committee
of the Erie County Bureau on
Rape and Sexual Assault, along
with Batyr Weinbaum, author of
The Curious Courtship of Women's
Liberation and Socialism, and
Pictures of Patriarchy, and
currently a graduate student in
American Studies/Women's Studies
at U.B.

SL: Radio is a good device for
creating a visible feminist pre-
sence. People talk about the show,
people hear my voice for example,
and identify the show, and it
has gotten more visibility than I
thought it would.

MO: I've also noticed word-of-
mouth occurring which is what you
want.

CG: So you got graduate credit
for your proposal?

MO: Yes. Also, at first it was
to be a "trial show."

SL: However, now that they at
FM 88 know us, they are letting
us do what we want. At first,
the program director was monitor-
ing the show and being present
during our tapings, but he no
longer does that.

LN: I think it is a little un-
usual that Marion got trained
specifically as engineer for the
show. Usually, FM 88 not only
comes up with the idea for a show,
they also find an appropriate
announcer or interviewer, and
they bring in their engineer.
But we pick our own guests, our
own subjects and the appropriate
dates.

CG: So this program is unusual
on several different levels.

SL: Exactly! My first interview
with the program director explored
the question, “Whose show is this?"
Women's Studies did want to spon-
sor a show, but the question was
raised, “Will the show really
work since the subject is only
women? Is the time right for
this?" Because I'm centered in
both Women's Studies and the
women's community; the question
echoed for me, "Will we all
have to justify this show?"
I wanted to proceed on the
assumption that there is women's
programming.

MO: And I reminded the program
director that there isn't any
programming for women.

CG: At this point, how long do
you think the program will con-
tinue?

SL: We'll have it at least through
the spring semester. It really
might be up to us, and how long
we can sustain the show. Another
factor is what kind of response
the radio station gets to the
show.

MO: Sharon and I never envisioned
that either of us would be the
only production people on "Women-
Speak." Because of my own past
experience in the media, my in-
terest was to make available to
women a training ground where
they could get experience working
in all aspects of radio. It is
extremely difficult for women to
get into the media, or for them
to get internships. And I have
no real intention of retaining
the production position. I'd
like to have community women in-
volved, as well as university
women (who, incidentally, can get
credit for such work), because
FM 88 should be there for all
women.

SL: Good audience response can
be powerful. During FM 88's
fundraising week, several pledges
were made during one show, so
that proved people were listening.
In addition, we need listeners
to send in letters, to call or
respond in some way, to let FM
88 know that we have an audience.

MO: Also, we don't pretend to
know everything that is of in-
terest to our audience, so it
is very important for people to
let us know what they want to
hear.

CG: Tell us about some of the
shows you've done so far.

MO & LN: We already mentioned
our first show. We also had a
show featuring an exclusive
press conference with Shirley
Chisholm and we were the only
ones in Western New York who
gave her air time before the
November elections. Other topics
were the Seneca Women's Peace
Encampment; the Women's Poetry
Workshop at U.B.; Nan Hoffman
on the music of Freedom and Strug-
gle, and Women's Music; Ellen
DuBois and Bonita Hampton on
Women's Studies at U.B.; Janet
House (Buffalo’s only shelter for
battered women and their children);
and Behjat Henderson on Women and the Middle
East.

SL: We also talked with Judy
Smith, the President of N.O.W.,
who was in Buffalo, but since
she held a press conference open
to all media, it became difficult
to edit for use on our show.

CG: How did Laiyee hook up with
the two of you?

LN: I learned about the show
from Sharon and I became interested
because of my interest in
communications. The experience
has been very profitable for me,
because I am able to participate
as fully as I want, which is not
always possible in most circum-
stances in the media.

MO: Laiyee has been an absolute
godsend. She has essentially
taken over all the publicity
for example.

CG: What is your working rela-
tionship like?

LN: As you know, our show is
run collectively; and I think
we all work very well in the
framework.

SL: I've worked in different
collectives in Women's Studies,
but what is different for me in
this is the primary importance
of deadlines, timing and sched-
uling different guests' times.
In my course, I talk about the
“myth of immediacy" and how the
media is pushed by this myth to
“create” news, sometimes even
before it happens. I needed to
learn how to see through this
myth, to know that sometimes
shows we would like to do be-
cause they are typical—for ex-
ample, Judy Goldsmith and the
Gender Gap, right before the na-
tional election—are not possible
technically. The converse is
also true. We often need to be
able to organize and work at the
drop of a hat, when guests and/or
the studio is available. This
is quite different from knowing
you have a regular meeting time.

CG: In the future, will you
always need at least three people
to produce the show?

SL: Yes, I've been visiting
classes at U.B. to talk about
student internships and you should
see students’ faces light up!
Women have heard the show and
want to be involved in it.

MO: I want to emphasize again
that we'd also like to see com-
munity women involved. You cer-
tainly don't have to be part of
the university.

CG: Have you encountered any
negative feedback to the show?

MO: Overall, we're all in it
together and it is getting better.
However, WBFO has a certain
mind for the UB Forum
Series, to be a news show of
"hard" news. So when we went
from two political shows to
include arts and literature, they
thought we were getting too
"soft."

MO: Interestingly, we thought
we were too political at first.
After all, there is much more
to a woman's life than just na-
tional elections. We understood
that, but we had to broaden the
understanding of the program
director. My own opinion is
that anything in life is part
of a woman's life, because a
woman is part of life. To me,
what makes something "hard” or
"soft" is subjective.

One of our goals is to
make this vehicle accessible to
women who wouldn't ordinarily be
on the air. So I’m happy when
someone is there talking about
her work. Part of my job is
drawing the guest out, estab-
lishing rapport. Also, concerning
feedback, one woman who
listened to our show with Shirley
Chisholm said that the show made
her feel that it was more im-
portant to vote. She had been
wavering, but she was impressed
after hearing Chisholm's views.
That kind of reaction is very
helpful to know about.

CG: How can people contact you
if they'd like to be interviewed
or if they have a suggestion for
your program?

SL: People could call Women's
Studies at U.B. at 831-3405, or
call Marion or myself at American
Studies, 636-2546.

LN: Because critique and feed-
back are so important, we'd like
to encourage any Common Ground
readers who listen to us to let
WBFO know that you do.

SL: An organization called The
American Women in Radio and Tele-
vision has a commendation award
every year. WBFO's general man-
ager has agreed to sponsor us
and nominate us for this award,
so we will be submitting a tape
of one of our shows.

CG: That seems like a real in-
dication of both their acceptance
and their support of your show.

MO: Yes, the enthusiasm we've
encountered is incredible.

CG: Well, we at Common Ground
congratulate you on your work
for women in our area. We in-
vite our readers to listen to
“WomenSpeak" on alternating Fri-
days at 6:30 p.m. The topic of
the show on Feb. 8 will be "Fem-
inist Approaches to Theatre,"
with guest Anna Kay France.
