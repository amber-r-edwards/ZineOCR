ARE

YOU

HUNGRY?

If you qualify for federal food
distribution programs, you may be
able to use FOOD STAMPS. They are
government coupons that can be used
like money at stores to buy nutri-
tious foods.

YOU CAN GET FOOD STAMPS,

— own a car, a house and/or land;

— have money in the bank;

— are employed;

— get Social Security, SSI, un-
employment compensation or welfare
benefits.

YOU CAN GET FOOD STAMPS IF:

A) your total assets are not
more than $2,000 (or $3,000 if some-
one in your household is 60 years or
older). This includes cash, bank ac-
counts, stock and savings bonds, but
NOT your home and the land it's on,
furniture, wedding rings, farm or
business property, nor a car worth
$4,500 or less.

B) your household's total average
monthly income, before taxes or house-
hold expenses are deducted, is not
more than:

NUMBER OF PEOPLE
IN HOUSEHOLD:

GROSS AVERAGE
MONTHLY INCOME:

$581
$785
$988
$1,192
$1,396
$1,399

(These income limits do not apply

if someone in your household is:

60 years or older; or on SSI or
Social Security Disability or 100%
Veteran's Disability benefits. Then,
household shelter expenses and the
medical bills of the aged or dis-
abled person are considered for
eligibility.)

Day Care

1. The staff members work together
and consider the children's well-
being of paramount importance.
2. Personal habits, character and
conduct of the staff provide a desir-
able model for the children to emulate.

ARE THE NEEDS OF THE FAMILY CONSIDERED
IN THE PROGRAM OF THE DAY CARE CENTER?

1. The staff is sensitive to and
understands the differences in the
lifestyles of families.

2. There is on-going communication
between staff and family.

3. The center provides opportunity
for parents to meet together and
meet with staff.

4. The staff has access to and
knows community services and re-
sources so it can refer family mem-
bers as the need arises.

5. In centers which receive public
funds, social workers provide coun-
seling around the child's adjustment
to the program, the parent's child
rearing role and the utilization of
the day care program.

EVEN IF YOU:

You can apply for Food Stamps at
one of the Buffalo offices or at a
suburban office.

you must show your sponsor's wage

year's IRS tax return.

If you qualify for Food Stamps, you
will get them within 30 days of the
date your signed application is re-
ceived by the Food Stamps office.

FOR EMERGENCY FOOD NEEDS:

If your income for the month you
apply is $150 or less and your total
assets are worth $100 or less, you may
be able to get expedited service and
get your Food Stamps within 5 days by
just showing your personal identifica-
