CHILD BIRTH ALTERNATIVES

NEW CHILDBIRTH ALTERNATIVE IN
BUFFALO

by Sharon Green

The Women's Movement has changed
many aspects of our lives, not the
least of which is childbirth prac-
tices. Recent evidence of such
change is the Maternal-Newborn
Nursing Service, a new concept for
women giving birth in Buffalo area
hospitals.

The brainchild of Women's Health
Nurse Practitioner Trudy Stern,
M.N.N.S. allows healthy women and
their babies to be discharged 6-12
hours after birth. In recent
years, women have become more vo-
cal about having some control over
their birth experiences and about
choosing what procedures they want
and which ones they don't want.

More and more women are realizing
that childbirth is a natural
process, rather than an illness,
which doesn't always occur in a
hospital. However, since home-
birth isn't a completely safe
choice in Buffalo at this time,
M.N.N.S. can provide the next best
thing.

Stern, who has a Bachelor of
Science in Nursing and a Master's
in Women's Health, and who has
given birth herself, feels that
hers is an important and innovative
service. Not only does it provide
a chance to get newborns home and
integrated into the family routine
as soon as possible, it also greatly
lessens the mother's separation
from her other child(ren) at home. 
Another service that M.N.N.S.
provides is “non-separation” nursery
care at the bedside after
birth. A private nurse assumes
responsibilities for the newborn,

GETTING GOOD INFO

It is no secret that the wo-
man of today wants resources at
her fingertips. Sometimes the de-
sire to know something is blocked
by not knowing how to get more in-
formation or who to contact. If
it's government agencies or legis-
lators or pamphlets that are needed,
the following list might be helpful:

THE WOMEN'S BUREAU - this agency
reports on women in the labor force
and addresses their needs and con-
cerns. Its reports are free for
the asking: U.S. Dept. of Labor,
Office of the Secretary, Women's
Bureau, Washington, D.C. 20210

CONSUMER INFORMATION CATALOGUE
offers free pamphlets at modest
fees. Topics include careers,
education, health, food, small
business, travel, etc. Consumer
Information Center, P.O. Box 100,
Pueblo, CO 81002

CONSUMER RESOURCE HANDBOOK helps
you locate the best sources of as-
sistance offered by businesses, in-
dustry groups, government, media
and voluntary groups. Consumer
Information Center, Dept. 532 G,
Pueblo, CO 81009

CONSUMERS GUIDE TO THE FDA lists
what the Food and Drug Administration
can do by law, how to comment on
proposed regulations, how to petition
the FDA and what publications are
offered to the public. FDA, 599
Delaware Ave., Buffalo, NY 14202

GOVERNMENT - if you have questions
concerning who your county, state
or federal legislators are and how
to contact them or any government
agencies:

ERIE COUNTY - 846-6392

NEW YORK STATE - 847-3131

FEDERAL INFO CENTER - 846-4010 (also
info for foreign embassies.)

STATE AGENCIES - if you have had
problems connected with a government
agency and need a “people's agent"
contact our local ombudsman:

Se'cy of State Gail Shaffer, NYS
Ombudsman, 162 Washington Ave.,
Albany, NY 12231. She serves all
of western New York. You may also
request a free Directory of State
Services.

MAKING COMPLAINTS

If you have a complaint, a few
suggestions may help. Make sure
you have contacted the right person
or agency. If your complaint only
involves the county, contact only
them. List your complaint intel-
ligently. Be as brief as possible
without omitting essentials. If
you have trouble expressing yourself
on paper, ask a friend to help.
Learn as much as you can about your
particular problem so that, when
you are contacted by your legislator
or agency, you can discuss it in
detail, if requested.

Once contacted, do not lose your
temper. You risk offending those
who wish to help. This cannot be
stressed enough, particularly if you
wish to participate in hearings.

If you do not receive a proper
reply within a reasonable time,
follow up until you do. A phone
call might work. By all means, try
another source if the first did not
correct the problem.

at the mother's side, in the hospi-
tal. This eliminates the routine
separation of the baby in a "re-
covery-observation" nursery in
the first hours after birth in
the hospital. This “non-separation”
service is an attractive option
for those parents who want to bond
with their infant for more than
the usual short time allowed in a
busy hospital.

Needless to say, in order to
qualify for this service, both
mother and infant must be within
normal limits and must be stable
after birth. If there were any
immediate problems, or even any
suspicion of a problem, they wouldn't
be taken on as M.N.N.S. clients.
Another eligibility criterion is
that another adult, be it husband,
friend or mother, must be available
to help out the woman during the
postpartum period at home.

Along with her partner Linda
Verby, R.N., B.S.N., Stern offers
an “Early Discharge Package."

Three visits are included: The
first is presence during and for
a few hours after the birth, the
second occurs the first day at
home, the third is three days later.
During this final visit, they per-
form the PKU test on the newborn
(required by N.Y.S. law), as well
as any other laboratory tests the
pediatrician may request. They are
also interested in helping women
to negotiate any special circum-
stances that necessitate home
nursing care during pregnancy.

Up to now, they've practiced
at Children's Hospital in Buffalo.
They are in the process of alerting
other area hospitals to the avail-
ability of their nursing services,
specifically related to non-separa-
tion, early discharge and follow-
up. Also, they are available to
consult with any physician in the
area who may have clients interested
in early discharge.

The cost of the M.N.N.S. package
is about $200.00, which is consid-
erably lower than the cost of a
2-3 day hospital stay. This ser-
vice is covered by some area in-
surance companies (check with
yours if you are interested). If
you or any pregnant woman you know
would like to know more about
M.N.N.S., contact Trudy Stern at
883-8497, or Linda Verby at 837-
0678.

in a Buffalo-area hospital prompted
her decision to give birth to her
second child at home, assisted by
a nurse-midwife.
