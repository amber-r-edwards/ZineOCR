Movement To Light  
(for Susan)  

In the March rain it is difficult to see ahead or behind--  

we look sideways at each house we pass,  
wondering if perhaps it is our own.  

From time to time the hill opens before us  
and we are listening  

for the sounds of our own voices  

in the next town--  
the stillness is so strange.  

We part at the first stoplight;  
I am walking backwards, to see  
if you will turn  

and the night inhales you.  

Houses hum,  

waiting for dawn,  

eyes boarded in.  

The cold presses into my feet.  

Soon will come the random explosion of Saturday traffic,  

the sweeping and scowling,  
walking with a purpose  
too irregular for the heart to beat to;  
Now the trees lean into the hollow wind.  
Light danced through these woods last month--  
we danced too, shuffling our feet  
through the jewels of snow  
till we were weak with happiness.  
Now I am uncertain--  

the branches are so naked  

the black air is thick  

the stillness swallows my breathing.  

Entering the house,  

I find brown leaves from November on the carpet;  
The bed is filled with you, curled in sleep.  

The martins’ chortle in the trees,  

the wind picks up,  

a tail-less cat, creeping--  

oh my friend,  

the eyeless dawn is speeding closer,  

and my heart beats too quickly.

Pruning  

The crabapple trees wild with neglect  
scrape the car and my mind  

uncovering raw metal and memories  

of planting a relationship and crabapples  

on an early May day.  

The winding driveway  

no longer leads to you  
but to the thick oak door  
and the cool foyer.  

The door heavier than memory  
needs oiling.  

You never labeled cans  

which now sit idle  

lining your workbench.  

The hardware clerk,  
consciously avoiding my face,  
helps me label my need  

by reviewing his recollections  
of your purchases.  

Longing for your touch,  
I sit before the hearth  
you crafted.  

I glance at our picture on the mantle--  
the last visual.  

I put the picture neatly away  

in an old shoe box.  

Taking one more look at us  

so unrealistically young,  
I place the lid uncomfortably  

down upon us.
