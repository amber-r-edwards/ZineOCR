LEER

Continuance

an old person

lies in my grandmother's bed
dying at will

why are we plaguing her
with questions?

even if she recovers

she cannot stand.

this is the first step, only
though you've lost your face
your sight remains

when I grasp your hand

you know me.

have they asked you
why you will not sit
you do not eat

it isn't the illness.

puppet's head
on the pillows
do the blankets camouflage
a body or not.

you have two voices

the child voice whines for nurse
the other talks to granddaughter
who coaxes you back with stories
alternately prodding and
revealing:

sisters, plants and babies

not even the weather

that leaves you out.

remember grandmother's
large bones and pinned up
hair, I ask my sister.

"Do you remember
the fourth of July?"

she wouldn't take us

to the fireworks.

you were too young,

I tell her.

her bags of lace

her box of chocolates

all our drawings on the bookcase?

later I hear she's in the hospital

again.

getting stronger to please
the doctors

we are pleased

can I go home now?

she asks, the I.V. dripping
from the tube.

no dear

you'll be ready soon

you'll go when you're ready.

REVERIE

Child, let me be,
there is nothing the matter with me!

Let me enjoy the quiet moments
indulging in fond memories.

You worry that I seem far away
but I am not escaping from you.
You say that I'm pensive and silent,
either with a smile or a tear.

My dearest child, let me be!

After all the years of comings and goings,

I'm delighted to be left with moments
to just reminisce,

and it is a luxury

beyond any telling

to let those old memories

parade once again just for me.

WOMAN OF OPPRESSION

copyright 1982 dolores rossi script

Today relieved
I saw myself in hope,
the facing a
reflection of a woman's misery
that will surely
black circled eyes, age you
time brutally beyond
sagging your years.
Can they
heal the heatless
yellow framed hours you
spent prematurely before you
white whispy hair?
A destitute case
caught on the door
before the onslaught
when they came
for "the public system".
Woman, I looked into your face
to see your warmth,
your light
and recognized
myself.
Sixty-one years old they said you were,
Aged by your lot,
stripped of your last shred
of dignity
so "they"
could duly
capitalize on it.
Alone,
naked,
deprived,

All you can get
to wet your dry lips
are crackers
and $.64
swollen orbs, and in
the name of God
you only have
tears sent out to the
wilderness and never
returned. "Sorry, lady,
put it back."

No one hears.

Count again

Maybe you hoped
they were searching
every funeral pocket
as I did. Maybe
a miracle will produce
one penny.
Reality says
fear not!
You leave
in the middle of a supermarket
where plenty,
happy,
fat, contented people
pick out items and
wait for
unthinkingly
toss them into their
carts.

This first appeared in "Serb World Magazine", Vol. 3 #3, 1982.

It's a treat to sit down and remember
each and every one of you at my ease;
the mischief, the laughter,

the problems, the crises,

but, foremost, the love

that helped us survive the pains

of our growing-up years.

Why I'm made to feel now

that it requires any explaining?

Would society have been better served
if, instead of staying at home,

I would have been to direct

my feminine intellect

to some other loftier pursuit?

To be carrying a child
was to be touched by Nature,

by heaven and earth;

to feel part angel, part vixen, all woman.
How lucky I was then

to need no other explanation

than God sent these children to me.

But you are right, my dear child,

there's yet much to accomplish,

and this is not the time to idle by the hour
seemingly content in this reverie.

Hush, no more words out of you.

You've convinced me, dear child,

let me join you.

It may well be that in the world out there,
there is a place for me.
