WOMEN AND POVERTY

In early June, New York State's
Division for Women established by
Governor Cuomo, held public hearings
throughout the state to discuss women
and poverty. At C.C.C. City Campus
on June 5, New York's Secretary of
State Gail Shaffer said, "More women
are falling below the poverty level...
In the last decade, women have fared
worse instead of better."

To prove this, the following
statistics were cited: 42% of all
Buffalo households headed by women
live in poverty; 17% of all Buffalo
families live in poverty; and nearly
70% of all Erie County's poor child-
ren live in households headed by women.

According to Dale Taylor of For-
estville, "It's not the feminization
of poverty, but the 'pauperization’
of women."

FEEDING

The New York State Health Depart-
ment has proposed new regulations
which would compel hospitals in the
State to encourage new mothers to
breastfeed their babies. These pro-
posed rules would demand that NYS
hospitals provide both instruction
and assistance in breastfeeding to
their maternity patients.

According to Health Department
spokesperson Peter Slocum, not only
do some hospitals not encourage nur-
sing, some even discourage it by
either adhering to strict schedules
which do not allow babies to nurse
on demand, or by giving women anti-
lactation drugs.

According to a 1982 survey of
New York City hospitals, the lowest
rate of breastfeeding mothers (only
45.1%) was found in municipal hos-
pitals that serve the poor. The
national average is...

TO YOUR HEALTH...

+++Tuesday, May 22, the U.S. Senate
unanimously passed a resolution cal-
ling for national standards for re-
viewing disability claims. Rather
than cutting off benefits during
the appeal process, the measure
would continue funding which was
considered “more humane" than an
abrupt cut-off. If the claimant
loses the appeal he or she would
have to pay any monies back, how-
ever. Senator Cohen, in speaking
about the Reagan administration's
reviews of disability claims begun
in 1981, said since March of 1981,
"more than 470,000 beneficiaries
have been disqualified, but more
than 160,000 people have been re-
instated after appeal", according
to the Buffalo News...

++. A new procedure, called chorion
biopsy, for detecting chromosome
damage in a fetus indicating, for
instance, Down's Syndrome, has been
linked to a high incidence of mis-
carriages, according to Dr. Mahoney
of Yale University. This procedure
was thought to be a great break-
through in pre-natal diagnosis be-
cause it can be performed as early
as the eighth or ninth week of
pregnancy. The other available
technique, called amniocentesis,
cannot be performed until at
least the 16th week. The early
detection of Down's Syndrome or
other chromosomal damage makes
the choice to abort the fetus
safer and easier on the mother.
However, 3 to 10 percent of women
who had the chorion biopsy in a
study of 500 women, subsequently
miscarried the fetus. The miscar-
riage rate for amniocentesis is
one in every 300 to 400...

Punishment for sex-abuse crimes

supposed to suppress the sex drive

has also come under attack by some
for its use on women as a contra-

++- The pain-relieving ingredient in
Motrin, called Ibuprofen, will soon
be available over-the-counter at
drug stores. Ibuprofen is a non-
steroid, anti-inflammatory drug,
with pain-relieving properties simi-
lar to Aspirin. It will be marketed
under trade names Nuprin and Advil.
The warnings are that it will be
more expensive than aspirin but not
necessarily more effective, except
perhaps for menstrual cramps, and
that while not aspirin, those who
are sensitive to aspirin will likely
be sensitive to it. If you are
allergic to aspirin, you are likely
allergic to it...
