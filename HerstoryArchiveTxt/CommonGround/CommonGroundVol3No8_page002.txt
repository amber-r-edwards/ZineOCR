The Women’s
Movement

in Buffalo:

DEAD OR
ALIVE?

by Judith Geer

A panel discussion entitled "The
Women's Movement in Buffalo - Dead or
Alive?" was presented as part of the
International Women's Day program at
the YWCA on Franklin Street, Saturday
March 9th. Five panelists from var-
ious local organizations spoke, and
Nancy Wilkins, Public Relations Di-
rector for the YWCA moderated.

The panel members represented
diverse elements of the activist
community and as such each one
brought her own perspective of "life
in Buffalo" for her own particular
group. The comments these five
women made ranged from just this
side of eulogizing the course of
the women's movement to expressing
profound hope and faith that women
activists are prevailing against
fierce personal and governmental
odds and are even gaining in visi-
bility and numbers.

The panelists were Lee Lyons,
Executive Director of the YWCA;

Jo Osborne of Planned Parenthood;
Debbie Abrams, co-chair of the Stu-
dent Association of the State Uni-
versity (SASU) Women's Caucus; Rosa
Gibson of Community Action Informa-
tion Center; and Ruth Geller of
WAND (Women's Action for Nuclear
Disarmament). After all the speakers
completed their presentations, the
floor was opened for comments or
questions from the audience. These
remarks were unusually articulate
and revealed a depth of enthusiasm
which underscored the upbeat senti-
ments expressed by panelists Debbie
and Ruth that the women's movement
is not dead in Buffalo at all but
only, as Debbie said, "diverted for
the moment." An audience member
commented that women's groups have
been working in Buffalo for years
but we've "lost our history - which
happens to women all the time."

Planned Parenthood's Jo Osborne,
in remarks packed with information
and delivered with verve and inten-
sity expressed the need for women
to keep speaking out, "telling our
own stories" in order to retain the
abortion rights won in 1973 with
Roe vs. Wade. She feels that the
women's movement now is centered
around the abortion issue. She said
that even though the majority of
Americans favor a woman's right to
abortion, we've "lost control of

of Dunkirk, the Caroline Skinner
Twing Community Service Award.

Now in its seventh year, the
Women's Achievement Award campaign
and celebration is one of the most
successful outgrowths of the current
women's movement in New York State.
Since 1970, a vigorous core of fem-
inists - never a large number but
always dedicated to improving the
status of women in their area -
have been actively working to over-
come various obstacles to full equal-
ity for women in their immediate
neighborhood.

Led by the Northern Chautauqua
County NOW chapter - one of the old-

est and longest-lived in the nation,
feminists participated in

the campaign for a state ERA in 1975,
in the national ERA campaign for

nearly ten years, in local and na-
tional efforts to maintain the con-
stitutional right to choose abortion;
and national election

in local, state, and na-
tional lobbying efforts on such
issues as equal divorce law re-
form, aid to displaced homemakers,
and the Title IX Education Act.

In addition, they worked
to aid area women who were victims
of sexual discrimination, including
in many cases sexual harassment, in
their employment situations.

By the late 1970s, two ideas had
begun to recur in Northern Chautauqua
County feminist planning: how to
raise more money for badly needed
services to women in the area, and
the need for greater recognition of
the contribution of the area's women
to the good of the community and to
its professional activities. The
idea of an annual awards and fund-
raising event had been talked of
several times, but, because of the
usual pressures of many things to do
all at once, it had not yet been
implemented.

Then, in 1978, a dynamic, ener-
getic, and talented young woman came
to Fredonia and immediately hooked
into the local feminist network.

She was JoAnne Fischer, and in her
immediate past experience in Phila-
delphia, as an officer of the Na-
tional Women's Health Network, she
