EMMA IS...

This month we are introducing a  
Supporter Plan in cooperation with the  
Common Ground Collective. There are  
two types of Supporter Plans available.  
One is a $15.00 contribution that  
entitles you to a one-year 10% discount  
on all taxable purchases at EMMA, and a  
one-year membership in the lending  
library. The other plan is a $25.00  
contribution that includes the 10%  
discount, the lending library mem-  
bership, and a one-year subscription to  
Common Ground.

When you make your contribution,  
you will be given a "Supporter Plan  
Membership" card. Your contribution to  
this plan is tax deductible for you,  

“and it is an important way that you can  
help to support EMMA and COMMON GROUND.  
When you purchase your card we will ask  
you to indicate your special areas of  
interest - and we will work to improve  
what we offer in these areas. You can  
purchase your Supporter Plan membership  
card at EMMA, or mail in the order form  
that is in Common Ground.

Consider giving a Supporter Plan  
membership as a gift for a friend. If  

you are giving to someone who does not  

already have a subscription to Common  

Ground, give her the combination card!  

This plan is an important way that you  

can support both EMMA and COMMON  

GROUND, and will also help us serve you  

better.

The Supporter Plan will be offered  
on an ongoing basis, but we hope that  
you will take advantage of this plan  
for your holiday shopping! We are  
aware that many women have been disap-  
pointed in recent months to see the  
symptoms of our financial difficulties  
empty shelves. Now, and over the  
next few months, we know you will be  
pleasantly surprised to see evidence of  
revitalization at EMMA. Common Ground  
needs to receive about 100 new  
subscriptions in the near future in  
order to remain intact. We urge you to  
use this plan to help make this  
valuable resource a continuing service  
in our women's community.

This fall you will find that our  
selection in every area is getting  
stronger. We have a good selection of  
books - some old favorites and some new  
titles - for your own enjoyment or for  
gift-giving. Ruth Geller's new novel  

Triangles is one of our many new spe-  
cial features.

to a one-year 10% discount at EMMA,  
Library.  
well. Your contribution  

payable to EMMA, and mail  

In addition to many favorite  
records and tapes, we are featuring two  
new albums: Holly Near's “Sing to Me  
the Dream" with Inti-Illimani, and Kay EMMA  
Gardner's "A Rainbow Path." Holly's  
album is a lively collection of  
Central-American music, both instrumen-  
tal and Spanish lyric selections.

Kay's album  
when she was here  
months ago;  
music with each piece focusing on each  
of the body chakras.

Our button and bumper sticker  
collection offers a wide selection of  

in concert several  

is one that she spoke of  

it is an album of healing  

and open when it should be.  
extremely perturbed by this, and know  
that many women in the community find  
it very frustrating to come to EMMA and  
find her dark and closed. We are  
working very diligently to correct this  
situation, but the only way we are  

We are  

ways for you to “state your mind!" We are featuring items from the Seneca  
Women's Peace Encampment, and part of  
the proceeds for these items helps to  
support the Encampment.

We have titles in  

new our  
children's literature - attractive and  
engaging stories for youngsters that  
entertain and inform. No More Secrets  

for Me is an example of a story that  
helps a youngster understand sexual  
abuse, and how they can help prevent  
this from happening to them.

We are particularly excited about  
our 1985 women's calendar selection.  
Many of the special feature calendars  
of previous years are here again  
“Heroines", the "Women Writer's Desk  
Calendar", and “The Women's Almanac."  
We also have a good selection of new  
calendars - for example there is a won-  
derful Nicole Hollander calendar that  
will tickle your fancy all year long!

On a more somber note, we have  
experienced some harassment at EMMA in  
the past several weeks - males who are  
verbally abusive and have threatened  
physical violence. We have taken  
several precautions as a result that  
you may encounter when you visit EMMA.  
When one of us is in the store alone,  
we keep the door locked and only open  
it for someone who we are sure is  
coming in for a legitimate purpose. If  
you arrive and find the door locked,  
please knock! Also, several of us are  
having our pet dogs accompany us - some  
of these are noisy but will only pre-  
sent a threat if threatened, and they  
will mostly ignore you or make friends  
within a few minutes - as you wish. We  
appreciate your understanding of these  
inconveniences.

Another inconvenience that we are  
aware of is that we are having some  
difficulty in keeping the store staffed.

“HELPING HIM DOESN'T  
HAVE TO MEAN TURNING  
YOUR BACK ON HER.

Some people only give financial  
support to the large, well-known  
charities. That's fine, but there  
are also a lot of small agencies pro-  
viding vital aid to a lot  
And United Way helps  
Because it helps not just the  
well-known causes, but those people  
you wouldn't turn your back on  

if you knew how much they really  
needed your help.

Thanks to you. It  
works for all of us.
