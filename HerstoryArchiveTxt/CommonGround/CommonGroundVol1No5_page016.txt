land.  
you are joyous  
like a woman  

against horizon  

rich red cliffs  

waiting to be cradled  

as sun sets  
I reach out  

run my hands through your earth  

evening's cool wind  

carries message  

sand washing over my body  

each cell of skin  
pinched  

softly  
I shiver in awe  
your power  

I rest for night  

carve my bed in red sand  
my body a crescent moon  

that mirrors  
my sister above  

she rises to stars  

bathing light  

Sappho  

Sappho is  

my secret lover  

when the stars bend to kiss  

her cheek she presses  

the strings of her golden lyre writing  
the poetry that I call my own

Drops  

Teardrops  
Raindrops  
Waterdrops  
Blood drops  
Sometimes I drop too.

Once upon an American Home afternoon we drank coffee and talked Spock, the baby one,  

But then we were liberated: only the retarded womaned the vacuum cleaner.  

We left The World to Turn into deadlines and neurotic overseers whom we didn't even love.  

You're on Husband #2; the first couldn't adjust enough.  

I'm struggling with guilt, sensing family needs I'm too drained to meet.  

Her home is only a house where people sleep, leave laundry, and grab a bite to eat.  

No one is around to wind the cuckoo clock.  

Ecologists berate our dishwashers and clothes dryers, but we need them.  
Economists urge us to grow vegetable gardens, but who has the time?  
Her parents phone their miseries into suicide control centers;  

Your teenagers rap with hot-line listeners;  

We direct our diminished husbands to professional soothers;  

And sometimes, especially when I'm haunted by the speedreading eyes of my Three Bearless children  

—— NOW forgive me —- I can't help wondering  

What was so terribly wrong with that gingerbread man I used to bake?  

Bouquet  

today I decided that  

once in my life I can afford  
a dozen long-stemmed  
American Beauty roses.  

at least once  

in my life to feel  

utterly connected/utterly  
at peace, simple as a child  
at mother's breast, this  
red rose/my love is like

Untitled  

I need to be  
in somebody's eyes  
I need  

I gave my eyes  

to everybody  

and now  

I cannot look  

at myself  

I  

have taken  
everything I got  

and given it  

to the world  

and now  

I have no bread to eat  

that falls down upon us and beyond  
reaching to the depths  
of river's roaring music  
its flow  
warm  
wet  
crease in your valley  
here life breathes freely  
renewed  
secrets unfold  
I feel your strength  
celebrate the great expanse  
of our vision  
our struggle  
we are one

deep red roses standing in a  
crystal vase, their fragrance an  
aura of sweetness/let those  
who have senses know the joy  
of these once-in-a-lifetime roses  
how they open, open to each other  
their golden centers  
I am  
just  
alone.

and from the surprising lumps of flesh, the bottom,  
as she bends over and reaches for a toiletry,  
dangles a string, neatly, exactly mid-center,  

just below a very well-defined crevice,  

a white string, about five inches in length,  
seemingly out of nowhere but in actuality springing  
from the real center of a woman's life,  

hanging innocently, elaborating the nude back-view,  
backside, of this woman,  

in a locker room
