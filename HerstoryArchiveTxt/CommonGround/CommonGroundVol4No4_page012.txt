review of PLENTY

Director: Fred Schepisi

Starring: Meryl Streep, Charles
Dance, John Gielgud,
Sting, Tracey Ullman

The night after I saw PLENTY I
didn't sleep well. I'm not sure
whether it was entirely due to the
troubling theme and searing perfor-
mances of the movie or to the late
(and very fried) supper I'd eaten,
but PLENTY aroused feelings about
the nature of illusion and hope
which could not easily be tossed a-
side. In fact, after the movie,
several members of the audience
left in disgust, one man saying it
was the worst film he'd ever seen.
They had apparently simply wanted
to be entertained, something PLENTY
was not intended to do.

Let me say first of all, that
this is a gem of a movie with an
outstanding David Hare screenplay
and perfect performances by all the
actors, especially Meryl Streep,
one of the wonders of the cinematic
world. The plot - such as it is -
is secondary to the inner journey of
Susan Traherne (Streep), an English-
woman of immense fortitude. She
works as a resistance fighter in
France during World War II where she
has a brief affair with a fellow
fighter for truth, justice and the
English Way of Life. When he leaves
her abruptly he leaves his gold cuff-
links as a remembrance. She carries
them with her constantly thereafter,
and they become her talisman, her
link with a meaningful past and her
hope for a better life.

After the war, Susan returns to
a Britain suddenly awash with post-
war money and materialism. Susan is
brighter than most and still clings
to her wartime standards of creating
a meaningful world, although she
admits that she doesn't know how to
go about this. All she can do is
remain outspoken in an effort to be
true to herself. She wants to have
a child, but not a husband, so she
asks a working-class acquaintance
(Sting) for assistance. They try for
18 months, but no conception occurs.
Incidentally, all the lovemaking in
the film is done with the characters
fully clothed; even symbolically
nothing can be "exposed" or made
vulnerable for fear that this
carefully patterned society would
collapse. Sterility, cover-ups,
deceptions abound as Susan struggles
against her frequent and more brutal
outbursts of temper designed to
rattle the oppressive complacency of
the post-war British environment in
which she feels trapped.

DICKENS

In gay culture, the traditionals
are the outrageously gay--"the fairy
queens, transvestites, bulldykes--
people who congregate in gay bars,
literary salons, the theater, port
cities, tattoo parlors, coffee houses
during the time of Queen Anne in
England. “In our society, they're the
people who know how to put together
a Halloween parade, hold a grand ball,
give out prizes to the most outrageous-
ly dressed.” They might include “a
woman wearing 10 earrings--all in one
ear, of course," people with tattoos,
permanent or temporary, or people
dressed as animals, plants, trees,
World War II soldiers, Grahn said.

Listening to her, I get a vision
that I can only hang onto in fits and
starts, because it's so enormous.
"Think of history as a long wave,"
she said, and I try to. I try to re-
member that our time is not the only
time, the special time, the defini-
tive time. I try to remember that
patterns will repeat, break up, and
reform in different but similar ways
--as they've done before. I try to
remember that I can be, in the old
hippie phrase, part of the problem
--or part of the solution.

After one such outburst, Susan
ends up in a mental hospital. Her
friend, Alice (Tracey Ullman) calls
Susan's former lover, a diplomat
named Raymond (Charles Dance) who
marries her “in a moment of weak-
ness - mine,” Susan later says. Of
course, having an outspoken former
mental patient for a wife is anathema
for career advancement, especially
after a strange dinner party given
by Susan and Raymond while the Suez
crisis is in full tilt. Susan is
desperately opposed to the British
invasion of Egypt and the other
guests either don't care or are in
favor of it. Susan is dressed
barely in a black strapless gown.
Part-way through this rocky evening
she complains of being cold and hugs
herself for warmth. She has quite
literally been frozen out of the
group. Darwin (Gielgud), an older
British diplomat in attendance at
this party, announces he's resigning
from the foreign service because of
the untenable position in which his
government has placed him with its
deceptive attitude during the Suez
crisis. Susan is thrilled with the
announcement and animatedly invites
everyone to eat a second dinner be-
cause "we have plenty." But no one
moves to accept her offer.

The Suez crisis epitomized the
folly and arrogance of postwar Bri-
tain as it desperately attempted to
manipulate events in the Near East
by force of arms. As this crisis
builds to its sad, hang-dog end, the
“Susan Crisis” builds also,
trying to find meaning to
meaning which somehow
eludes her after the war when her
work with the Resistance ends. This
utter despair is underscored by the
poignancy of a final flashback to the
France she fought for, and provides
a great deal of food for thought.

My thoughts, though, turn to the
man in the theater who burst out with
"this is the worst film I've ever seen."
I think his reaction says more about the
time we live in than about the
movie. We're led to believe today
that if facing reality is too diffi-
cult, it is acceptable to reject it
by denigrating those who want to show
it to us. PLENTY looks inside society
and individuals to find the cause of
sorrow. This is not exactly a
new idea, but presented with the con-
viction and bite of all the artists
associated with PLENTY, it can be a
harsh lesson. Set such a creation in
the USA of 1985, and it can be
worse -- it can be a truth which is
too painful to be grasped.

Grahn's vision of how to be part
of the solution is clear. It's nei-
ther separatism nor integration but
a blend. “If you practice separatism
and integration, you bond with people
like yourself, use that bonding as a
home base, and then take it out into
the larger world,” she said. "We
shouldn't say, 'Men have money, money
is bad, women are good, women will
have nothing to do with dirty money.'
When we started lesbian-feminism, we
tried to set up economic insti-
tutions and develop independence.
We tried to reclaim our own history.
I've helped set up three lesbian-
feminist institutions--in politics,
in publishing, in setting up separate
women-only spaces. Every time that
happens, power is taken away from
the mainstream and put into the hands
of a group of ordinary people."

She stressed that we must do our
own naming, or lose what we've built.
“I expect that after I die, people
will read my work and say I was
really married to a man named George
and never loved women at all," Grahn
said. "This happened to Emily Dick-
inson, it happened to Gertrude Stein
--it'll happen to me if you let it."

GRAHN CONT...

it happens to the wrathful
rhythm of a Sumerian chant--
“of the unkempt realm," in the
words of the poem. To avoid
misunderstanding -- in Ancient
Mirror:

womanhood, Merlin
Sumer, the
most ancient literary civil-
ization on record" and about
metaphor and simile in Sumerian
epic poetry which, read aloud,
becomes a forcefully fertile
(vol. 2, New Sibylline Books,
1979, pp. 33, 36). During
the question and answer period,
responding to a woman who had
traveled 100 miles to hear
the wild cherry poem aloud a
third time, Grahn said,
"I trust now that it's going to
be OK."

Stone writes

Asserting matter-of-factly
the importance of her growing
stick-to-itiveness. No doubt
considerable pressure mounts
against a woman who dares to
write, "Every one you ever were
will die while you go down, go
down, go down on me." This woman
writes of "stormy regions": she
writes of "thistles in my fur."

My name is shadow of the wolf
And,

My name is naked of expectations
And,

I of the snarled hair
the one earring
the brassy metallic nail polish

I am a wild cherry sister*

For me this reading was too short.
I wanted Judy to read on. Some-
times her words echoed forward to me
from the eighth annual (1982)
women's writing workshop directed
by Beverly Tanenhaus at Ithaca
College, Grahn's first teaching job.
This was my second experience
with the workshop, the first having
come in 1980 at Hartwick College
in Oneonta. In 1980, Edward the
dyke-like** Grahn read to the
workshop her common woman poems,
1964-1977, her searching gaze so
searing that some workshop members
turned in their chairs. She read "A Woman
Is Talking To Death.” As she read,
it grew in the consciousness
that one of our workshopmates
was fast dying of cancer and
there to share with us her
journal of journeying to death --
and that in the previous day's
work session, virtually every
participant had rejected this
understanding of this woman's
work. Grahn's words spared the
ignominy.

In the mainstream, she said, people
are still telling flat lies and get-
ting away with it--for instance, that
women writers are marginal.

But don't focus on what they have
done to us, or on the lie they are
telling. Form our own structures,
she said. Make our own markets, our
own ceremonies.

She spoke of the women's worship
services Paula Gunn Allen has started
in Los Angeles, where she and Grahn
live. They embody "cosmic forces
defined in feminine terms," Grahn
said. This makes sense for Paula
Gunn Allen, a member of the Laguna
tribe, "Which has a gyno-center.
The creatrix is Spider Grandmother..."

At the women's services, everyone
who is having her period gets a red
flower and holds it throughout the
worship. "It's a private and public
ritual,” Grahn said. "To see those
women sitting with a red flower gives
value to a woman's period."

“The word worship is really
worth-ship," she said. "It
means 'giving worth to.' If
we give worth to female things,
we give them energy. We ener-
gize them, and energize our-
selves, too."

"And it really, really works,“
she concluded.
