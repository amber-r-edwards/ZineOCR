"Perception of The Future and The  

In an article titled,  
Future of Perception,” Heinz Von  
Foerster says, "The world appears  
to be in the grip of a  
fast-spreading disease, which by  
now, has assumed almost global  
dimensions. In the individual the  
symptoms of the disorder manifest  
themselves by a progressive  
corruption of his faculty to  
perceive, with corrupted language  
being the pathogen, that is, the  
agent that makes the disease so  
highly contagious. Worse, in  
progressive stages of this  
disorder, the afflicted become  
numb, they become less and less  
aware of their affliction."  

This epidemic of Perceptual  
Disorder, spread through the use of  
corrupted language, is especially  
prevalent in the physician-patient  
relationship. Even before you  
enter a doctor's office, language  
creates the reality of the  

encounter.  

Perhaps, like many people,  
you've selected a particular  
physician based on a friend's  

pronouncement that, "S/he is good."  
Surprisingly, such a statement  
contains no information about the  
doctor. Anaesthetized by the  
habitual use of 'good' as a  
recommendation, you may forget that  
'good' is not a property residing  
in a person, but rather, a  
subjective relation between the  
referring friend and the doctor.  
Ironically, the recommendation  
tells you more about your friend  
than the doctor.  

Lesbian/Gay Source  

The National Lesbian/Gay  
Health Foundation Publishes  
the Only National Sourcebook on  
Health Care for Gays and Lesbians  

The National Lesbian/Gay Health  

Foundation (NLGHF) - the oldest  
national lesbian and gay health  
organization - has published the  

second edition of The Sourcebook on  
Lesbian/Gay Health Care. The  
Sourcebook is the only  
comprehensive directory and  
resource book for lesbians and gay  
men. It contains more than 2,000  
listings of doctors, clinics,  
counseling services and research  
centers that specialize in lesbian  
and gay health care, as well as 42  
articles by leading experts on  
lesbian and gay health issues. The  
Sourcebook directory covers every  
state in the United States as well  
as Canada, Switzerland and the  
United Kingdom.  

"While The Sourcebook includes  
the most comprehensive information  
and listing of doctors and clinics  
treating people with AIDS," said  
Ellen Ratner, President of the  
NLGHF, "this publication goes far  

beyond AIDS. The directory  
provides information on every  
conceivable health issue that a  
lesbian or gay might confront; such  

as psychotherapy, support groups,  

chemical dependency and other  
addictions, rape counseling,  
menstrual disorders, holistic  
treatment, and plain old basic  

preventive health care."  

The articles contained in The  
Sourcebook are written by world  
renowned health care experts on  
major health and social issues  
facing the lesbian and gay  
community, which makes it one of  
the richest academic resources on  
lesbian and gay health issues ever  
published. Previously unavailable  
surveys and analyses are presented  
for the first time on issues such  
as substance abuse, mental health,  
AIDS, sexuality and gay and lesbian  
families.  

"The articles contained in The  

Sourcebook represent a highly  
intellectual and objective  
investigation into the crucial  

health problems facing the lesbian  
and gay community," explained  
Michael Shernoff, a co-editor of  

The Sourcebook. "We've needed an  
interdisciplinary volume of this  
magnitude for a long time. It's an  
important step toward our goal of  
equal access to quality health care  
for all people. The articles in  
The Sourcebook are not gay and  
lesbian health 101. They were  
chosen for the lesbian and gay  
consumer of health services as well  
as for the professional seeking  
state-of-the-art information  
relevant to his or her patients."  

"This book is a must," said  
William A. Scott, a co-editor.  
"Being gay or lesbian doesn't mean  
you have to suffer more than any  
other segment of the population,  
either physically or  
psychologically. The Sourcebook  
lets you know where to go to get  
basic or specialized health care,"  
he added.  

The Sourcebook, which is sold for  
$14.00, was edited by Michael  
Shernoff, ACSW, and William A.  
Scott, CSW, ACP. It is available  
in bookstores across the country or  

by contacting the NLGHF, PO Box  
65472, Washington, D.C. 20035,

WELLSPRING:  

How Language Can Make You Sick  

by Madeline Poe  

Once in the doctor's office,  
waiting several hours to be seen,  
you may sense the significance of  
the word 'patient' used to describe  
the person on the other side of the  

stethoscope. Webster's New World  
Dictionary defines patient as:  

bearing or enduring pain, trouble,  
etc. without complaining, losing  
self-control, making a disturbance.  
Calmly tolerating delays, confusion  
and inefficiency, etc.  

Subsequent to establishing a  
relationship with a doctor, the way  
in which you express that  
relationship could have  
implications for the quality of  
care you will accept from her/him.  
Referring to a doctor by saying "my  

doctor" cultivates a sense of  
possessiveness and personal  
accomplishment. Quite unknowingly,  
through your language, you admit  

the doctor into the realm of your  
own personal competence. Doing so  
might make it more difficult for  

you to be critical of her/his  
performance. Having linguistically  
and conceptually linked the  

doctor's reputation to your own,  
you now have a stake in upholding  
her/him at all costs.  

Of course, patients are not the  
sole transmitters of corrupted  
language. Doctors are skilled  
practitioners of diseased dialogue,  
often injecting their language with  
vague and contradictory messages.  
Patients, already physically ill,  
suffer the routine complication of  
feeling stupid and confused.  
"Medicalese," the multi-syllabic  

language used by the doctor to  

describe your condition,  
concurrently separates physicians  
from patients while assembling the  
collective authority of the medical  
institution to enforce decisions.  
Inquiries by anxious patients are  
frequently dismissed with concrete  
assurances such as, "It's nothing,  
you're fine." It doesn't take a  
patient with an unidentified  
nagging illness long to discover  
that even if you feel sick, you are  
not officially sick until a doctor  
declares a diagnosis.  

Much of doctors’ language  
functions to rule out the ambiguity  
inherent in medicine and create the  
overwhelming impression that the  
doctor is the ultimate judge of the  
state of your health. In fact, it  
is the patient who is the doctor's  

sole source of information  
regarding the subjective experience  
of health and illness. It is  

through the exchange of questions  
and answers between both parties  
that the doctor is able to deduce a  
probable cause for a condition.  
The reality of our experience is  
constructed by the language we use.  
A vital prescription for improved  

health is the reconstruction of  
language between physicians and  
patients.
