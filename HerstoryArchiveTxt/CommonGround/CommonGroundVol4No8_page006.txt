dirty glass water

walkin home nights  
cold

the dark nights  
black

the hour that is  
still

invis'ble breathin  
and dreams

put to bed

left only of own  
in and out

to be heard  
laborin

1

tall trees

line up like men

with dark faces

like strangers

slippin by

unnoticed

like homeless demons  
slippin

between cars

findin a way to live  
like trees in america  
like trees

like upside down roots  
their hairy branches  
stupidly reachin  
reachin the wrong way  
their tendrils curlin  
off into infinite growth

just for the sake of doin it

like somethin obscene

walkin home

to out my illusions

to rest to sleep

to regulate my breathin'  
to shut off the cable TV  
to dream of makin change  
and the dirty glass water  
that smells up my breath  
in the mornin

it is strange

I didn't drink it

but it comes

a familiar friend

to remind me

where I've been

walkin home

still playin in my ears  
the forever music

of bodies comin together  
explodin

for a brief moment

then bouncin apart  
leavin trails

those voices

tonight their minds  
spinnin off

dimmin to nothin

do they think of me?  
walkin home nights  
still smellin

of them and their

dirty glasses

do they wonder about me?  
the only woman alive  
thinkin feelin

breathin in the breath  
of sleepin breathers

it never stops

the trees follow

me home

wavin their

branches

remember their faces

rather their drinkin habits  
sufferin with them

as you pump the glasses

to the beat of their life stories  
because they tell them

as if you weren't there

as if you weren't listenin

as if this face

floatin’ before them

these hands red from the cold  
splashin up and down

in dirty water

were figments

like pink elephants

comin and goin

here now to haunt you

there not to haunt me

your tired legs  
walkin you home

remind you of your mother

PEN & INK BY DREE RITTENHOUSE

she surely saw her share  
of dirty glass water  
feedin a family of eight  
on meatloaf and

kool-aid

her finger raw

and busy

like cuttin onions

all the time

or peelin potatoes

domesticated fingers

busy fingers

so busy she never talked to you--  
you don’t know her

so you rarely think of her

and walkin home nights

you turn to more immediate memories  
like the dirty glass water

like the trees

like your lover

you turn to your lover

who sleeps

warm from sleep

and distant in dreams

of you? 

you wonder

you can hardly hear him breathin;

but then you can't

hear your own breathin

anymore

you drown each other out  
and driftin off  
you make change  
you wash glasses

you walk home nights  
dreamin of trees

all over america

like something obscene

out there in the mornin  
with you wakin

to visions

of dirty glass water

that sorely needs replacin

Tammy Ryan

LEFTOVERS

I went to Paris

To be away

From you, too.

He loved me, and I loved him  
They weren't enough.

You visited in May

Springtime in Paris was romantic.  
I didn't know how to accept your love  
Yet trusted you wholly.

Now I need love

Don't trust

Wish we had danced

And miss you sometimes.

We did somersaults in the grass  
And I loved you to the tune of "Dancin' With Myself" which I never did again.

Laura and I never went to Cape Cod.

She went to New York when I lost Andrew.

She won't write her pain but calls teasingly from work.  
I thought she understood me

Maybe she needs me.

I never had Susan.

I expected too much.

She had herself

And none to share with me.

Only leftover Man #6

Requests

"Feeling for me" about Andrew

Shared wine in Paris

And introducing me to her family at graduation as her roommate of 1 year  
When she moved out suddenly after 2%.

I wish my father had seen me graduate.  
I don't know if I would have liked him now.  
His father died when he was 13.

My mother didn't sneak to her father for 7  
My father left me his nose, his hands, and

ears before he died.  
his mind.

Hilary was my friend.

She found a good man, a new woman, and my old home,  
I found her cat, her shrink, myself.

I want to find her again.

Nadia sits in her chair, facing me,

I don't always look at her.

I vent

So that I can talk to the rest of the world.  
The wound is open and bleeding.

It can now heal.

There will be a scar.

Was my dream of running away a wound

That therapy was more than I had planned  
That loving again makes me vulnerable

Or that medicine won't cure me? Laura Pest
