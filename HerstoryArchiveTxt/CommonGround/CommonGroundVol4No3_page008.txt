THE WOMEN

“Because my husband owns his own business, things get tight moneywise, so my income is also needed. My mother-in-law, who lives nearby, babysits for us. My husband's hours are flexible, so he can watch the kids if his mother can't, and he can also drive me to work. So we survive."

—Renae Klukowski, a service representative for PANIC distributing in an area department store, with her children Teresa (8 months) and John (2):

"My child is now 11, and she is pretty independent because of our situation (I've been divorced for 7 years). It was more difficult in the beginning when she was 5. We moved into an apartment complex with a daycare center. At that time, she went off to kindergarten for a half day, and then the bus dropped her off at the daycare afterward. She had also gone there before starting kindergarten. When she was about 9 and got too old for the daycare, she started going to a neighbor's after school. Now she’s a latch-key child, and she calls me after she gets home from school. She even does some babysitting of her own. 

So now it works out pretty well. If I have to go out in the evening, she can stay alone, or go to a friend's. I have also developed a series of sitters in our apartment complex. Saturday is for laundry and what little housekeeping I do. I only shop once every two weeks, since there's only two of us. My life is a lot simpler now in some ways, and more complicated in others, since I'm involved in a lot of projects outside the house."
