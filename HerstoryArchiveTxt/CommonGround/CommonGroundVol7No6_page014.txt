ANY CHANCE You DARE TO  
TRY TO EXERCISE your  

Constitutional RIGHTS.  

Baptist Preacher Links Abortion with AIDS, Says  
God Punishes Homosexuals, Pro-Choice Supporters  

Daren Drzymala, who claims to have a degree from Jerry Falwell's Liberty College, is the author of the letter  
shown below, which was placed on the windshields of people attending the pro-choice clergy meeting. The text of  
the letter makes it abundantly clear what Drzymala's real agenda is: to recruit more people to his narrow  
fundamentalist beliefs, and to harass and intimidate anyone who doesn't fall under his definition of "Christian."  
There is no room for religious freedom in Drzymala's little world, and rights for gay and lesbian people are certainly  
out of the question.  

The time for coalition building is now. Leaders of feminist, pro-choice, gay/lesbian and AIDS groups must see  
that we are all in the same boat: under attack from the religious right. It is tempting to dismiss this kind of  
propaganda as the rantings of an obsessed splinter group, but unfortunately, the media give a lot of play to this tiny  
congregation of 25. And many people believe that what they see on TV is the truth. Unfortunate too, is the strong  
support of our mayor for this kind of harassment, and in the bigger picture, the Bush Administration.  

As separate groups, we may find the struggle almost impossible to bear. The opposition has seemingly  
unlimited endurance (although one wonders if these people have to work for a living), and lots of money. The media  
give them more credibility than they deserve.  

AIDS isn't the only issue. Nor is reproductive freedom, feminism, or gay/lesbian rights. They are all tied  
together as personal freedoms that have been won through many years of hard fighting. The religious right hopes to  
divide and conquer anyone who disagrees with them.  

We must work together, and survive.
