The Killing.

It was a bitch rolling out in the pitch black

I tried to straighten out my fuzzy head

With a couple of gulps of last night's incentive
But it wasn't only the cold floor that made me shake
I knew I had but one hour to find that perfect spot
One hour to go

So I hurried and dragged on that old red-checked coat
Mother tried to give to the Goodwill last summer,
And piled into my old Ford

Pulling on my gloves stuck up with burrs

From the last try

As I threw in the old Ithaca and a box of shells

I knew this would be the time

This was it—last chance of this year.

I set my mind—resolute, determined.
This was it

I flew over the highway as did my thoughts.

I could see my tree with its criss-crossed trunk

And its little gnarl

Perfectly suited for sitting

And waiting

Everywhere the leaves were damp and moldy after the early snow
Had melted off leaving that sweet and dank smell

In twenty minutes it would be light

I must find my way silently to my tree

Even through the gloves the bark is rough

As I grab hold to pull myself up

I pull up the Ithaca barrel down

The steel is cold as it brushes against my cheek
When I take practice aim

I position myself comfortably in the crotch of the tree
Then I reach in my pocket pulling out five shells

I insert one, pump it into the chamber

And shove four more into the magazine

I wonder which one will do it

But it's too late to wonder

It's time to watch and wait

Dawn edges past my tree

I can see tracks clearly from my tree

The wind begins to blow

It muffles sounds

So I listen harder—but I hear nothing

For what seems like hours

My seat is sore, and I shift my weight

Suddenly out of the corner of my eye

I catch a movement

I lift my gun to my shoulder but sigh

A small squirrel races across the path chastising the intruder

More minutes pass

It grows colder

Rain begins to fall

And again it is difficult to hear

I wonder if I will hear—see what I must see
A thousand questions

Then I hear a twig snap

I gulp and turn my head

A mocking screech greets my stare
“Get out of here damn it.”
I mutter and throw a bit of bark at a persistent jay

Hours pass—I am wet through—My nose is stuffy—I dare not blow it
I sigh and snuggle closer to the gnarly tree

Perhaps I doze

Then I start imperceptibly

They are there—not twenty yards away

One long-legged buck, not young, at least 12 points

The doe is sweet and shy—confident alongside her mate

Perhaps she's one of many, but she doesn't seem to know or care

I don't move or breathe

The buck turns away to chew some fresh shoots

The doe bends gently—her nose close to his flank

I slowly pull my gun to my shoulder and wait till the doe moves away
From her mate

They still have not seen
