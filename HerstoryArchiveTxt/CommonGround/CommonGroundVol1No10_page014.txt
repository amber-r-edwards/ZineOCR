Question:

Marie Turner, Buffalo:

"Yes, I do. I try not to take any
night courses. However, I've never
been attacked before, so it doesn't
really bother me. It's a shame
that women do have to take precautions
to go out, such as to go to the store
at night."

Kay Lima, Kenmore:

"I don't think that I take extra
precautions. I usually keep my house
locked, and I tell my children to do
the same. I also keep my car locked.
But I don’t walk around fearful. I'm
aware, but not over-aware. I have
confidence that I would be able to
act immediately with that awareness
that I have.

I'm more fearful about my daughter.
I've had a hard time drawing a fine
line between wanting her to be care-
ful, and yet not wanting her to be
too fearful. I think she's more
fearful than I am, but I think that
her fear is helpful. Yet I feel bad
about her sense of great distrust of
men."

Anonymous, Buffalo:

"I definitely do, because I already
was assaulted. I don’t go out alone
at night. If I have to walk to the
campus, I try to get one of my male
friends to go with me. If I don't
have to drive, I try to get someone
to drop me off, rather than drive
alone. Also, I never park in an
underground ramp. When I'm walking,

sexual assault?

I'm constantly aware of who might be
behind me - even in the daylight."

Dewette Aughtry, Buffalo:

"One of the things that I do is to
always look around, especially when
getting out of the car, and when I
have to go in the trunk. Also, I try
not to park in dark places. I rarely
go out alone at night. Also, I al-
ways have my door key ready in my
hand so I don't have to fidget with
my keys at the door.

It's terrible that I have to do
all this. When I think about a wo-
man getting raped, I can't imagine
how a man can do this. How dare he
think that what a woman has is his."

Donna Humphrey, New York City:

"When I'm out, I'm usually aware
of the possibility of all types of
assault, not just sexual. I've dev-
eloped a rapid walk at night. I al-
ways carry something that I can use
as a weapon, such as keys or a letter
opener. I'm careful about going to
secluded places. When I’m walking,
I'm always looking behind me. When
passing an alleyway, I always look
down into it. I've developed an at-
titude of looking mean or tough, so
perhaps someone would think twice
about bothering me.

The whole idea of assault makes me
angry. But the fact that women can
also be subjected to the addition of
sexual assault makes me angrier.

This kind of assault is so debasing."

Anonymous, Buffalo:

"Of course I do. I don’t limit my
activities or destinations, although
I often think I should. At night, I
keep my car doors locked when driving;
when walking, I always carry my keys
so that one key is between each fin-
ger. I've also learned to walk with
a confident air and with my head held
high. Since I've been doing this, I
also notice how often many women walk-
ing around me look quite weak and vul-
nerable - not only because of their
dangerous shoes and confining clothes
but also because of their stance and
walk. Also, I gave up carrying a
purse several years ago; that's
one less reason for someone to
bother me.

Needless to say, I resent having
to always have the fear of rape in
the back of my mind. I am espec-
ially resentful of the fact that
we women take this for granted,
too."

Aisha Adeen-Hasan, Buffalo:
"I take precautions. I gener-
ally don't go out at night and, if
I do, it's rare that I go out alone.
I don't believe in taking
an area that's fairly
I feel that this restricts my
freedom. I'd like to be able to
come and go as I please. But since
there is the threat of violence, a
great deal of my freedom is taken
away."

QUESTION FOR SEPTEMBER'S COMMUNITY

Seven community women began Simple
Gifts in September 1976 as a shelter
for transient women in crisis, af-
filiated with the Catholic Worker
Movement started by Dorothy Day in
1932. These women offered the
‘simple gifts' of food and shelter.

Simple Gifts is dedicated to
building an intentional community
of people wanting to learn and grow
together, based on common values
and shared experiences. Simple
Gifts provides a non-alienating,
supportive and caring atmosphere
for women who are making positive
changes in their lives and have
no place else to go.

Surviving as an all volunteer
community supported shelter for
nearly two years, in 1978, Simple
Gifts began providing 24 hours a
day, seven days a week shelter for
women and their children, with
the addition of 5 paid CETA workers.
There have been as many as 14 women
on staff, in addition to many
volunteers. They can
shelter as many as 450 women and
children a year, and do phone
counseling and referrals for up to
230 women each month.

Simple Gifts is now in a crisis
situation and in need of community
support. Simple Gifts receives no
federal, state or local government

reasonable winter heating bills.
Because of staffing cuts, more com-
munity women are needed to volunteer
time--to answer phones, do trans-
portation, write grants, do fund-
raising, and staff the shelter.

They also need money. As much as
$1000 a month in the winter, not
including salaries, to keep the
shelter open.

Simple Gifts is appealing to
women and men in the community
for support. Women who have been
battered or those who want to make
sure there are options for battered
women, are the only ones who can
keep Simple Gifts open.

Simple Gifts is a vital and very
necessary part of the Western New York
community. Make helping Simple
Gifts a priority of your women's
group or church, and give what you
can of time and/or money. Contribu-
