to. “We owe it to our children,"  
she said, "to see that they don't  
meet discrimination [especially]  
in school. We must give our child-  
ren a positive self-image. If  
they like and respect themselves  
[they will also] like and respect  
others." Weinstein sees this as  
critical for "breaking the chain"  
of prejudice.  

The discussion group was very  
much aware of the difficulty for  
Jews to get the mainstream cul-  
ture in this country to recognize  
the blatantly Christian roots and  
expression of much of public  
life. The participants expressed  
frustration, especially with the  
school system, for appearing to  
be unable to understand that  
Christmas, for instance, with  
decorated trees or Santas and  
Christmas carols is: 1) not a  
generic, areligious holiday, no  
matter how you dress it up and  

2) Hanukkah is not a "Jewish equi-  
valent to Christmas” or the "Jewish  
Christmas."  

Many participants seemed to  
feel that being immersed in the  
Christian culture of the United  
States makes it nearly impossible  
for many people who do not have  
a different perspective to see  
the Christian context of the  
holidays, food preferences, even  
the traditional work-week with  
Sundays off. Their Jewish per-  
spective on these issues gets  
trivialized and often dismissed  
as unimportant. But for a posi-  
tive self-image, a Jewish child  
needs the cultural and religious  
expression of her/his identity  
and one way is through the rituals  
of everyday Jewish life, including  
holy days, dietary preferences  
and dress. That child does not  
need to feel inferior, abnormal  
or shut out of life because what  
is considered normal in the U.S.  
is Christian, at least culturally  
if not religiously. A child who  
tries to maintain a Jewish identity  
in this country has a hard job  
ahead. Parents can facilitate  
this with positive instructions  
to remove blatant Christian  
teachings and activities and by  
standing firmly behind the con-  
cept that maintaining a Jewish  
outlook and identity does not  
mean “you're not playing along"  
or “you are being difficult."  
That child is exercising the  
rights this country is supposed  
to guarantee.  

This workshop successfully  
sensitized the group to the  
issues of prejudice and discrim-  
ination, and gave concrete methods  
for doing something about it.

You don't  
I said it.  

“The police captain said,  
matter of life and death,  
want a woman bodyguard.  
take the chance."  

The luncheon keynote speaker was  
Elizabeth Holtzman, elected as the  
first woman District Attorney in  
Queens in 1981. She was the youngest  
woman to ever serve in Congress (1973  
-1981) and while in the House success-  
fully sponsored and wrote legislation  
that authorized the deportation of  
former Nazis. She has been a strong  
supporter of ERA and laws concerning  
the privacy of rape victims. In 1980  
she lost by a 1% margin to incumbent  
Senator Alfonse D'Amato. Her topic  
was one she has spoken on many times:  
the empowerment of women.  

Ms. Holtzman began by referring  
to Corazon Aquino, noting that this  
was the first time in history that  
the shift from a military to a demo-  
cratic form of government was not only  
peaceful but led by a woman. She  
noted, “I think many had faith in her  
because she's a woman."  

Ms. Holtzman asserted that “as wo-  
men we can reach out and change the  
world." Corazon Aquino faced the  
same kind of resistance all women  
face, commenting that when she ran  
for DA the first time, a woman named  
Goldie Abramson read sexist radio ads  
that stated, ‘She's a nice girl, but  
not for DA.' Although that first  
race was quite close, sex was not an  
issue in the last one.  

"The question is more than getting  
power, but using it." Talented attor-  
neys in the DA's office had never got-  
ten promoted until Ms. Holtzman changed  
the unstated policy. Now close to 50%  
of the department heads are women, and  
for the past two years her office has  
had the highest New York City convic-  

PAGE 10 COMMON GROUND MAY 1986  

tion rate.  

Ms. Holtzman stated that many wo-  
men's issues are ignored in the larger  
scheme, such as violence against women.  
While in Congress she led the fight to  
change laws that treated rape victims  
like perpetrators, and through the  
courts she established the precedent  
of marital rape.  

Ms. Holtzman pointed out that na-  
tionally, a woman now sits on the Su-  

preme Court when 100 years ago a wo-  
man attorney could not argue in it.  
Women are candidates and astronauts,  
and in 1979 more women than men were  
in college. On a local level the  
number of elected women has tripled  
and anti-discrimination laws have  
raised the key issues of battered  
spouses, equal credit, pregnancy  
discrimination, childcare tax cre-  
dits, pension reform and parental  
leaves.  

Nonetheless, she noted, discrimi-  
nation exists despite major advances.  
It is difficult for a woman to raise  
money or get elected, and in New York  
State there are no women in Congress  
and no women running statewide in  
1986. In fact, New York ranks 34th  
in terms of the number of women in  
its Legislature.  

ERA is not adopted, tenure problems  
persist, and the Federal government  
gives money to colleges that discrimi-  
nate against women. In the labor force  
flextime, childcare and parental leaves  
are still not the norm, and women's pay  
has sunk to 63¢ on the dollar. A wo-  
man with a college degree earns $3000  
less than a male with a high school di-  
ploma. The Department of Justice has  
pulled back from women's rights issues  
and is trying to abandon affirmative  
action. And violence against women  
has increased: there is 1 rape every  
7 minutes, and a woman beaten every  
18 seconds.  

Ms. Holtzman insisted, “we must  
confront the problems. We need vi-  
gorous enforcement of anti-discrimi-  
nation laws...We need to expand our  
laws to include ERA and comparable  
worth...We must change the concept of  
the workplace to meet the needs of  
women who are mothers..."  

“Everyone is hurt by discrimination  
against women." Families need two in-  
comes to survive and unequal wages im-  
pact on an entire family, especially  

the 20% of all children who have a  
woman as their sole support. In ade-  
quate childcare restricts a woman's  
ability to work and our childcare  
standards lag behind the world. Fur-  
thermore, “a denial of equality equals  
a denial of the promise of America to  
over half its people.” Without ERA,  
women are denied individual worth,  
dignity and the desire to shape their  
own future.  

In conclusion, Ms. Holtzman in-  
sisted that women can create change  
through numbers. “In the last elec-  
tion, there were 8 million more wo-  
men than men voters," and signifi-  
cantly, more women than men voted.  
The goal is “not only justice for  
women, but a nation committed to  
peace and Israel. We have the power  
to shape this world and thus we have  
the responsibility. It's up to you."  

After her speech, Ms. Holtzman  
fielded several questions from the  
audience. She commented that “we  
ourselves diminish our issues" by  
not insisting on them. She labeled  
Jerry Falwell “America's version of  
the Ayatollah," pointing out both  
revile women, and the Family Pro-  
tection Act heavily supported by  
Falwell would deny Federal money  
to schools that teach about women  
in non-traditional roles. On Jack  
Kemp: “If we mobilize we can throw  
him out," and on a future run for  
a Senate Seat: “What I'd like and  
what's realistic are different."  

Ms. Holtzman left the podium to  
enthusiastic applause and more than  
a few comments of "we can do it!"  
from the audience.

One of the most delightful artists  
to be exhibited in "Directions '86"  
is Julie Kulberg Lewitzky, known lo-  
cally for her whimsical black and  
white drawings of Buffalo sites.  

Her distinctive style has been seen  
on cards, posters, the Parkside Com-  
munity Calendar and most recently on  
the cover of "Spree." She is best  
known for her drawings of local homes  
that seem to beam pleasing personali-  
ties.  

Ms. Lewitzky is from the Buffalo  
area and has “proudly lived in the  
City for 14 years." She began draw-  
ing professionally about 12 years  
ago when a realtor asked her to  
sketch some houses. "I really de-  
fine myself as an illustrator, not  
a commercial artist per se. People  
come to me with a space to fill."  
Word of mouth is her best advertising,  
with people referring their friends.  
“The more people who see my work, the  
better it is. People have even asked  
me to do all the houses they've ever  
lived in. One of my most interesting  
assignments was an illustration of  
the intensive care unit at Children's  
Hospital!"  

Although she has painted in oils,  
Ms. Lewitzky's real love is pen and  
ink. “I see myself as a literalist.  
I always work from photographs unless  
I'm drawing imaginary things. I in-  
terpret what I see, not copy it ex-  
actly. I take reality and transform  
it to an illustration, but reality  
is always the basis of the image.”  

"I've been drawing since I was a  
child. I remember drawing in grade  
school and not really paying atten-  
tion. I used to create imaginary  
orphanages filled with children, or  
huge families with 13 or 18 kids.  
Line always was my form of expression,  
and I'm comfortable with what I do -  
my illustrations usually come out  
right away."  

"I had wonderful fun doing the  
cover of 'Spree.' I took photos of  
the Clinton Market, but I made it  
a spring scene because I wanted  
flowers. I think I had the most  
fun, though, with a calendar of  
illustrations I did - I had it  
printed to give to my friends,  
like a vanity publication."  

Ms. Lewitzky said she is rare-  
ly without paper and sharpened  
pencils, whether it is next to the  
bed at night or on the dashboard  
of her car. “I truly enjoy draw-  
ing and lately I'm seeing rooftops  
and chimneys. I like living in  
Buffalo, and I suppose my ‘politi-  
cal interest' is how people are  
fixing up old homes everywhere in  
the city and turning Buffalo around,  
even in less desirable neighborhoods.  
I think it would be fun to illustrate  
a children's book or do a cover for  
the 'New Yorker,' something a bit  
more national. But I'm not very  
aggressive about it - I'm not in-  
terested in going to New York City."  

Ms. Lewitzky has been “married  
21 years to the same person," is the  
mother of “three mature teenagers"  
and owns two dogs that “appear in  
my pictures." Her gentle illustra-  
tions reflect both her love of her  
family and Buffalo, each house she  
draws a sentient haven sheltering  
the lives within.  

Julie Kulberg Lewitzky's cards  
may be purchased at the Book Review  
on Hertel Avenue, and her posters  
are available through the Albright-  
Knox and Museum of Science Gift  
Shops.

functioned as priests, spiritual lea-  
ders and synagogue presidents as well  
as contract signers and witnesses and  
merchants. In other words, the separa-  
tion of women was not always present  

in early Judaism.  

Through the medieval period, women  
acted as educators, bankers, scribes,  
shochets (ritual slaughterers) as well  
as religious leaders. In the 13th  
century, Mirabel of Gloucester was  
documented as a Jewish woman money-  
lender. Although contemporary tra-  
dition says women were and are for-  
bidden to be Torah scribes, a note  
written at the end of an early Torah  
states, "Do not condemn me for my errors  
for I am a nursing woman." An early  
18th century prayer book notes, "I  
am Gala, daughter of Moses the Printer-  
I am under 12 years old, and I set  
the type for this prayer book."  

Rebekka Tictner wrote the first  
Yiddish prayer book in 1609, and in  
the 17th century there were schools  
of Jewish women poets and a genre of  
essays and literature on women's  
rights. Jewish Sabbath School was  
invented by Rebecca Gratz in 1781,  
and the first American Jew to pub-  
lish in 1835 was a woman.  

Ms. Setel noted that whatever the  
documentation, there had always been  
a separate and distinct women's cul-  
ture. In one ancient custom, one  
month after a woman gives birth, she  
is joined by her female friends who  
dress her in her wedding gown, seat  
her on a throne-like chair, and cele-  
brate her. In Ashkenazi women's cul-  
ture, the tradition of the “caller  
out" created an entire group of women  
spiritual leaders who often explained  
text. The caller out informed the  
women behind the curtain where the  
men were in the service because the  
women used Yiddish texts - often  
written by women - instead of Hebrew  
books, and sat in a separate area.  

In effect, Ms. Setel observed, ritual  
restrictions on Jewish women were not  
the same as economic or social exclu-  
sion, and women often became the  
bridge for men between secular and  
religious culture.
