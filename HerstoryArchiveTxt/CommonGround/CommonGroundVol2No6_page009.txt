FRIDAY 8 p.m.  
Tonight at a Common Ground writers'  

meeting, I volunteered, with mixed  
feelings, to do this review. Reena  
and Other Stories is an inviting book.  
Its smell of paper-and-ink newness  
even beckons. Yes, I've been yearn-  
ing to read some fiction after a  
semester of reading students’ compo-  
sitions and term papers. And ever  
since I taught a Women's Studies  

course a few years back, I've felt  
the need to read more by and about  
women of color. However, there are  
only a few days in which to finish  
this task. Can I find the time?  
What if one of my children gets sick?  
Or what if I can't get them both to  
bed at the same time so as to salvage  
an hour or so of quiet time for me?  
But I'll undertake this most pleasant  
task, nonetheless.  

FRIDAY 11 p.m.  

Housework and the putting-to-bed  
routine is done. In my rocker, I  
meet Paule Marshall through her tell-  
ing introduction, "The Making of a  
Writer: From the poets in the kitchen."  
(I'm already drawn to read on, since  
most of my dealings these days occur  
in kitchens.) In this brief auto-  
biographical piece, she explains  
her influences. Her family, immi-  
grants from Barbados, lived in New  
York City. In late afternoons, her  
mother often had friends in, after  
most of them had spent the day clean-  
ing white women's houses. They  
would talk, animatedly, around the  
kitchen table. Their conversations,  
full of rich language and political  
and social comments during those  
turbulent 1930s, inspired the  
young, ever-attentive Paule to  
someday write. This interesting  

background pushes me to continue.  

FRIDAY, MIDNIGHT  

I'm quite tired, but I must read  
one story. “The Valley Between,” her  
earliest (1954) and first published  
story, begins with a one-page intro-  
duction which explains her reasons  
for writing the story. This tech-  
nique is one that I'd like to see  
writers use more often.  

This is an engaging story, which  
I fly through. Its main character,  
Cassie, a 24-year-old mother of  
one young child, is finishing her  
college education, much to the dismay  
of her husband. Not only is the theme  
one of great interest to any woman  
whose own needs or ambitions have  
interfered with the ease and pattern  
of their husbands' lives, but in  
only 9 pages, Marshall has made her  
characters come alive for me. I  
want to meet more of these characters  
but because my own children will be  
up in 7 or 8 hours, I must wait.

Finally, Andy is out for a walk,  
so while I'm nursing the baby, I can  
read "Brooklyn." Again, a brief  
introduction explains that its  
theme is sexual harassment. Begun  
in 1952, but not completed and pub-  
lished until 1962, and based on an  
actual experience of Marshall's,  
this story concerns an aging  
professor of French literature who  
is strongly attracted to a young  
student with "amber-colored skin."  
He attempts to persuade her to come  
to his country house on the pretense  
of discussing her master's thesis.  
How she reacts to this inappropriate  
advance and what she eventually does  
cannot be told here, for fear of  
spoiling, for other readers, the  
fine tension that Marshall weaves  
throughout this story.  

After reading it, however, I  
regretted knowing its theme ahead of  
time. I wish that I could have  
experienced the full impact of  
Marshall's tale without having first  
recalled my own associations and feel-  
ings about the offense of sexual  
harassment.  

MONDAY 11 p.m.  

Finally, time to myself again, which  
I've been so anxious for. "Barbados"  
(1961) is the story of a withered,  
solitary man, Mr. Watford, who has  
returned to his native Barbados after  
50 years of working in the U.S. Hav-  
ing acquired enough money to purchase  
a house "...pure, proud, a pristine  
white--disdaining the crude wooden  
houses in the village outside its  
high gate," he also acquires a servant  
girl.  

Although Marshall's character is  
nameless, she is vividly described:  

“The folk tale of creation  

might have been true with  
her; that along a river  

bank a god had scooped up the  
earth--rich and black and  

warmed by the sun--and  

molded her poised head with  

its tufted braids and then  
with a whimsical touch  
crowned it with a sober  
brown felt hat which should  
have been worn by some stout  

English matron in a London  

suburb, had sculpted the  

passionless face and drawn a  

screen of gossamer across  

her eyes to hide the void  

behind."  

There is relatively little action  
in the story but the character's  
movements, the silence and the phys-  
ical surroundings, which are described  
in a manner slightly reminiscent  
of the French novelist Alain Robbe-  
Grillet, underscore a tense dynamic  

between the girl and Mr. Watford, one  
which leads to his self-realization  
at the end. Again, Marshall has  
woven a tale that meshes suspense and  
description. And although this is  
the only story in the collection  

with a man as main character, our  
attention is still focused on her  
women characters, perhaps because,  
as the author tells us, they are  
the "bringers of truth."  

TUESDAY 11 p.m.  

I was so eager to read "Reena,"  
the story the anthology is named after,  
but I almost hesitate to write about  
it. Because it was published in  
Harper's Magazine in 1962, and in  
Toni Cade Bambara's anthology, The  
Black Woman, can I say anything fresh,  
anything novel about it?  

The strength of this piece lies  
in the variety of themes that it en-  
compasses in so few pages, all of  
which touch women's lives: family,  
education, work, love affairs, and  
raising children, to name a few.  

Yet all these themes are explored  

from a Black woman's perspective, and  
so they are blended with Black  

women's “...efforts to realize what-  
ever talents we had and to be our  

own persons in the face of the triple-  
headed hydra of racism, sexism and  
class bias we confronted each day;"  
as Marshall says in her introduction  
to "Reena."  

Reena is the character I was wait-  
ing to meet when I decided to review  
this book. And because of her, I am  
again compelled to reflect on the  
reality of [the experience of] women  
of color, a reality I'll never ex-  
perience first-hand, but that I, as  
a woman, still want to know about.  

WEDNESDAY 2 p.m.  

I have stolen an hour in the li-  
brary to read "To Da-Duh, In Mem-  
orium." In this most autobiographical  
of the stories, East meets West when  
nine-year-old New Yorker Marshall  
visits her “eighty-odd" year old  
Barbadian grandmother Da-Duh. Through  
such detailed descriptions as "...the  
women of Barbados wearing bright  
print dresses, the colors vivid  
against their darkness, the men rusty  
black suits that encase them like  
straight jackets," Paule Marshall paints  
a remarkably informative picture of  
both Barbados and New York City in  
the 1930s.  

WEDNESDAY, THURSDAY & FRIDAY late at  
night:  

As Marshall points out in her  
introduction to this novella, Merle  
"remains the most alive of my charac-  
ters...she's the most passionate  
and political of my heroines."  
"Merle" is a re-working, especially  
for this collection, based on the  
character of Merle Kinbona from  
Marshall's The Chosen Place,  
the Timeless People.  

The novella opens as Merle is  
prevented by a washed-out road from  
picking up Saul Amron, a field an-  
thropologist come to Bourne Island  
in the West Indies to work on local  
research and development programs,  
with his wife, Harriet, at the air-  
port. The subsequent relationship  
that develops between Merle, an  
incessant talker who talks about  
everything except her mysterious  
and painful past, and Saul, a white  
American, is both personal and  
political.  

It is personal because through
