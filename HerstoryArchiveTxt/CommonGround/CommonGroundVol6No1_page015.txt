WE CARE - AND  

Catholic... ex... ;  

she refuses to do so. She also  
feels that she can fight more  
effectively from the inside of an  
institution than from the outside.  
She wants to remain a Roman Cath-  
olic for all those who could not  
stay in.  

The price she and others have  
paid for her commitment has been  
high. Her parish priest was  
directed to excommunicate her,  
he did not choose to do so on his  
own, and she knows he agonizes  
over not being able to administer  
the sacraments to her. Since the  
church made her case public this  
past January, her daughter has  
had to endure nasty comments about  
her mother. (Luisa incidentally  
did join the church and Ms. Sorren-  

WHITE COLLAR RAGE  

by Janet Chassman  

Don't ask me to  

make your coffee because  
I'm the secretary  
Not the cook  

And don’t ask me to  

bring you coffee because  
I'm the secretary  
Not the waitress  

by Susan Clemens & Ritmeta Hecker  

And don't expect me to do more  
than one thing at a time because  

I'm a secretary  

Not an octopus  

And don't ask me to  
get you cigarettes because  
I'm the secretary  

Not the go-for. And don't ask me to fit  

20 letters into 15 spaces because  
I'm the secretary  

And speak clearly  

I'm the secretary  

And don't ask me to pull  

files that are not there because  
I'm the secretary  

Not the magician  

When reminded by a member of the  
audience that a governor of  

California, President Reagan had  
signed the most extensive abortion  

legislation in the country she  

And don't give me a task  

that you want done yesterday because  
I'm the secretary  

And when assigning a  
task, be specific because  
I'm the secretary  

Not the time traveler  
Not the mindreader  

Her recommended method of en-  
lightening the church as far as  
abortion rights and the plight of  
women in the church are concerned  
is a basic one: withhold all  
financial support. Since "money  
talks in this church," she urges  
that when the next Catholic Chari-  
ties Drive is conducted "just tell  
them you're giving your usual  
[Catholic Charities] contribution  
to Planned Parenthood!" She also  
does not believe one can support  
President Reagan and support pro-  
choice as well. When reminded by  
a member of the audience that as  
governor of California, President  
Reagan had signed the most exten-  
sive abortion legislation in the  
country, she replied, "Yeah, but  
that and 50 cents will get us nowhere.”  

Ms. Sorrentino concluded her  
address by saying she felt like  
the woman [Rosa Parks] who refused  
to sit in the back of the bus:  
there is no reason to comply with  
a rule which no longer has any  
validity, so why do it?  

And don't ask me to drop everything  

I'm working on when you holler because  
I'm your secretary  
not your mother!  

And don't ask me to send  
a Telex to a company  
“probably in Japan” because  
I'm the secretary  

Not the almanac

secretarial assignment for refusing to fetch coffee.
