On Finding One's Feminist Self In Atlanta

by Sarah Slavin

It was sleeting on October 12,  
1988, as Karen Peterson and I drove  
a half circle around Cleveland to  
turn South toward Atlanta, GA, and  
the Women in the Civil Rights  
Movement: Trailblazers and  
Torchbearers 1941-1965 conference  
convened by Mrs. Rosa Parks and  
Mrs. Coretta Scott King. The next  
morning, arriving through the  
Cumberland Mountains of Tennessee,  
fog webbed grey-blue evergreens and  
blood-red deciduous trees as I  
alternately reached for my camera  
and the redemptive ideas that years  
gone by sparked a torch in our  
hands.  

Before Freedom Summer, 25 years  
ago, I lived in Iowa City, IA, and  
was preparing to birth my third  
child and enter the university's  
law school. About 25 years before  
that, my father, a physician and  
University of Iowa graduate, had  
helped found the Southern Nevada  
Memorial Hospital in order that the  
Jewish and African-American people  
he had been first in our town to  
serve, might have the benefit as  
needed of hospitalization.  
Crossing color lines seemed to me a  
thing to do, although the  
reticences of a racist society then  
as now affected me no less than  
many others, including my father.  

Later in the morning, as Karen  
and I sat in a session, we read  
about the Chicago housing crisis,  
causing a Black family in suburban  
Chicago not to unpack (or repack)  
its belongings, but rather to pile  
them in boxes before the dining  
room windows, should local  
residents fire into the house. We  
read too from Dorothy Spruill  
Redford's Somerset Homecoming:  
Recovering a Lost Heritage,  
impressed by Mrs. Redford's  
brilliant decade-long search  
through census lists, inventories,  
will and property books and port  
records, through legacies as slim  
as "a single rotting sign” (p. 97);  
the search led on August 30, 1986,  
to a remarkable reunion of slave  
descendants at the Somerset Place  
State Historical Site in North  
Carolina. Said Barbara Eason  
Gateson on the occasion: "We are  
found."  

As a ‘white' woman, I have  
wondered how we white folks ever  
became so oppressive. October's  
trip to Atlanta was a matter of  
both redemption and responsibility.  
As the conference's litany of  
commemoration said: "We lift up  
the torch of hope, the beacon of  
truth, the light of knowledge, and  
proudly take our place."  

This was an important  
commemoration because the women who  
organized, underwrote, held up and  
together the civil rights movement  
have received sparse to no  
recognition in the subsequent  
passion plays and literature that  
have reflected and, indeed, are  
part of the movement's legacy.  

During a program on the 13th  
honoring Mrs. Rosa Parks, Dr.  
Margaret Walker placed her in the  
tradition of Sojourner Truth,  
Harriet Tubman, Mary McLeod  
Bethune, Mary Church Terrell, Sadie  
Tanner Alexander and Anne Arnold  
Hedgman: "And then there stood up  
a woman, rather, she sat down, to  
articulate the strength of her  
people, of true womanhood and of  
that deep longing for freedom..."  
In a strong old woman's voice  
cracked only by its ring, Dr.  
Walker reminded us of Ella Baker's  
statement that without women, there  
would have been no civil rights  
movement and gave us more names —  
Daisy Bates, Gloria Richardson,  
Fannie Lou Hamer, Ruby Doris Smith  
Robinson - of women who struggled  
against fascism, racism and sexism.  

And then, “Sister President" of  
Agnes Scott College, Dr.  
Johnetta Cole, reminded those  
present, an audience that included  
Melissa Burkholder, Mary Burks,  
Bertha Mae Carter, Christine King  
Ferris, Paul Hollenberg, Miles  
Horton and Mamie Till Mobley, that  
"looking at the roles of women in  
the civil rights movement is like  
looking into a mirror. We see  
ourselves." We see that, while the  
presence of women in historic  
struggle may be little noted, women  
have not often been absent from it.  
We see too that racism has gone on,  
with permission, despite the  
movement's successes and that women  
continue —  

now if Rosa Parks hadn't stood up  
to sit down?"  

President Cole kept on calling  
the roll - Marian Wright Edelman,  
Septima Clark - and entered onto it  
the names of Julia and Virginia  
Doerr, Anne Braden and Kathy Cade,  
white women. She quoted Braden,  
one of this writer's adult role  
models: "No woman reared in the  
South," and perhaps anywhere in the  
U.S., “can find freedom as a woman  
until she deals in her conscience  
with the question of race."  
Carrying the Torch: The  

Intersection of Race, Class and  
Gender was a major conference  
theme. We undertook its  

exploration on October 14,  
beginning at Ebenezer Baptist  
Church with the Viola Liuzzo  

Memorial Lecture and moved, as if  
inexorably, to a panel in Freedom  
Hall Auditorium at the Martin  
Luther King, Jr. Center for  
Nonviolent Social Change and to  
Mary Aiken Rothschild's paper on  
women volunteers in Freedom Summer.  
In fact, the part women played in  
the Student Non-Violent  
Coordinating Committee (SNCC)  
received considerable emphasis  
throughout the conference.  

Because of the conflict that  
developed in SNCC among Black and  
white women, and white women and  
Black men, I felt as if many of us  
at the conference must be holding  
our breaths in anticipation of a  

growing irritation that finally  
would crack with rebuke.  
Accordingly, I had ducked an  

afternoon session on the 13th,  
Resistance and  
Strategies of Empowerment in  
Mississippi, in favor of a swim in  
the hotel pool.  

But, here it was, in  
Rothschild's words "a non-uplifting  
part of an experience that was in  
other ways uplifting, that led to  
the development of feminism and  
spun off mistakenly into divided  
groupings." Rothschild, who is a  
white woman, called this “a sexual  
test" white women had to pass. To  
be blunt, would we participate in  
interracial sex with men? Women  
who did failed their exam. They  
also became objects of derision  
and, unlike their partners, might  
be sent home from the projects.  

At that time, even an allegation  
of sexual combination of a white  
woman and a Black man could be  
tragically explosive, as Emmett  
Till's mother, Mrs. Mobley, sitting  
in the front row of this session,  
probably not by accident and  
understandably, well knew. During  
Freedom Summer, we may often have  
ridden on car floors as much to  
avoid allegation by whites of  
interracial sexual combination as  
to hide pragmatically until the  
right moment the fact of Black and  
white together. Any reader of  
Eldridge Cleaver's later book, Soul  
on Ice, also must realize the  
symbolically and actually explosive  
qualities of this combination for  
some Black as well as white men.  

Viola Liuzzo came to know as  
intimately as anyone can the  
terrible costs of integration on  
her own assassination in 1974  
during conflict over admission of  
white members to Ebenezer Baptist  
Church. Viola Liuzzo came at her  
death to know the equally terrible  
cost for a white woman of traveling  
with Black men.  

Rothschild said that "everyone  
knew Black conditions were worse  
than any individual white woman's  
condition, so you were disloyal  
talking about it."  

After Freedom Summer, Casey  
Hayden (a discussant on this panel  
and presenter on one later in the  
day) and Mary King drew up a memo in  
which the position of women in SNCC  
was compared to the situation of  
Black people. The memo came forth  
anonymously; and an anonymous  
minute-taker at the famous  
crossroads meeting of SNCC  
activists recorded it carefully.  
Later, there came a second memo as  
well.  

The rebuke to the first memo  
came in the form of Stokely  
Carmichael's declaration that the  
position of women in SNCC is  
prone; and a rebuke came in  
Atlanta, too, although scarcely in  
so crude a thrust. A questioner, a  
Black woman, rose to ask how the  
modern feminist movement could have  
taken so many things from Black  
women's kitchens and created  
something so alien to Black women's  
experiences. A second Black woman  
objected to the use in Rothschild's  
presentation of the words "sexual  
advance" by a man; she had not  
found white women in SNCC to be
