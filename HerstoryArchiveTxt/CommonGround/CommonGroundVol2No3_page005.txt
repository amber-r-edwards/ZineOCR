LIFELINE, Holly Near and Ronnie  
Gilbert. Redwood Records.

{Editor’s note: In this review, local  
folk singer Kathy Moriarty responds to  
the Redwood Records production LIFE-  
LINE, a live album from the joint  
concerts of Holly Near and Ronnie  
Gilbert.]

Ms. Near has always  
had a righteous quality that  
sets her above and apart, and sets my  
teeth on edge. Ms. Gilbert has a  
down-home quality, telling the tale in  
a one-to-one manner. Her talent sets  
her apart, not her attitude.

For people like myself who have not  
enjoyed Near's work over the years,  
this is the time to reconsider. The  
live album LIFELINE combines Holly  
Near's and Ronnie Gilbert's finest  
efforts. Passion has met maturity,  
sharp clarity has met warm focus and  
the international has come home. With  
Gilbert's darker tone, Near has found  
the grounding her music has always  
called for.

Gilbert was Near's first major in-  
fluence. Ronnie had put in years  
with the famous “Weavers," performing  
songs of social commentary. When  
Ronnie first heard Near's live album,  
she knew it was only a matter of time  
before they found each other, sang  
together, and completed the circle.

One of the first songs they ever  
tried together was “Hav I Mujer  
Parecida.” A stirring duet rings  
out the names of eight women who are  
missing in Chile, having disappeared  
into the hands of the dictatorships.

Ronnie Gilbert and Holly Near both  
have a long fine heritage of enter-  
tainment and political and social  
protest. Both women are shown at  
their best here, and the album is one  
you will enjoy for a long time.

Can be ordered through EMMA  
Buffalo Women's Bookstore.

Blazon Books

is Newest of Women’s Presses

Blazon Books is one of the newest  
“women's books" small presses. It is  
based in Chicago and operated by Cama-  
rin Grae, a psychologist who also  
writes novels, and Joel Carothers, a  
typesetter with a bent toward entre-  
preneurship. Last year, with sever-  
al manuscripts of novels in hand, these  
two women took a look at the world of  
publishing and came out with a de-  
cision: "Let's do it ourselves."

Since then, they've been reading,  
writing, talking, networking, and  
typing. In October, 1983, their  
first book will roll off the pres-  
ses - THE WINGED DANCER, by Camarin  
Grae. It's a novel. It's a murder  
mystery. It's a psychological ex-  
ploration of the “male" and "female"  
sides of the personality of Kat Rogan,  
a lesbian, a strong, bright, educated  
woman, a fictional but very real  
person.

COMMON GROUND NOVEMBER 1983 PAGE FOUR

Grae and Carothers will have only  
2000 copies of the novel printed, so  
the price, $6.95, is higher than  
what Doubleday or Putnam can afford  
to charge. They have a friend, Angela.  
She does proofreading. She's helping.  
They have a friend, Shelley. She's  
an artist. She's helping. There's  
Dan. He's a dancer with linguistic  
skills. He's helping.

"I rely on the kindness of strang-  
ers," Camarin Grae said, "but only if  
we have a contract. Otherwise, I turn  
to those I know. So far I've been  
overwhelmed by people's eagerness to  
help. It's beginning to feel like a  
community effort."

Blazon Books’ first offering, THE  
WINGED DANCER, can be obtained di-  
rectly from the publishers (1934  
W. Belle Plaine, Chicago, IL 60613)  
and through some bookstores.

POET'S  
CORNER

Lest we forget...

The following poem is dedicated to  
the memory of the four American  
churchwomen who were murdered in  
El Salvador, December, 1980.

THE WILDINGS

In that strange land  
blue hydrangeas grow,  
wild and restless,  
leaping up the mountainside.  
Somewhere in a jungle labyrinth  
a hidden lagoon captures the sky.  
When we came down  
from the volcano  
darkness was swallowing  
the thin, wet road—  
where at some inopportune moment  
cattle might stray—  
and rain half-blurred our vision;  
yet we were singing  
until the city's lights  
put an end to our song.

Alice Todorovitch

FOOD FOR THE WOMB

as a slithering snake  
i swallowed whole  
the mouse of motherhood  
letting it digest slowly  
warming me into a false contentment  
i shed one skin to make room within  
then another, to hoard that carcass  
vomiting its remains, only to gobble  
the slime and narrow bones  
again. and again, long after  
it had ceased to fill me  
did i writhe and struggle  
in starvation  
with dark desperation  
i tasted toads  
and sampled sinewy lizards  
until finally i could be satisfied  
once more; the mouse still tempts me  
with its peculiar treat  
but now i eat when it pleases me  
and bask on the warm rocks  
in my own sleek silver skin

FOR EIGER

and the Woman said,  
"I am in need of light."  
so she stretched out her hand  
pulling one thread  
from the woven darkness,  
unraveling  
the mass made by men  
to let in  
the brilliance of truth;  
it warmed her  
and was good.
