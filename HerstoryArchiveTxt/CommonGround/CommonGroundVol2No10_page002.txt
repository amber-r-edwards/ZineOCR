COMMON GROUND

Conference  
Dimensions  

By Gerri Bayer and E.R. Mann  

WRITERS’ NOTE: This introductory  
essay is the result of a discussion  
between the two white women who  
covered the YWCA racism conference  
for CG. It, in some ways, explains  
some of the perspectives shown in  
the article. The definition of  
racism used in this essay was also  
the operative definition used at  
the conference.  

Racist is a word that hardly any-  
one willingly adopts as part of self-  
definition. Yet, it is a facet in  
the psyche of every white person in  
this country.  

Racism is defined by the U.S.  
government as having the power to  
enforce or institutionalize one's  
prejudices, and having white skin  
gives one that power, whether it is  
used or not.  

White-skinned people must be  
actively anti-racist, by admitting  
that they have the power to enforce  
their prejudices, investigating and  
owning those oppressive attitudes  
and acting on the elimination of  
those attitudes. Guilt is a useless  
emotion in that process, and getting  
caught in it prevents the real work  
of removing biases from happening.  

On the institutional level, an  
actively anti-racist person will  
investigate and remove those racist  
threads woven into the fabric of the  
structure. Unfair hiring practices,  
poor historical representation of  
people of color and anti-affirmative  
action conditions are just a few of  
those racist threads.  

Women must realize that both  
sexism and racism originate in the  
myth of superiority that surrounds  
white men, and that people of color  
and women of every race are oppressed  
by the power that white men are given  
just by virtue of being white men.  

On Thursday, May 10, at Buffalo  
State College, the YWCA presented  
a conference entitled "The Dimensions  
in Racial Justice".  

The conference covered many areas  
including education, politics, media  
and economics, and presented speakers  
of note; Dr. Mary Frances Berry,  
Commissioner, U.S. Commission on  
Civil Rights; Ramona Gallagher,  
Assistant Commissioner, N.Y.S. De-  
partment of Labor, plus many well-  
known local panelists on a variety  
of topics relevant to the topic of  
racial justice.  

During the day-long event, parti-  
cipants were encouraged to examine  
racism on a personal and institu-  
tional level; to see how it has in-

CONFERENCE REPORT  

The conference opened with a small  
press conference featuring Dr. Mary  
Frances Berry, Commissioner, U.S.  
Commission on Civil Rights, who was  
one of those fired by President  
Reagan. Reagan attempted to elimin-  
ate long-time civil rights activists  
like Dr. Berry from the commission,  
but she was reinstated to her posi-  
tion by the Supreme Court. Dr.  
Berry is a dynamic, articulate Black  
woman, a writer, academic and consti-  
tutional scholar, whose impeccable  
credentials and reputation put con-  
siderable force behind what she says.  

The press conference focused on  
the Civil Rights Commission and the  
function and future of this as Dr.  
Berry sees it. She feels the way the  
commission is being run now, as a  
“public relations office" for the  
White House, should not be allowed  
to continue. She pointed out that  
the commission, which has the power  
to enforce civil rights laws and  
rulings, has backed away from that  
role. For example, the commission  
has ruled out the use of community  
hearings, during which people could  
discuss with the commission problems,  
or perceptions of an issue, condi-  
tion or injustice. This is the  
primary tool traditionally used to  
investigate and evaluate charges of  
injustice or bias. The commission  
has changed its emphasis from seeking  
out and correcting injustice to  
making others prove that there is an  
injustice before it will act. She  
feels it is a reactionary attitude  
fueling this charge, and repeated  
a quote she overheard which illus-  
trated this attitude: "It's time  
we did something to help the poor  
white males."  

Dr. Berry emphasized that she  
doesn't think most Americans want  
to support actions that are against  
social justice. But we can be  
fooled by sugar-coated language which  
hides the real intent or impact of  
a law, piece of legislation, rule or  
statement by a public official.  

Civil rights, she believes, is not  
seen as a "hot issue", indeed, she  
said most polls show there are fewer  
overtly biased attitudes. Some  
Americans feel there is no longer  

a problem with racism and oppression.  
This public attitude denies the re-  
ality that these conditions have  
not fundamentally, but merely super-

ficially, changed. This has made  
the job of creating true social  
justice all the more difficult.  
When asked her opinion about the  
possibility that the commission  
would be defunded or disbanded, she  
said that there are those who want  
to defund it because it is not doing  
its job. Berry said she hopes that  
Congress will restrict its budget  
during appropriations in order to  
bring the commission back to its  
traditional role. “Otherwise," she  
said, “it's a waste of the taxpayer's  
money."  

We then went directly to the for-  
mal conference introduction. Edith  
B. Robinson, current president of  
the YWCA of Buffalo and Erie County,  
opened with the statement that "eli-  
minating racism wherever it exists  
and by any means necessary" is the  
Number One Imperative of the YWCA.  
She was followed by Jan Peters,  
Executive Director of the Buffalo  
Federation of Neighborhood Centers  
and President, Coalition of 100  
Black Women, Buffalo Chapter, who  
re-introduced Dr. Mary Frances Berry  
to the conference participants.  

The conference attendees were a  
mixed group: a few white men, a  
dozen or more white women, and  
most of the rest were Black men and  
women.  

What follows is a synopsis of  
Dr. Berry's presentation.  

"Race is a factor in allocation  
of benefits and burdens in this  
country," said Dr. Berry. She  
mentioned the voting rights issue  
as a major political issue of our  
time, and that many factors act  
against those who are interested in  
social justice. These factors in-  
clude budget cuts, poor leadership  
and policy which deny equal benefits  
to and participation of all people.  
One of her major points is that,  
while not overly racist, factors  
which consistently and adversely  
impact on or affect minorities still  
constitute oppression and institu-  
tional racism.  

She strongly stressed that Amer-  
icans need to realize that social  
justice, racial justice and an acti-  
vist civil rights movement are not  
only supported by the Bill of Rights  
and the Constitution, but that these  
documents specifically call for ac-  
tion to create equality. Her remarks  
were aimed at those who reject the  
implementation of affirmative action,  
who think that affirmative action  
has “gone too far", at those who  
have bought the myth that we have  
achieved equality and social justice,  
and more specifically at the Reagan  
administration which, in Berry's  
opinion, has made social justice seem  
frivolous or anti-American.  

She addressed the “pull yourself  
up by your bootstraps" myth, which  
maintains that “if you are qualified  
you will make it, so all you need  
to do is get qualified. If you don't  
make it you are inferior." Compe-  
tition is seen as healthy, making  
sure the most qualified get the
