119th Meeting  

YWCA CHOOSES COOPER  
TO CHAIR 119TH MEETING  

Linda A. Cooper, Assistant Vice  
President, Kidder, Peabody and  
Company, has been named Chair of  
the 119th annual meeting of the  
YWCA of Buffalo and Erie County,  
“Celebrate a New Beginning" to be  
held at 5:30 PM, Thursday, March 9,  
1989, at the Downtown YWCA, 190  
Franklin Street, Buffalo. Ms.  
Cooper is serving her second three  
year term on the YWCA Board of  
Directors, and is a past Treasurer  
of the Association. She is a  
resident of Lakeview.  

The annual members' meeting will  
review accomplishments of the past  
year, including the expansion of  
the YWCA shelter for homeless women  
to families, opening after school  
child care sites in the Buffalo  
Public Schools, offering the first  
physical training program for  
female firefighter candidates and  
extending transitional services at  
the YWCA Residence to men.  

The YWCA of Buffalo and Erie  
County was founded in 1870, the  
eleventh in the nation. Its  
purpose is to respond to the unmet  
needs of the community, especially  
those of women and girls, and to  
strive for peace, justice, freedom  
and dignity for all people, and the  
elimination of racism. The local  
YWCA is a part of the YWCA of the  
USA, and is affiliated with the  
World YWCA, with associations in 83  
nations. It was one of the  
founding agencies of the United Way  
of Buffalo and Erie County, and  
serves over 2,500 YWCA members and  
their families.  

The YWCA annual meeting is open  
to the public. For information,  
call the Downtown YWCA at 852-6120.  

Tax Credits for Child Care  

Parents who pay someone to care  
for a child or dependent while they  
work or look for work may qualify  
for a special tax credit, according  
to Donald Mitgang, district  
director for the Buffalo district  
Internal Revenue Service.  

This Child and Dependent Care  
Credit may be taken not only for  
payments to babysitters and daycare  
centers but also to certain  
relatives paid for this service.  

This credit is available to  
married couples who both work  
part-time or full-time or are  
actively looking for work, and file  
jointly. If one spouse works  
full-time and the other works  
part-time, is a full-time student,  
or is disabled, he or she is also  
eligible for the credit, Mitgang  
said.  

The credit may also apply to a  
divorced or separated parent who  
has custody of a child who is under  
15 or physically or mentally  
incapable of self-care, even though  
the parent may not be entitled to a  
dependency exemption for the child.  
The parent claiming the credit  
must, however, have custody for a  
longer period during the year than  
the other parent. A married person  
living apart from his or her spouse  
for the last six months of the  
taxable year, is eligible for the  
credit if a separate return is  
filed.  

To qualify for the Child and  
Dependent Care Credit, a taxpayer  
must have been gainfully employed  
or in active search of gainful  
employment when the expense for the  
child's or dependent's care was  
incurred, and must have paid over  
half the cost of maintaining his or  
her household, which included one  
or more qualifying individuals.  

Additional information is  
available in IRS Publication 503,  
"Child and Dependent Care Credit,  
and Employment Taxes for Household  
Employers," which may be ordered by

Breast Cancer Risk  

Researchers at the Boston University  
School of Medicine have found  
that women under 45 years old who  
use oral contraceptives (the Pill)  
have two times the risk for breast  
cancer than do women who have never  
used the Pill. Those women who  
have used the Pill for 10 or more  
years are four times more likely to  
develop breast cancer. This  
information presented at a F.D.A.  
hearing contradicts previous studies  
which discounted any association  
between oral contraceptives and  
breast cancer, indicating at least  
the need for further study. It  
is already established that women  
over 35 who take the Pill and who  
smoke are at greater risk for  
heart attack and stroke.

Setback in  
Sharon Kowalski Case  

At presstime there is word of  
another delay in allowing Sharon  
Kowalski, disabled since a 1983  
car accident, access to rehabilitation  
services, and to her lover,  
Karen Thompson, who has led the  
fight.  

In 1983, Kowalski was awarded to her father's  
guardianship. Since then, Kowalski  
has languished in a nursing home,  
unable to receive therapies and  
services.  

Thompson brought a suit against  
the guardianship, successfully  
arguing that Kowalski was competent  
to express her wishes.  

Kowalski moved to a center special-  
izing in rehabilitation services.  
However, on January 3, the judge  
then granted Kowalski's father a two  
week delay to prepare an appeal to  
the judge's order.  

Kowalski's supporters are angry  
that the judge would allow the  
appeal, but also point out that  
her father has "just about run  
out of excuses" for preventing his  
daughter from getting better therapies.  
In addition, they noted that  
the appeals process allows the  
reports which confirm Kowalski's  
competence to become public,  
which will only strengthen her  
case and further illustrate that  
her father could not possibly have  
her best interests in mind.

-dealing with AIDS  

Roe vs. Wade Assault  

Roe v. Wade, the landmark 1973  
Supreme Court decision protecting  
a woman's right to privacy in her  
decision to terminate a pregnancy  
during the first trimester, will be  
challenged again on constitutional  
grounds this year. Roe v. Wade had  
been unsuccessfully challenged in  
1983 and 1986 when the Supreme  
Court was still thought to be  
somewhat "pro-choice".  

Pro-choice advocates see this  
latest challenge as more serious  
because the complexion of the  
Court has changed considerably  
with Ronald Reagan's appointments  
of Justices Scalia and Kennedy,  
and because it is a good test in  
law from the anti-choice forces'  
point of view.  

The Supreme Court agreed Jan. 9  
to review the Missouri appellate  
court's ruling that a Missouri  
law does "...not simply decline  
to fund abortions when it forbids  
its doctors to encourage or counsel  
women to have abortions. Instead,  
it is erecting an obstacle in the  
path of women seeking full and  
uncensored medical advice about  
alternatives to childbirth." If  
this case is overturned, it leaves  
open the possibility for other  
states to pass anti-choice legislation  
without fear of the restrictions  
of Roe v. Wade.  

Groups to health care training,  
workshops and a caring staff offer  
education, information, support and  
love to many.  

The physical, mental and  
emotional suffering from AIDS is  
tremendous, but the love I have  
seen is also tremendous. In the  
introduction to her book, AIDS:  

" . . . BE  
The Uheima ite ae Kubl  
that deny is a life  
threatening illness that will  
eventually involve millions of  
people, decimate large  
populations.  

We can grow and learn from it, to either  
help the people with this dread  
disease or abandon them. It will  
be our choice to live up to this  
ultimate challenge or to perish."  

As we reflect upon this holiday  
season and look forward to the new  
year, I ask you to think about  
giving generously to the Western  
New York AIDS Program. We are  
taught that what we do for our  
brothers will come back to us  
tenfold. I sincerely believe that  
AIDS is here to remind us how to  
love one another. Please do and  
give what you can from your heart  
and you are sure to bring peace to  
yourself and your family.  

May the joy of giving be yours.  
Thank you.  

Sincerely,  
Marie Chapman  

P.S. The services of the Western  
New York AIDS Program are  
needed now more than ever. As  
the number of reported AIDS  
cases rises, this agency is  
called upon more and more.  
With your contribution, WNYAP  
will be able to continue to be  
of service to the Western New  
York community. And remember,  
your contribution is tax  
deductible.  

Please make your gift payable  
to WNYAP and mail this card to:  
220 Delaware Ave. Suite 512  
Buffalo, NY 14202  

You!
