Mollyolga Neighborhood Art Classes

There is a woman by the name of  
Molly Bethel. Twenty-five years  
ago, Molly was working as an art  
teacher. The children of her East  
Side neighborhood found out that  
she was an art teacher and demanded  
that she teach them also. Now most  
of us know that kids don't just ask  
anyone to do something like teach  
them art. Molly must have had a  
special touch. First she took them  
into her kitchen where she held  
"Painting Parties." The number of  
children grew, so they packed up  
their easels and moved over to a  
local church hall. Soon there were  

MOLLY BETHEL  

too many for Molly to manage alone  
so she called on the teachers col-  
lege in search of volunteers. Enter  
Olga Lownie, an art education maj-  
or. Olga arrived with the inten-  
tion of fulfilling her pre-student  
teaching requirement, and well, as  
Molly says, she just stayed. That  
she did. She stayed and combined  
her energies with Molly's and with  
the help of countless others, the  
Mollyolga Institute came into being.  

They spent the next eleven years  
in the church hall. Eventually  
they moved into a beautiful, old  
brick building in the heart of the  
Fruit Belt which just happened to  
be a convent complete with nuns.  
More years went by, the nuns moved  
on, they bought the building,  
students, programs and staff in-  
creased and the dream flourished.  
This June Mollyolga will celebrate  
its twenty-fifth anniversary and  
host a reunion open to all former  
students. All of this will coin-  
cide with the annual year-end art  
show which begins at 2:00 on Sunday  
June 2. Everyone is encouraged to  
come, but if you do, don’t expect  
to see any special awards. Rather  
than competing against each other  
for recognition, each student  
enters her/his finest work of the  
year as its own reward. Do expect  
to be pleasantly surprised.  

The following interview feels  
somewhat incomplete to me partly  
because I know Molly has much to  
say on subjects I didn't even touch  
upon, and partly because Olga was  
not available to participate. She  
did have a valid excuse, however.  
She was on board a plane to New York  
City where the next day both she  
and Molly (along with Willem de  
Kooning, Lena Horne, Isaac Bashevis  
Singer and others) were to receive  
the 1985 New York State Governor's  
Arts Award.

Alas: Tell me something about the  
philosophy behind Mollyolga.  

Molly: We are trying to create an  
atmosphere of art here which is  
realistically accessible to any-  
one who has an interest in devel-  
oping their talent. Realistic is  
an important word there. You can  
say something is accessible, but  

if you can't get to it or if it  
costs thirty-five dollars to go to  
the class for six weeks when you do  
get to it, then that is not real-  
istically accessible. We feel that  
the atmosphere of the building is  
very important. When you walk in,  

OLGA LOWNIE  

nothing is happening here but art,  
and it's all very serious art. We  
may have a lot of fun here, but  

the art is not taken lightly. There  
is an atmosphere of hard work while  
allowing for the needs of each in-  
dividual person.  

Alas: Is there a spiritual basis  
for your work?  

Molly: Yes, I believe everybody has  
some kind of special talent whether  
it be sewing or taking care of  
others or whatever. I think each  
person has a responsibility to use  
whatever talent God gave them. Be-  
sides being able to create my own  
art, I seem to be pretty good at  
passing on what I understand to  
other people. Therefore I have a  
responsibility to do that.  

I also think that there is so  
darn much talent floating around  
that is wasted. It is not right to  
waste talent. There are so many  
kids that do not have a place they  
can realistically go, and the talent  
may be wasted.  

Alas: One of the areas which you  
have developed over the past six  
years is the teen/adult program.  
Is there a difference for you be-  
tween teaching children and adults?  
Molly: Mainly it's a difference in  
timing and vocabulary. It is the  
way you express things, although  
they are the same concepts. We  
start right out teaching the pre-  
schoolers composition even before  
they learn to draw, but we just  
word it a different way.  

Alas: I understand that you have  
been instrumental in helping your  
students go on to other schools.  
Molly: Oh yes, we've done quite a  
lot of work with people in prepar-  
ing portfolios for either high  
school entrance in special programs  
or college entrance, and one thing  
we are really proud of is that  
everyone who has done their port-  

folios here has been admitted wher-  
ever they applied. And some people  
have received scholarships.  

Alas: Where is Mollyolga going?  
Molly: Right now we just sort of  
have to settle back and let it all  
sink in. We are at a point where  
we are able to be very flexible and  
very responsive to people's needs  
whether it be to start out and  
learn basics or to get off by your-  
self and get into yourself. We have  
almost everything in place that we  
want to have in place in terms of  
programs, and the building is sort  
of under control. I just want to  

settle in and work with the stu-  
dents. And work on my own paint-  
ing.  

Alas: What about your own art? Do  
you have time for it?  

Molly: Yes, I make sure I have time  
for it. I have not been exhibiting  
through the period when my children  
were growing up because something  
had to go, and exhibiting was the  
least important to me. I wanted to  
keep the school going and to keep  
painting. Exhibiting could wait.  
Alas: Are you mostly a painter?  
Molly: I am basically a painter.  

I do a lot of work in pastels simp-  
ly because when my kids were bab-  
ies, I was worried about them get-  
ting into oil paints and they took  
time to clean up. Pastel I could  
just put down and walk away from,  
so it was very practical and it  
turned out that I liked it. Pastel  
was a way to circumvent what was a  
mechanical process rather than a  
creative one.  

Alas: What was it like trying to  

do all this with a family to care  
for?  

Molly: I'm of a generation before  
all this women's movement started,  
and when I was your age it was not  
easy to be number one a serious  
woman artist, which I am, and number  
two to raise a family and have your  
family be important to you while  

at the same time run a school.  

That was not commonly done at that  
time. Now women seem to assume  
they can do this sort of thing, but  
I am very aware of the tradeoffs  
and the balances you really have to  
make. When my kids were little I  
used to teach with them on my hip.  
Alas: Where did you find the cour-  
age to do it?  

Molly: I just always did it! (Laugh-  
ter.) I was out of synchronization  
with my time.  

Alas: Did your husband support you?
