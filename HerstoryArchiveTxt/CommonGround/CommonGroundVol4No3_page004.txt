there is a "force unravelling the  
gains women have achieved over the  
last 30-40 years." She criticized  
the actions of the Reagan admini-  
stration in their successful dilu-  
tion of Title Nine (which originally  
prevented funds from going to  
schools that discriminated on the  
basis of sex.) As a result, 90% of  
prior protection against discrimina-  
tory practices in schools has been  
eliminated, said Smeal. She also  
reported that there is an Executive  
Order eliminating affirmative action  
in awarding government contracts.  
The Civil Rights Restoration Act,  

a bill to restore full protection  
against discriminatory practices in  
schools receiving federal funds, is  
now in Congress, trapped by an anti-  
abortion amendment.  

On the issue of gay rights, Ms.  
Smeal accused conservatives of big-  
otry and undermining legislation  
that does away with discrimination.  
She referred to feminists as "secu-  
lar humanists" in their fight against  
discrimination and in their demand  
for equal rights. Ms. Smeal be-  
lieves that there is a pro-nation-  
alism/a super patriotism that makes  
those who question somehow  
unpatriotic. She claims Reagan  
and other conservatives are con-  
vincing people this is so, and em-  
phasized that "America is a plural-  
ism and we must fight for it."  

In response to a question re-  
garding the military draft, Smeal  
emphasized that the military is a  
system of keeping women inferior.  
She said by keeping women "safe"  
and by “protecting" them, men  
keep women dependent and inferior.  
She said women didn't need to be  
protected, "We are smart," she  
said. "Do you think there would be  
as many rapes if they thought we  
were trained as Marines?"  

Ms. Smeal was critical of Jack  
Kemp and does not consider him to  
be a leading presidential candi-  
date because of his non-support  
of women's rights.  

N.O.W. CONVENTION  
FROM PAGE ONE  

a week during the changeover  

in the National NOW administration  
and had some small opportunities  
to push Buffalo as the conven-  
tion site. But the real effort  
came during this year's National  
convention in Washington, D.C.  

"we did a read sales job,"  
said Castro. “We put signs on  
the hotel room doors of the na-  
tional board members that read  
"ssshhh, I'm dreaming of Buffalo",  
distributed Buffalo Chips (maca-  
roons with chocolate coating)  
which we ‘called in' at our  
presentation when we asked for  
the women to vote for Buffalo  
as the convention site. We  
dressed as suffragettes, in long  
white skirts with purple sashes  
that had "Vote Buffalo" printed  
on them.”  

“The sales job worked. By  
3:30 Sunday afternoon, we knew  
we had won the vote and that the  
convention would be here.“  

Nancy Castro, Ruth Laws, Kathy  
Jackson, Barbara Gannis, Doris  
Kent of Buffalo NOW and Colleen  
Gaughan from the Convention Center  
arrived back in Buffalo late that  
night to be greeted by the local  
media.  

"The hard work is just be-  
ginning," Castro said. There is  
a monumental organizational  
task to be done, arranging for  
alternate housing, support ser-  
vices, security; a marketplace  
where women can sell goods and  
advertise services, and several  
other small but crucial details."  

“The Buffalo Women's community  
can and has offered to help and  
every offer of support is appre-  
ciated. We need interpreters  
for the deaf, runners, organizers  
anyone who is willing."  

Anyone who is willing to  
volunteer can call the NOW line

Buffalo NOW Candidate's Night  

The annual candidate's night  
sponsored by the Buffalo Chapter  
of the National Organization  
for Women drew a larger than  
usual crew of those running for  
elected office this year.  

The most controversial aspect  
of the evening was the address  
by Mayor Griffin. He took his  
two minutes, which was the time  
allotted to each candidate, to  
congratulate NOW on having their  
convention in Buffalo in 1988  
and to list the names of women  
in his own City Hall cabinet.  

As time ran out, the mayor con-  
tinued to talk, though the  
evening's moderator tried several  
times to indicate to him that  

his time was up, and it was  

now time for questions from the  
audience. He finally halted when  
the moderator turned to those  
assembled and said, "Well, you  
see how much respect he has  

for our organization."  

The first question dealt with  
the NOW 1986 Convention issue.  
Why, a NOW member asked, did  
Griffin have time to welcome  
Sophia Loren to the city in per-  
son, but not have time to meet  
with top officials of the Nation-  
al Organization for Women who  
were considering bringing a  
convention worth three million  
dollars to Buffalo?  

"But who did I send?" Griffin  
asked. “I sent Sara Naples,  
the first woman corporation coun-  
sel in the history of the State  
of New York. Don't you think  
she was a great representative?"  

It was indicated to Mayor  
Griffin that this was not sa-  
tisfactory as far as Buffalo NOW  
was concerned.  

George Arthur was out of town,  
but sent a representative who  
indicated that Arthur was in  
support of NOW's four major  
issues: reproductive rights,  
the ERA, an end to racial dis-  

crimination and pro-lesbian and  
gay rights.  

Nicholas C. Costantino,  
running on the Liberal Party  
line, criticized Griffin for  
what he claimed was the mayor's  
failure to take preventive  
action against rape in the  
city streets, and for not pro-  
viding better police protection  
in combating the anti-abortion  
picketing since May at local  
medical clinics on Elmwood and  
High Street. Constantino also  
came out in favor of all four  
of Buffalo NOW's main platform  
points.  

MILITARY SEX DISCRIMINATION  

Sen. William S. Cohen said  
he is concerned that the mili-  
tary still has many restrictions  
for women participants. Entry  
in every service branch, oppor-  
tunities for promotion, access  
to education and training are  
all, in some way, denied to women  
strictly because of gender,  
he charged.  

Army, Navy and Marine Corps  
recruitment policies for women  
are much stricter than those  
for men, he noted. The Marine  

Corps requires all women enlistees  

to hold a high school diploma  
while men are only required to  
attend school through the 12th  
grade. Women are allowed to  
serve on all ships in the Coast  
Guard and in all jobs, but  
women in the Navy are restricted  
in their permanent assignments  
to approximately 74 ships, out  
of a fleet of 600.  

Women comprise 9.5% of the  
active duty force, and the De-  
partment of Defense has projected  
only a small increase by  
the end of 1987. The majority  
of service women are clustered  
in the middle to lower grade  
officer grades. Currently there  
are three women at the flag/gen-  
eral officer level in the Army,  
three in the Air Force, three  
in the Navy and none in the  
Marine Corps.

SALUTE TO SUCCESS  
by Carolyn Iadovito  

On Sunday, September 29, 1985  
the Buffalo Branch, American  
Association of University Women,  
held its annual open house "A  
Champagne and Chocolate Celebra-  
tion” at the residence of Buffa-  
lo State College President and  
Mrs. D. Bruce Johnson. This  
annual event provides an oppor-  
tunity for prospective members  
to become acquainted with the  
goals and philosophy of AAUW,  
to meet the board of directors  
and members, and become familiar  
with the interest and study groups.  

Continuing its effort to  
recognize professional women in  
Western New York, Buffalo Branch  
honored a select group of women  
who are leaders in their pro-  
fessions. Those honored were:  
-Honorable Judge Dolores Denmen,  
Associate Justice Appellate  
Division  
-Honorable Joan K. Bozer, Erie  
County Legislature  
-Ms. Carol Jasen, Anchorwoman  
WIVB-Channel 4  
-Dr. Olga Mendell, Associate  
Professor of Spanish, D'Youville  
College; Governor's Advisory Com-  
mittee for Hispanic Affairs  
-Ms. Joan K. Holzman, President  
Buffalo Publishing Company  
-Ms. Gayle Johnstone, Director  
of Planning, City of Buffalo  
-Ms. Janice H. DiNezza, Group  
Media Supervisor, Healy-Shutter  
& Comstock. Recently named one  
of the 100 most successful young  
women in the U.S.  

-Ms. Florence Baugh, President  
Buffalo Board of Education  

-Ms. Joan Danzig, Editor of Home  
Living, Buffalo News  

Chairwoman of this event was  
Shirley M. Yavno and membership  
chairwoman is Sylvia P. Volk.  

Membership in AAUW is open  
to all women with baccalaureate  
degrees. For information on  
membership call 884-2812. For

NO-FAULT DRAWBACKS  

No-fault divorce laws have  
not brought about the economic  
equity they were designed for,  
according to Lenore Weitzman,  
author of a new book entitled  
The Divorce Revolution.  

Her research shows that in  
the first year after divorce  
the standard of living for women  
and minor children falls 73%  
while for men it rises 42%.  

This is due in part to the fact  
that in dividing property, courts  
do not generally take into  
account career assets, pensions,  
and retirement funds and medical  
insurance. The average alimony  
award lasts 25 months and the  
average child support award is  
$200 a month for two children.

WOMEN’S  
STUDIES  
HERSTORY  

by April Hamlin  

Have you ever taken a Women's Studies  
course? By now the question being asked  
is; just what is Women's Studies? In  
answer to that, Women's Studies is a new  
dimension to education, for not only does  
it give women a basic knowledge about  
themselves, and other women, never pre-  
viously taught; it teaches us as women  
to critically evaluate the knowledge  
gained in other areas of the educational  
system.  

Women's Studies began in the late 1960s  
and was then known by several names, such  
as, female studies, feminist studies and  
the phrase that eventually stuck, Women's  
Studies. The idea for a female centered  
curriculum grew out of the Women's Lib-  
eration movement, which was at that time  
expanding to other areas in women's lives  
such as politics, and social aspects. So  
movement into the academic sphere seemed  
a natural course of expansion.  

With its modest beginnings Women's  
Studies grew from 2 programs and 100  
courses in early 1970, to more than 112  
programs and over 4,500 courses nation-  
wide, by 1974. There were other events  
occurring at that time which helped  
Women's Studies grow so quickly. Cur-  
riculum reforms were being made in many  
colleges in the hopes of keeping enroll-  
ment up, which was then declining. Coll-  
eges had hoped that inclusion of Minority  
Studies would make them appear more rele-  
vant to minority students. Although women  
could not be called a minority, for they  
made up 42% of the undergraduate univer-  
sity population, women had not gained  
recognition in the Curriculum previously  
offered.  

Even though the Women's Studies move-  
ment was nationwide, its birth in our  
area was not easy. There were many  
tactics used against its beginning at our  
local colleges, from the statement that  
certain courses (Women's Studies) were  
not academically sound enough to be  
included in the college experience, to  
budget cuts that were used to "weed out”  
unnecessary expenditures, which had the  
effect of sometimes “weeding out" certain  
Women's Studies courses.  

By this point, perhaps you may be  
thinking of taking a Women’s Studies course  
yourself. Now for the disturbing news.  
Out of 14 local colleges and universities  

surveyed, only 6 had any type of Women’s  
Studies programs. One college simply had  
too few courses offered, with no specific  
degree granting program. Four of the  
six colleges offered a program which  
granted a minor, and only one offered a  
B.A. degree. For all the progress made  
to include Women's Studies in the college  
program, the outcome locally seems slight-  
ly disappointing. Not that we as women  
shouldn't be proud of the program avail-  
able to us, for it has been a hard fought  
battle to keep Women's Studies an active  
participant in college education, and the  
struggle is not yet over. As long as  
Women's Studies exists, it must be assured  
that the program will expand; for it  
could easily disappear if a constant  
vigil is not kept. This concern about  
Women's Studies strength is being addressed  
at the present time. On October 15, the  
State University College at Buffalo, spon-  
sored the first meeting to organize the  
local college's Women's Studies programs.  
The hope was to create a network for pro-  
gress in Western New York. The theme of  
the gathering was, "Collaborations and  
Connections", which hopefully also des-  
cribes the underlying theme of the group.  
This could be an important first step in  
gaining community wide support for Women's  
Studies.  

The women who attended the meeting,  
some with Women's Studies from its concep-  
tion, have an impressive number of valu-  
able experiences. With the type of lead-  
ership available in the local area, the  
program has great potential for growth.  
The leadership is there, but without con-  
tinued interest from the community, this  
growth may not happen.  

Now, if you had never thought of taking  
a Women's Studies course, but now are con-  
sidering doing so, the local Colleges and  
Universities that offer Women's Studies are  
listed here for more information please  
feel free to contact them.
