Coalition for Abortion Rights and  
Against Sterilization Abuse  

GET INVOLVED  
TO PROTECT  
YOUR RIGHTS  

WHO WE ARE  

CARASA is a group of feminist activists  
who advocate women’s right to safe & legal  
abortion & who work towards ending the  
abuse of sterilization in this country &  
worldwide.  

CARASA has been actively working to  
counter the small but well-organized anti-  
choice movement & its right wing backers.  
However, CARASA is more than a pro-choice  
group. We view the right of women to safe &  
legal abortion as part of a broader & more  
fundamental spectrum of reproductive  
freedom.

filiate; Individual Affiliate; or Sustainer.

*From Page 8  

But Natasha "(doesn't) think any-  
thing could be solved by a separate  
women's movement," even though she  
said "changes certainly ought to take  
place in the home." She's not used  
to an idea we [in this culture] take  
for granted: that citizens can band  
together and act for change. "Here,  
decisions are made through political  
organizations, elected representatives  
in the workplace... Right now, the  
attitude of most men is ‘Woman, you  
take care of the household! Hand me  
the newspaper!‘ How could this pos-  
sibly be changed by a few decrees?"  

That the women's movement [in  
this country] does not consist of  
"decrees" or statements handed down  
from the "party" or some organization,  
rather than a grassroots effort  
for social change is out of her ken.  
She does speculate that “perhaps  
individual women can gradually  
change the masculine attitude. Not  
by screaming and crying and being  
hysterical... ” So much for the pic-  
ture of our women's movement purveyed  
in the Soviet newspapers. She con-  
tinued: "...but by logical proof that  
this is true and that is true and  
there it is in black and white [will  
change occur].  

I wish I could tell Natasha that  
“proof in black and white" has not  
been enough, so far, to induce Amer-  
ican men to relinquish their power--  
(Women make 59 cents for every male-  
earned dollar, Mr. Reagan!) --not  
only over women, but also over people  
of color, the elderly, the poor...  

As I read Moscow Women, I kept  
wishing I could meet these women,  
argue and listen, react to their  
words, and hear their reactions to  
mine. Despite substantial differ-  
ences--especially in the attitude  
toward authority--we have a lot  
in common.
