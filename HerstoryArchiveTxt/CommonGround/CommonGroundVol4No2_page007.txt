Jara, Joan. AN UNFINISHED SONG:
THE LIFE OF VICTOR JARA. Ticknor
& Fields, 1984. ISBN 0-89919-279-3

reviewed by Judith Geer

Chilean singer/songwriter Victor
Jara was one of the overwhelming
number of people (including Amer-
ican Charles Horman, subject of
the film MISSING) who were murdered
by right-wing groups during the
Pinochet coup in Chile in September
1973. I first heard Jara's name on
a Pete Seeger album. Seeger read
the last poem Jara had written in
the stadium in Santiago while
awaiting his execution. The poem
had been smuggled out by a friend
of Jara's who had been with him
before he died. Although unfinish-—
ed, the poem was a moving epitaph
and when several months later I
found a biography of Jara written
by his widow, Joan, I was anxious
to learn more about this remarkable
man.

Victor Jara was born into pover-
ty and orphaned as a teenager.

He had tried the military and the
priesthood before training as a
theatre director. His musical
gift had not yet been tapped when
he and English dancer Joan Roberts
were married in the early '60s.
Joan had moved to Chile in the
'50s with her first husband, a
Chilean dancer. She had been re-
pulsed by the rule of the oligarchy
in Chile—a few wealthy families
seemed to own and run everything—
and even though she had been in—

her dancing and teaching careers,
she became aware of the early rum-
blings of imminent rebellion.

In 1960, when Joan was awaiting
the birth of her first child, Man-

uela, her husband abruptly left her.

Feeling totally alone, Joan suffer-
ed a nervous breakdown. Toward

the end of 1960, after recovering
from her illness, she began her
relationship with Victor, a former
dance student of hers, and they
soon married.

Throughout the ‘60s, Victor
became better known as a songwriter
and singer than as a theatre direc-
tor. His lyrics expressed the ag-
ony of the Chilean poor and the
hope for a better life offered by
the Communist (Popular Unity) party
led by Salvador Allende. According
to Joan, the folk song movement—

which was a significant political
tool in the U.S. at the same time—
played a prominent role in the
eventual election of Allende to
the Presidency of Chile in Septem-
ber 1970. Joan carefully outlines
the steps taken which brought about
the Allende victory in spite of an
influx of CIA money and personnel
to engineer his defeat.

After the election the CIA in-
fluence became even stronger. Al-
though Allende's Popular Unity
party was able to initiate much
needed reforms for the massive
number of Chilean poor, the right-
wing parties published scandalous
lies about the Communists. Since
there were no libel laws in Chile
and Allende was reluctant to curb
freedom of speech, these lies were
practically impossible to combat.

PAGE 6 sc ora GROUND bay ic ad 1985,

The nationalization of the American-
owned copper mines was answered

by strikes called by the wealthy
owners of the trucking industry

and this combined with the hoarding
of consumer goods created false
shortages of food and gasoline.

In spite of all this, Popular Unity
scored a large congressional vic-
tory in March 1973. This signaled
the beginning of the end for the
Communists and on September 11,
1973, the Chilean military under
General Pinochet staged a violent

coup. Allende died during the
coup (some say he was murdered,
others that he committed suicide)
and Victor Jara was arrested,
severely beaten and shot to death.
A week later a worker in the city
morgue recognized Victor's corpse
and contacted Joan who rushed to
claim her husband's mangled,
bullet-ridden body.

Although Victor had no official
position in the Allende government,
the power of his songs was such
that the new Pinochet junta immed-
iately called for the cessation of
any Jara music, the burning of
his records and the arrest of any-
one possessing his songs or poems.

Joan had to smuggle copies of his
tapes out of the country since the
masters were destroyed at the re-
cording studio in Santiago by the
authorities.

This is a rich, moving chronicle
intermingling the political up-
heavals of the time with Joan's
love for the gentle, gifted Victor.
Also offered herein are—wonder-
fully—many of his lyrics. During
the last weeks of his life, Victor
sensed the impending national tra-
gedy and, Joan believes, his own
death. This is reflected in one
of his last songs, "Manifesto":

My guitar is not for the rich

no, nothing like that.

My song is of the ladder

we are building to reach the stars.
For a song has meaning

when it beats in the veins

of a man who will die singing,
truthfully singing his song.

An audio cassette of Victor Jara
performing his songs is available
from Redwood Records, 476 West
MacArthur Blvd., Oakland CA 94609.
The cost is $7.98 plus $1.00 for
postage.

Poem for the Children of Nicaragua

" aisles eiigbew cate

Dear children of Nicaragua,

I see your faces
on the nightly news:
shy, dusty smiles

and eyes like ripe olives.

I want to reach through the tube

and cup your faces
in my hands,
and say...what?

that there is magic in my fingers

so that the bullets from the M-16s
will not rip your flesh apart,

will not pop your veins like balloons,

that the napalm

will not peel off your skin like an onion's?

What compels me to reach for you

through the screen?
Is it something innate

like a protective maternal instinct

or is it because

I know how the story will unfold.

I've seen this show before:

the naked little girl

with eyes like ripe olives
running from the schoolhouse,
the scream frozen on her face,

her little friends
burning behind her.

Dear, dear children of Nicaragua,

I want to crush your faces

against my heart.
I want to say,

"Don't worry, kids.
This show was cancelled
once before because of
poor ratings.
It'll never play

as reruns."
