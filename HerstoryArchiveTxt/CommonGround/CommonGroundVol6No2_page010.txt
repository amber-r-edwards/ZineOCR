The Library of Congress  
Needs Our Help  

by Judith Geer  

When you write to your Congres-  
sional Representatives about the  
many ills Reaganomics is currently  
injecting into our national blood-  
stream, do all of us a favor and  
urge their help also in restoring  
the $18 million recently slashed  
from the budget of our national  
library, the Library of Congress.  

The culprit in the decrease is  
the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act,  
and the result of the cuts for  
the Library of Congress could  
be disastrous.  

The Library of Congress is  
"to be closed on Sundays, on all  
evenings except Wednesday and on all  
Federal holidays. Instead of 77.5  
hours of service there are only 54.5  
remaining. Spending on new books,  
periodicals and research materials  
has been reduced 13%. Staff will be  
reduced by 300 from the current 5,200  
level." ("House of Library Cards...,"  
p. 2)  

Just what is the Library of Con-  
gress and why should we be concerned  
with its fate?  

First of all, it is  
a library which is  
public— all the public, not just  
scholars and/or government officials,  
which most national libraries in the  
world are limited to serving. It is  
also the largest collection of stored  
knowledge in the world. It houses  
20 million books including more from  
England and America than anywhere else—  
but less than half of its entire col-  
lection is books! The rest of the  
materials consist of photographs, maps,  
drawings, craft artifacts, musical  
instruments, sculpture, phonograph  
records (almost every one ever pro-  
duced in the U.S.) and countless other  
often priceless items.  

Consider the following: The Li-  
brary of Congress has “more maps,  
globes, charts, and atlases than any  
other place on earth...It has...the  
largest collection of motion pictures  
in America, more Civil War photographs,  
more personal letters in Sigmund  
Freud's handwriting, more Stradivari  
violins, more flutes, more handwritten  
copies of the Gettysburg Address in  
Lincoln's own hand...Not to mention  
Jefferson's rough draft of the Decla-  
ration of Independence (with Frank-  
lin's marking-outs to make it more  
readable and Adams' interpolations  
to make it more legal)." (Goodrum, p. 21)  

The Founders of our nation were  
book-lovers and as early as 1774, the  
Continental Congress used the resources  
of the Library Company of Philadelphia  
to do their research. When the ori-  
ginal Library of Congress was burned  
by the British in 1813, along with  
much of the rest of Washington, D.C.,  
Thomas Jefferson sold his personal  
library of 6,487 volumes to the nation  
at a cost of $23,950 to re-establish  
the Library of Congress. (Even  
though the entire New England Congres-  
sional delegation, including Daniel  
Webster voted against the purchase!)  
The Jefferson collection is still  
housed in the Library of Congress  
today.  

In 1897, the Library of Congress  
moved from its temporary abode in  
the Capitol Building -- where the  
tons of books and papers were stacked  
in the attic, the cellar, and even  
along the corridors between Congres-  
sional offices -- into its new home,  
a lavish, architecturally breath-tak-  
ing structure in Washington. It has  
since expanded into two annex build-  
ings as well. Today the Library of  
Congress provides services far beyond  
the original intent Jefferson's  
literary legacy portended in  
1814... The library:  

1. has created a national  
program for the blind;  

2. started the oldest, most  
active chamber music program  
in the U.S.;  

3. invented the Library of  
Congress Classification System,  
which most large public and aca-  
demic libraries in the U.S. use  
today to arrange their collec-  
tions;  

4. prints catalog cards at  
cost for libraries;  

5. operates the largest in-  
ter-library loan system in the  
country;  

6. maintains a legislative  
reference service which now  
answers in the neighborhood of  
2000 Congressional inquiries  
a day;  

7. houses the largest col-  
lection of Oriental literature  
outside the Far East.  

Librarian of Congress Daniel J.  
Boorstin has said, "After  
visiting your Library of Congress...  
you will feel richer than you could  
imagine any citizen to be." (Goodrum,  
p. 15) Please, write to your Repre-  
sentatives and Senators in Congress.  
Demand their support in restoring  
budget cuts to one of our national  
treasures, the Library of Congress.  
When we can spend $300 billion a  
year for bullets and bombs, surely  
$18 million for books is not too  
much to ask!!

Anti-Rape  
Task Force  

The Anti-Rape Task Force has been  
in existence on the U.B. Campus for  
eleven years. Many different services  
are offered to the students and commun-  
ity members, including a very visible  
escort service. People are escorted  
to their cars or dorm rooms from our  
location outside the libraries, on  
both campuses. Volunteers work in  
pairs and have bright yellow I.D-  
tags. They are located outside of the  
Health Sciences Library on the Main  
Street Campus, and outside the Under-  
graduate and Lockwood libraries on the  
Amherst Campus, from 8 pm until closing  
time, Monday through Thursday evenings.  
For those that usually walk or take  
public transportation home from the  
Main Street campus, a van operates every  
night of the week that picks  
people up outside the Health Science  
Library (look for the sign that reads  
"Anti-Rape Task Force Van Stop").  
You will be driven home, free of  
charge, in order to ensure your  
safety. You do not have to be a  
student to take advantage of these  
services.  

Many other services are offered,  
including educational workshops to  
inform people about the various  
aspects of sexual assault, political  
issues, and men and rape. All workshops are  
free of charge and open to the pub-  
lic. The Task Force is looking for  
other topics to cover in these forums.  

For those who live in the Univer-  
sity Heights community, there is a  
U-CARE (University Community Against  
Rape Emergencies) project, which is  
a network of safehouses that you can  
go to in order to make a phone call  
if you are in some kind of danger.  
Look for a bright orange telephone  
sign in the window of participating  
houses.  

ARTF tries to keep the campus  
environment safe by checking the  
lights all over campus on a monthly  
basis. The maintenance department  
is informed of any deficiencies,  
and there have been excellent results.  
Anyone who notices a light out, or  
a poorly lit area should notify  
ARTF, who will try to get it corrected.  

The newest project is the SHARE  
(Sexual Harassment and Rape Experience)  
Support program. ARTF will act as  
individual escorts for anyone who has  
been recently assaulted and would like  
some extra confidence when in the  
U.B. area. The Task Force is still  
looking for more people who are inter-  
ested in becoming escorts.  

If you are interested in any of  
these projects, or would like some  
more information on them, feel free  
to call the office at 636-3322, or  
stop by 120-F in the Student Acti-  
vities Center on the Amherst Campus.  
The Task Force would be interested  
in hearing from you.  

Bernadette M. Hoppe is the Director  
of the Anti-Rape Task Force, and is  
an undergraduate at U.B. in Pysch-  
ology and Women's Studies.
