COMMON GROUND  
ELEANOR SMEAL  

by Roberta Williams  

National Organization for Women  
President Eleanor Smeal hailed the  
decision to hold the 1988 NOW Con-  
vention in Buffalo. She praised the  
local NOW delegation for achieving  
overwhelming support for the windy  
city. Ms. Smeal expressed hopes the  
labor issues would be resolved to  
avoid reconsideration by the NOW  
Board to hold the convention else-  
where.  

The main thrust of Ms. Smeal's  
address to over 200 people assembled  
in the student union at Buffalo  
State College on October 9th con-  
cerned abortion. She claimed the  
Reagan administration and the right  
wing are attempting to outlaw abor-  
tion by filling over 100 judicial  
vacancies at the Federal, District  
and Appellate levels with radical  
right wingers. She accused the  
President of performing a “litmus  
test" to enable the administration  
to appoint only those judges who  
oppose abortion, affirmative action  
and civil rights.” She stated,  
"Abortion is about power and keeping  
people dependent," and expressed her  

fears that a reversal of Roe vs Wade,  

a 1973 Supreme Court decision that  
made abortions legal, was imminent.  
"People just don't know how close it  
is." Smeal warned that pro-lifers  

IN BUFFALO  

are trying to make abortion a very  
emotional issue with such tactics  
as the film "Silent Scream" and ac-  
knowledged Planned Parenthood does  
have a film in answer to "Silent  

Scream." Smeal said the number one  
method of birth control in the U.S.  
is sterilization, reasoning women  

don't want to be hassled so they do  
something permanent, and noted that  
other forms of birth control are  
under attack by pro-lifers.  
She called for a march for Reproductive Rights  
for Women on March 9, 1986 in Wash-  
ington, D.C., and Los Angeles to  
call attention to the need for safe  
and legal abortions. According to  
Ms. Smeal, "It's a march for women's  
rights and justice for all people."  
Ms. Smeal spoke about the class  
action suit filed against Metro-  
politan Life Insurance Company on  
behalf of plaintiffs in New York  
State, charging the company with  
discriminatory practices in life  
and disability insurance.  

She emphasized women must fight not  

only wage discrimination, but fringe  

discrimination by changing the laws,  
state by state, because it costs  
women dollars."  

The President of NOW attacked the  
myth that comparable worth would in-  
jure free enterprise. "NOW believes  

just the opposite,” she said. She  
cited examples in Washington and  
Los Angeles where pay equity would  
compromise only 2 - 4% of the re-  
spective budgets.  

Ms. Smeal expressed fears that

NOW CONVENTION HERE IN ’88  

Nancy Castro, President of  
the National Organization for  
Women, Buffalo Chapter, has  
announced that the NOW 1988  
National Convention will be held  
in Buffalo.  

"This should be a very exci-  
ting year for the convention  
because it's a presidential elec-  
tion year. And," she added,  

“we want to show the country  
what the Buffalo women's community  
is made of."  

It took a lot of hard work  
on the part of Buffalo NOW to  
convince both the national com-  
mittee and local officials that  
holding the convention here would  
be a good idea, Castro said.  

The first step was getting  
convention specifications from  
National NOW on how much con-  
vention and hotel space is needed,  
what kind of support services  
should be available and what  
types of information they would  
like on why women would want to  

come to Buffalo.  

Nancy Castro and Kathy Jackson  
then went to the Buffalo Area  
Chamber of Commerce to get the  
answers to those questions. On  
the day before they were to go  
to Washington to make that part  
of their presentation, they  
called the Chamber to get the  
information packet, only to  
find out that it hadn't been  
done at all.  

"Colleen Gaughan of the Con-  
vention Center and Kathy Jackson,  
convention chairperson, got on  
the phone and started making the  
calls themselves," Ms. Castro  
said. By the time the Buffalo  
NOW delegation left for Washing-  
ton, D.C. the next morning, they  
had gotten the information necess-  
ary and were able to put their  
own packet together.  

Buffalo was competing with  
New York City, Syracuse, Cincin-  
nati, St. Louis and Hartford to  
be the national convention site.  

Vice President of National NOW  
Lois Reckitt visited many of  

the possible sites. After a day  
in Syracuse and a day in Roches-  
ter, she arrived in Buffalo.  

"We, with the help of the  
Chamber of Commerce, rolled out  
the red carpet for Lois Reckitt,"  
Castro said, "The Hyatt Hotel  
sent a limo to Rochester to  
pick her up, and between the  
local NOW and the Chamber of  
Commerce, we organized a whole  
weekend's worth of activities--  
a trip to Niagara Falls, dinner  
at some local restaurants, meet-  
ings with local dignitaries. Ms.  
Reckitt did not, however, meet  
Mayor Griffin, though he did  
manage earlier in the week to  
give Sophia Loren the key to  
the city. Lois said she had  
never been as well treated as  
she was in Buffalo."  

After Ms. Reckitt's departure,  
Castro went to Washington for

"In the area of disability, women pay  
15% more than similarly situated men."
