reduced to such a wreck. And  
then the smile fades, and he  
becomes a stranger again. (p. 54)  

Yes, Robert does recover, but  
Ms. Duras' pain is almost palpable  
in this soul-baring account.  

Another section of the book,  
"Albert of the Capitals," explores  
the essence of power by relating  

the true account of the  
Resistance's treatment of an  
informer. Immediately after the  

liberation of Paris, the Resistance  
members dare to reveal their  
identities and become judges,  
juries and executioners for  
suspected informers. The power  
structure had flipped over and the  
persecuted had become the  
persecutors.  

A man named Albert, a former  
waiter at a restaurant called The  
Capitals, is accused of being an  
informer. He is brought by  
Resistance members including Ms.  
Duras to a vacant building in Paris  
and beaten to make him confess. A  
young woman named Therese directs  
the interrogation.  

He's afraid of dying. But not  
enough. He still goes on lying.  
He wants to live. Therese gets  
up. She's anxious, she's afraid  
it may never be enough. What  
could they do to him? What new  
thing could they think of?...You  

have to strike. Smash. Shatter  
the lie. The vile silence.  
Flood everything with light.  

Extract the truth this swine has  
in his gullet. Truth, justice.  
For what? To kill him? What's  
the use? But it's not just him.  
It doesn't concern him. It's  
just so as to find out. Beat  
him till he ejaculates his  
truth, his shame, his fear, the  
secret of what made him only  

yesterday all-powerful,  
inaccessible, untouchable. (p.  
134)  

The nonfiction entries in THE WAR  
are much stronger than the two  
short stories at the end of  

the book. Ms. Duras is at her —  

when she cuts open a seemingly  
ordinary, true event revealing the  
glistening truths inside.  

Joan Baez  

Baez, Joan. AND A VOICE TO SING  
WITH. New York: Summit Books,  
1987. ISBN 0-671-40062-2  

Joan Baez, queen of folksingers  
during the rampaging '60s, takes  
us on a sentimental journey through  

WITH. Her almost guilelessly  
written autobiography is filled  

with the famous names of those  
turbulent times, Dr. King and Bob  
Dylan being the most prominent  
among them. She takes us backstage  
on her tours; we follow her rocky  
marriage to peace activist David  
Harris; get to know her son  
Gabriel, about whom she is  
positively ga-ga; and read about  
other funny, poignant and even  
mysterious events in her life.  

Joan credits her parents with  
her ardent pacifism. They began  
attending Quaker meetings when the  
Baez family lived in Williamsville,  
N.Y., in the 1950s. By the time  
Joan graduated from a Palo Alto  
high school in 1958, and the family  
moved to Boston, her beliefs were  
deeply ingrained, just waiting for  
a chance to be expressed by her  
"achingly pure soprano."  

She began singing professionally  
at age 18 in the Club Mt. Auburn  
in Boston for the rousing sum of  
$10 per night. She fell madly in  
love with a handsome student and  
when she became rich and famous -  
which happened quickly - he  
couldn't handle her success and  
they parted. She became more  
popular and fell in love with Bob  
Dylan, unaware he was two-timing  
her with the woman who would become  
his wife. Joan married draft  
resister David Harris and when she  
was a few months pregnant with  
their son, David was convicted of  
draft evasion and sent to prison.  
When he was released two years  

later, she tried playing wife, but  
they separated when, among other  
things, he couldn't understand how  
she could have cut her hair without  
his permission. Among these joys  
and sorrows, "diamonds and rust,"  
Joan's social conscience burned on,  
getting strong, refusing to be  
snuffed out.  

She tells the now-famous story  
of being sent into the sleeping  
Martin Luther King, Jr.'s room to  
awaken him with a song. He wakes  
up, says, "I b'lieve I hear the  
sound of an angel..." and goes back  
to sleep. She admits that Dr. King  
was her inspiration and after years  
of marching with him and being  
transformed by his presence she had  
found it impossible to fully  
comprehend his death. Nine years  
after his assassination Joan began  
to reconcile herself to his loss.  

And now [Martin] as I write  
these pages about you, another  
nine years have passed, and I  
see that I still can't say  
goodbye, and I see that it  
doesn't matter, and I don't have  
to. What I was concerned with  
was not your flesh, but your  
spirit, and it is as alive for  
me today as it was when I sang  
you awake in the little room in  
Grenada, Mississippi.  

You, more than anyone else who  
has been a part of my life, are  
my hope and inspiration...I long  
to regain the sureness of  
commitment and direction to go  
back out on the streets again,  
and know that the most important  
thing in my life is to do God's  
will. I long to end the  
preoccupation with age and death  
and all the pettiness from now  
till then, and to know what you  
must have known when you said,  
"I'm not concerned about that  
now. I just want to do God's  
will."  

Every time I hear your voice, it  
brings me back to the foot of  

the mountain. I My e  

in the eighties I can't seem to  
find where the path begins.  
(pp. 113-114)  

Joan's tours are fascinating  
adventures. She went to Japan in  
1967 and had a strange association  
with U.S. federal agents there; to  
Hanoi in 1972 (not your usual tour,  
singing in the midst of  
carpet-bombing attacks!); to Spain  
in 1977. All this was interspersed  
with visits to Russia and Poland;  
with appearances at Woodstock and  
Live Aid; and as a participant with  
the Rolling Thunder Revue and the  
first Amnesty International tour.  
Joan has traveled almost anywhere  
her voice could be heard, talking  
and singing about peace and lending  
a hand to those less fortunate;  
battling anxiety attacks,  
loneliness, “absent mother's  
guilt," the FBI and the IRS. In  
her down-to-earth fashion she  
admits she's "not the Virgin Mary"  
and pokes fun at herself,  
especially her propensity for  
picking up young boys.  

The last time I saw Joan sing  
was a couple of years ago at  
Artpark. She looked beautiful and  
even though the voice was a bit  
huskier than during the "Blowin' in  
the Wind" days, it was still clear  
and bright. She not only took me  
back to the “old days" with her  
singing but renewed my energy to  
carry on all the good fights I've  
felt she and I and so many others  
have shared over the years. Her  
book gave me that same feeling.  

Sue Hubbell  

Hubbell, Sue. A COUNTRY YEAR:  
LIVING THE QUESTIONS. New York:  
Random House, 1983. ISBN  

0-394-54603-2  

Sue Hubbell begins her book A  
COUNTRY YEAR with a simple richness  
of word and phrase which aptly  
characterizes the entire text.  

There are three big windows that  
go from floor to ceiling on the  

PAGE 14 COMMON GROUND JANUARY 1989  

south side of my cabin. I like  
to sit in the brown leather  
chair in the twilight of winter  
evenings and watch birds at the  
feeder that stretches across  
them.  

I have lived here in the Ozark  
Mountains of southern Missouri  
for twelve years now, and for  
most of that time I have been  
alone. (p. xv)  

She actually describes five  
different seasons, from one spring  
through the next spring and her  
love of nature in all its intricate  
detail is reminiscent of Thoreau  
and Annie Dillard. Sue's cabin is  
located between a river and a  
creek, surrounded by woods, a view  
campground, a pond and various bee  
yards. Farmers in the area allow  
her to establish other bee yards on  
their land as the bees help to  
pollinate their fields. She is a  
good narrator of bee life and her  
admiration for the little creatures  
is obvious, although she admits  
that she will never understand  
them. There are other wonders of  
nature that she verbally explores  
in such a way that she can  
fascinate even a non-science major  
like me. For instance, ever  
thought much about chiggers?  

[Chigger] larvae must find a  
meal before they can  
metamorphose to their next  
nymphal stage. They crawl up  
blades of grass, brambles or  

bushes to find a suitable  
vertebrate host on which to  
feed...from a chigger's  

standpoint, a human is a poor  
host, but should the mite end up  
on one, it starts to climb to  
find a protected spot on which  
to feed. For this reason  
chiggers most often choose  
places where clothing fits  
tightly, and our itches are  
usually clustered around the  
ankles, crotch, waist and  
armpits. Some Ozarkers swear  

that the best way to  
conduct one's outdoor activities  
stark naked. Presumably the  
chiggers would then wander up  
one side of the body and down  
the other, discouraged by  
finding no suitable spot on  
which to feed. I have never  
nerved myself to plunge into a  
blackberry thicket naked, so I  
cannot report if this is true.  
(p. 65)  

Sue weaves anecdotes about her  
own past and her Ozark Mt.  
neighbors into this down-home  
treatise on natural life. She  
tells a story of going into town to  
buy a used universal joint for her  
old Chevy pickup and engaging in a  
mountain ritual of buying and  
selling.  

The salvage-yard man is a friend  
of mine, and I knew that buying  
the universal joint would take  
some time, just the thing that  
both he and I would enjoy on a  
rainy day. When I went into his  
shop he was cutting a junked  
Pontiac into usable parts with a  
welding torch. When he stopped,  
he pushed back his welding  
helmet and nodded to me. He  
poured a cup of coffee for me  
and another for himself. We  
talked about the weather,  
discussing the pros and cons of  
rain past, present and future.  
Then he wondered what I was  
a-needing. I mentioned the  
universal joint for my Chevy.  
No, no, he seldom got those old  
rigs in nowadays, and they were  
always stripped clean of good  
parts when he did.  

I have lived in the Ozarks  
twelve years now, so I did not  
say thank you and leave. I knew  
that so far he had just said  
howdy. I asked him how he was  
getting along with the 1934  
pickup he had bought and was  
restoring.  

"Not getting along worth a  
dam," he said. "Seems like  
folks come in looking for parts  
and interrupting all the time.  
Got me as fussed as a fart in a  
mitten." He looked hard at me.  

I took his comment for what it  
was worth and settled back more  
comfortably. (p. 21)  

He proceeds to unwind a long,  
funny story at the end of which he  
finds the truck part for her.  
Another time Sue stops in the local  
post office and asks a friend what  
the weather will be like.  
“'Supposed to be sunny today and  
tomorrow,' he said, and then added,  
''Course I just heard that on one  
of them little bitty import radios,  
so's I don't know whether to  
believe it or not." (p. 177)  

Sue writes about owls, making  
rhubarb pie, building a roof for  
her barn, cutting firewood, black  
rat snakes, her ex-husband,  
teaching her nephew to be a  
beekeeper and forming a citizens  
group to prevent a dam from being  
built in the valley. Every story  
and observation, quite ordinary in  
and of itself, takes on a fresh  
uniqueness through Sue Hubbell's  
warm, reverent descriptive powers.  
What a gift she has given us with  
this wonderful, gentle, poetic  
book. She reminds those of us too  
busy to notice the microscopic,  
mysterious treasures of life to  
pause and find joy in their being.  

We can be grateful for the lives  
of these four women and grateful  
for the courage and talent which  
has “enabled them” to share their  
lives with us. Through them we can  
marvel at the incredibility of life  
itself in all its rich diversity.  
The more women write about their  
lives, the more we can attest to  
our presence - our active,  
absolutely essential presence - in  
every aspect of existence. Herein  
lies the heart of herstory.  

Dear Common Ground:  

Day after day the news is filled  
with accounts of violence in  
Ulster, suicide car-bombings in  
Lebanon and the Ayatollah's holy  
war. Religious fanaticism left  
unchecked is pretty scary stuff.  
The local anti-choice faction's  
tactics have finally escalated into  
violence and an ugly display of  
anti-Semitism by these "good  
Christians." With the tacit  
endorsement of Mayor Griffin, these  
people have vowed that nothing will  
stop them: not the law, not public  
opinion, and certainly not common  
decency. Targeting Jewish doctors  
on Hanukkah is an outrage. They are  
calling abortion a holocaust and  
blaming it on the Jews. Does this  
sound familiar?  

Basic freedoms are not to be  
taken for granted when religious  
extremists have the support of the  
government. If reproductive freedom  
is lost, other rights are bound to  
be stripped away too. Many people  
are so sick of seeing Project you-  
name-it chanting away on TV night  
after night that they just ignore  
them. But they have gone beyond  
being merely annoying. Before  
dismissing the whole issue, take a  
good, hard look at them, and think  
about whether you want this small  
band of fanatics to decide your  
rights. If more people don't speak  
out, they will.
