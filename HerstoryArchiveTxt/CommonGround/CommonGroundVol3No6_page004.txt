According to a report from the  
National Center for Health Sta-  
tistics, sterilization has he-  
come the most widely used form  
of birth control. Only 24% of  
all women using birth control  
use the Pill, while 33% of all  
have had tubal ligation, hys-  
terectomies and some women's  
husbands or lovers have had  
vasectomies (11%). The Pill  
has lost much of its popularity  
due to the attendant health  
risks.  

Ortho Pharmaceutical Corpor-  
ation has been ordered to pay  
$5.1 million in damages to a  
3-year-old child and her mother.  
The judge ruled that Ortho  
should have warned users that  
use of their product Ortho-Gyno  
spermicide can cause birth de-  
fects in pregnancies that it  
may fail to prevent.  

Ms. Mary Maihafer and her  
daughter, Mary Wells, a child  
born without a left arm and the  
fingers of her right hand mal-  
formed, were expert witnesses  
in the case. The settlement is  
one of the largest product lia-  
bility verdicts for drugs.  
Three other cases against  
Ortho have been filed.  

Charles Dean, convicted of  
the abduction and molestation  
of a 10-year-old girl, has re-  
ceived a jail sentence of 37  
to 75 years. This is the maxi-  
mum allowable prison term and  
the judge who convicted him  
said that he will resist any  
attempts to have Dean paroled.  

Dean was stabbed by the vic-  
tim's father in a neighborhood.  

New research has uncovered  
one of the key mysteries about  
AIDS (Auto-Immune Deficiency  
Syndrome). Both French and  
American scientists, in two  
different research groups,  
have uncovered the basic gene-  
tic blueprint of the virus that  
causes this always fatal disease.  

Finding the make-up of the  
virus is the first step for  
many different projects related  
to curing the problem: effective  
testing, better research mater-  
ials, and finding drugs that  
inhibit the growth of the virus.  

The International Women's Day  
Coalition is proud to announce  
“Women in Buffalo: Where Do We  
Go From Here?”, a series of  
events to be held on March 8th

poets, and other performance  
artists) to contact EMMA at  
885-2285, Diane at 881-5988 or  
Cynthia at 634-4385.  

Saturday's events will take  
place at the Downtown YWCA, 190  
Franklin (the donation of the  
space is greatly appreciated!).  
The day's events will include a  
rally, then a variety of work-  
shops, a marketplace and bazaar,  
a panel discussion and closing  
ceremony to wrap up a great  
day.  

There will be an all-day  
children's program available  
free of charge.

HOT FLASHES...HOT FLASHES...  

...Soon there will be a National  
Museum for Women in the Arts  
in Washington, D.C. Their goal,  
according to president Wilhelmina  
Holladay, “is to raise the sta-  
ture of women in the art world."  
The core of the museum is 100  
works by women from the 16th  
through 20th century collected  
by Ms. Holladay and her husband,  
and hopes to highlight women's  
achievements and to encourage  
museum directors to buy and  
hang women's work.  

---Outstanding for 1985... Glamour  
Magazine has announced their  
Outstanding Young Women for 1985.  
These women, ranging in age from  
25 to 37, have been honored:  
Judith E. Bergen (MD Resources);  
Dr. Maria C. Correa-Freire  
(congressional fellow); Marie  
Farrell-Donaldson (Detroit);  
Evelyn B. Horn (Hartford, CT  
Correctional Center); Donna Jean  
Hirnmak (Consulate, Brazil);  
Army Captain Michelle Hughes  
Koehler; Denise Marcil (Denise  
Marcil Literary Agency); Cynthia  
Farr (Farr-Cox Communications);  
Lisa Ann Rogers (Advertising,  
Vail Assoc.); and Merrie Spaeth  
(VP public affairs, Republic  
Bank).  

...Finding a good therapist  
isn't always easy. There is a  
new booklet out, "Women and  
Therapy: A Consumer Guide,"  
published by the Federation of  
Organizations for Professional  
Women. The booklet costs $5.  
Checks should be made payable to  
FOPW and sent to FOPW.  

...A California court has ruled  
that a spouse who supports her/  
his mate while attending profes-  
sional schooling (lawyers, phy-  
sicians, accountants, dentists,  
etc.) is entitled to a reimburse-  
ment for that support, should  
the marriage end. The ruling  
did not entitle the estranged  
spouse to a portion of future  
earnings, however.

Pay equity, or comparable  
worth, is being studied by the  
Center for Women in Government  
at the State University at Al-  
bany, as a result of a collec-  
tive bargaining agreement be-  
tween the State government and  
the Civil Service Employees'  
Association. This study will  
attempt to determine if women  
and minority employees are  
being unfairly discriminated  
against by being paid less for  
their jobs.  

The concept of comparable  
worth says that jobs which re-  
quire similar skills, education,  
responsibility and working con-  
ditions should have similar pay  
scales. Some women and minori-  
ties charge that it is because  
they are women or minorities  
that they are deliberately being  
paid less than white men, given  
job titles which carry lower  
pay scales, or are tracked or  
pressured into jobs which pay  
less, rather than because they  
have a lack of ambition, or  
because the work is not as  
hard or demanding. If the  
study concludes that there  
has been pay scale discrimina-  
tion, the CSEA might ask for  
back wages, the wage scales to  
be made equal, or could use the  
data to file discrimination  
suits against the state.  

Shortly after Christmas 1984  
the New York Times ran an edi-  
torial about the famine in sub-  
Saharan Africa and world over-  
population saying “because of  
the Reagan Administration, there  
may soon be yet more mouths to  
feed."  

"The Administration has re-  
fused $17 million in aid to the  
International Planned Parenthood  
Federation because less than  
one percent of its total funds  
(but none of the Federal money)  
goes toward abortion-related  
services. Among other projects,  
that has wiped out the entire  
infrastructure of family plan-  
ning services in Ethiopia.”  

The piece further describes  
other family planning services  
in other African countries,  
cut or cancelled by budget cut-  
backs by the Federal government.  

The article goes on to say  
"Mostly death, then, will go on  
regulating family size in the  
world's poor countries. America  
is shipping tons of food to  
today's famine victims--but by  
denying funds to the federation,  
it is creating tomorrow's.  
Surely, President Reagan does  
not want to be responsible for  
such a tragedy, and he needn't  
be. Not if he starts by paying  
more attention to the needs of  
starving millions and less to  
the demands of a minority of  
ideological zealots."  

What is also interesting to  
note, however, is the $100,000  
that a federal program, ACTION,  
gave to the Massachusetts office  
of Birthright, Inc., an anti-  
abortion counseling service for  
women with unwanted pregnancies.  
Birthright encourages women to  
carry their babies to term,  
offers shelter to pregnant  
women, and provides counseling.  

The Network is a group  
of pro-choice organizations and  
interested individuals. Its  
primary intent is to foster  
communication between these  
organizations and to make  
a concentrated effort to maintain  
reproductive rights locally,  
statewide and nationally. The  
area of action being  
reactivated in the present  
administration is against the  
violence toward providers.  

Individuals and organizations  
are encouraged to participate  
in the activities being planned  
by the Network. Letter writing  
campaigns, lobbying efforts,  
demonstrations and workshops  
are in the works right now.

COMMENTARY  
STOP H.L.A. TASK FORCE  

With President Reagan's re-  
election, the local Stop H.L.A.  
Task Force is anticipating the  
next attack on reproductive  
rights to come from this admin-  
istration. We see the possi-  
bility of Reagan appointing  
anti-choice justices to fill  
Supreme Court vacancies as  
the most dangerous aspect of  
this. Fortunately, the Senate  
has to approve those appoint-  
ments, so we will start to lobby  
all the Senators to vote against  
any of these anti-choice people  
that Reagan nominates. We would  
like to start now to build a  
large grass-roots letter writing  
campaign to this end: to do  
this, we will need help. We  
would appreciate volunteers  
to help write these letters,  
as well as donations of money  
or stamps to mail the letters  
we generate. If you can donate  
either time or money, it would  
be greatly appreciated. Meet-  
ings are usually the first and  
third Monday of each month at  
210 Franklin Street, 4th floor  
library. If you can't spare  
the time, but do have a few  
dollars to donate, please make  
the check payable to "Stop H.L.A.  
Task Force" and mail to: Paul-  
ette Hammond, 1525 Amherst Manor  
Drive, Williamsville, N.Y.  
14221. For more information,  
call Paulette at 631-3967  
(after 5 pm) or Gail Wellsky at  
831-2969 (days) or 836-6204  
(evenings).  

LETTERS  

Dear Common Ground:  

Please remove my name from  
your mailing list. I will be  
leaving the Buffalo area soon,  
but I am enclosing a small  
contribution.  

I do however think that Com-  
mon Ground has failed to become  
a forum that truly represents  
the diverse voices of women.  
It seems to be run by  
and for a small clique of women  
and filled with poorly written  
sloppy poetry and articles on  
such topics as whether or not  
to shave legs or change a name  
rather than any serious politi-  
cal analysis. The January is-  
sue was a case in point. The  
best article - an articulate  
and carefully written reply to  
the hurried and simplistic  
article by Hoetzer and Cook on  
the Gender Gap, was buried in  
small print on a back page, while  
a vapid article on dieting got a  
full large print page.  

Another article on Woman of  
the Month - a rambling inter-  
view with Anne Montes, a nurse,  
used male pronouns throughout  
to refer to doctors, continuing  
a stereotype that many of us are  
challenging. Does she know that  
40% of all medical students at  
UB have been women for the last  
5 years?  

Putting together a news jour-  
nal takes a lot of work - and  
it requires creating a consti-  
tuency. There are many pro-  
fessional women in Buffalo who  
are committed feminists. I  
wonder if Common Ground speaks  
to them.  

Why not solicit articles from  
women law professors, sociolo-  
gists, the Women's Studies  
Department at UB, from lawyers,  
doctors, executives? Why not  
reach out to women's organi-  
zations and publish dates of  
their meetings: the YWCA, AWIS,  
the UB Women's Forum, women's  
church groups, student organi-  
zations, minority women's  
organizations - do they exist?  
And ask them to write articles  
about their organizations and the  
services they provide.  

A certain amount of down home  
folksy articles are fine - but  
there are many different women  
and we need more variety than  
Common Ground provides. Unless  
Common Ground can broaden  
its base and appeal it will  
probably not survive. And that  
would be a loss for all of us.  

Sincerely,  
Bonnie Richardson
