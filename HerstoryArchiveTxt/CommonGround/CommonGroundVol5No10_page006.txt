‘Lady Lyn’

by Razia Muhammad

“The Lady" is one of the finest
basketball players in the United
States.

She is Lynette Woodard, a native
of Wichita, Kansas, the youngest
child in her family that includes
one brother and three sisters. As
a youngster she was an avid sports
fan and watched basketball on tele-
vision regularly. Her parents were
always supportive of her deep interest
in the game.

Lynette blossomed, nurtured with
the belief that all things are possi-
ble. She grew up close to Wichita
State University, which has a fine
reputation in her chosen sport. Geese
Ausbie, her cousin, mentor and veteran
Harlem Globetrotter for twenty-four
years has his every move on the court
carefully scrutinized by Lynette.
Whenever she had an opportunity, Lyn-
ette practiced Geese's moves during
games with male players. At that
time she made the affirmation, both
silently and publicly, that she
thought she could become a Harlem
Globetrotter.

Possibility thinkers have a way of
making dreams and goals into realities,
and certainly the young lady from Kan-
sas is no exception. Lynette graduated
from the University of Kansas in 1981
with a remarkable list of basketball
honors to her credit.

During her freshman year she led
the nation in rebounds, and she aver-
aged 15 points per game. The next
year she was tops nationally in scoring
with an average of 31.9 points, and a
total of 1,177 points for one season.
She holds the National Collegiate Ath-
letic Association's women's scoring
record with an impressive sum of 3,469
points. Because of her outstanding
ability and achievements, Lynette was
the recipient of the Wade Award in
1981 for best women's basketball player.
Her number 31 uniform was the first to
be retired by the University of Kansas.
And in Los Angeles, Lynette was Captain
of the 1984 Olympic team that won a
gold medal.

After graduating from college,
Lynette pondered playing for the
Women's Professional Basketball
League, which, unfortunately, re-
cently folded. She did, however,
have the opportunity to play abroad
in Italy as a member of a women's
league for a period of one year.

Lynette feels that she has been
very lucky in her pursuit of ex-
cellence in sports. Wherever she
goes she encourages women basketball
players to work hard. The future is
bright for talented players and op-
portunities for women are growing at
a steady pace.

Lynette is presently an academic
advisor for students at her Alma
Mater, the University of Kansas.

She plans to work off-season conduct-
ing basketball clinics, participating
in lectures, and coaching as well as
continuing to be of service in her
role as an Advisor. Her work can
best be described as fun.

Lady Lyn has arrived. Her dream
came true. She has taken her act on
the road with ten other professional
basketball players who are known and
loved all around the world. Twenty-
six-year-old Lynette Woodard is the
first woman to be a member of the fa-
mous Harlem Globetrotters.

She faced stiff competition during
the try-outs. And she succeeded by
being chosen over twenty-two other
women. Her presence on the team has
made a spectacular impact, not only
for the Globetrotters on their 60th
anniversary, but for women and sports
worldwide.

A Different Kind of -

SPRING FEVER...

souped-up pickup trucks, looking for
a place to party and sometimes, for

by Joan Dickenson

All my life, I've been warmer than
the people around me. When they're
comfortable, I'm boiling; when they're
chilly, I'm opening windows; and when
they're huddling in sweaters and at-
ghans and drinking hot toddies, I feel
just about right.

Whether it's my rotund shape or
simply some metabolic anomaly, I love
winter and hate summer, and spring is
always a time of mourning. In icy
Western New York, when everyone else
is gleefully getting out bathing suits
and suntan lotion, I sing a dirge as I
fold away my beloved alpaca, mohair,
and wool.

Undoubtedly, one of my problems is
that as a fat woman, I feel most se-
cure when wrapped in at least three
layers of fabric. I have so much in-
trinsic heat, however, that I can't
wear a coat above 20° F., and I add
a sweater and long johns only when it's
below zero. Happily, in this climate
my long underwear gets a pretty fair
workout. But on the kind of days
we've been having lately, I'm liable
to be found in the cool basement,
panting and downing glass after glass
of iced tea.

Part of my aversion to summer has
nothing to do with temperature. With
my family, I live at the top of a
quarter-mile hill in the woods, and
our driveway is impassable from early
December to late March. That means
anybody who comes to see us has to
walk; and aside from a few loyal
friends, no one comes.

But come May, our narrow, winding,
steep driveway becomes a veritable
Delaware Avenue. We’re deluged with
uninvited visitors -- the dog census-
taker, Jehovah's Witnesses, political
candidates, people selling vacuum
cleaners, and worst of all, young
beer-drinkers who roar around in

something to shoot. Everything has
compensations, and the compensation
for being snowed in all winter is
privacy.

My main complaint about summer,
though, is heat. I've always believed
that no matter how cold it is, you can
somehow get warm. You can kindle a
fire in the stove, put on wool socks,
work up a sweat splitting wood, or
if all else fails, go to bed and
snuggle.

But when it's hot, you can't always
get cool. We have no air-conditioner
or swimming pool, and the only nearby
pond is muddy - more attractive to
catfish than to people. You can only
disrobe to a certain point. Come
July, I often find myself wishing I
could peel off my skin so the breeze
would strike the interior.

I'm also sorry the wood-burning
season is over. Of course I didn't
feel that way the year we ran out of
wood in February. We had to start
cutting trees within wheelbarrow dis-
tance of the house - and speaking of

“working up a sweat, try pushing a

barrowful of oak logs up a slope
through two feet of snow! But now
we know we need 18 face cords to get
through the winter. And as long as
you have enough wood, there's some-
thing cozy about coming inside to a
cheerfully snapping stove. There's
no such thing as cozy in July.

Then there's food. Certain foods
- hot chocolate, for instance - are
characteristic of January. The sum-
mer menu is quite different, and to
me, far less appetizing. I love to
make soup. There's something magical
about starting with a bunch of bones,
an onion, celery leaves, turnip bot-
toms, carrot heels, and parsnip tails -
and producing a rich, steaming broth.

As one who has practiced yoga
for many years at the Himalayan
Institute and elsewhere, I should
like to give a description of the
discipline. Information on the
Himalayan Institute of Buffalo can
be found at the end of this article.

Yoga is a lifelong system of pre-
venting the body and the mind from
being overburdened by the complexity
of living. By emphasizing physical
postures (Hatha Yoga) the body is
brought under perfect control; thus
we can attain a state whereby we are
able to forget the body and concen-
trate on our inner consciousness.

A powerful body is not necessary
for yoga (any person can improve);
nor is a powerful mind necessary.
Moderation is the goal. In Yoga,
mind equals the total of thinking,
feeling and willing; and although
brilliance is not required, stupid-
ity is fought against.

What follows is a concise summary
of the eight steps of yoga. The
English definitions of the Sanskrit
words follow in parentheses.
1. YAMA (the five moral abstinences)
Yama represents a serious intention
to control destructive tendencies
of the mind. They are comparable
to the Ten Commandments.

2. NIYAMA (observances of conduct
of character)
A. Sauca (physical and mental
purity) This includes inter-
nal and external cleanliness,
natural foods, truth in thought
and action.
B. Samtosa (contentment) One
must abstain from too much de-
sire to increase possessions or
status.

C. Tapasya (asceticism, perse-
verance) One must be able to
bear extremes, such as heat/cold;
joy/sorrow; success/defeat.

D. Svadhyaya (study of yogic
philosophy)

E. Isvara Pranidhana (devotion
to God) For some Westerners,
perhaps devotion to Goodness
or Humanitarianism would be
acceptable.
3. ASANA (seat) This is the posture
for meditation and for health. These
are the physical exercises of Hatha
Yoga. The ultimate purpose of the
Asana is to transcend the human con-
dition; i.e., attain immortality.
In the West, some of us may not have
the attainment of immortality as a
primary goal, but we might wish to
improve our condition. Through
practice of these postures, the body
comes under perfect control of the
mind so that concentration and medi-
tation can take place without being
distracted by the poor condition of
the body. The ways in which the pos-
tures attain this goal are by stimu-
lating the circulation, reversing
the pull of gravity, and controlling
vital energy.
4. PRANAYAMA (the practice of order-
ed breathing) Prana is “vital energy"
and pranayama means control of vital
energy. It corresponds to what
physicists call cosmic energy,
and includes energy in all
forms--heat, light, sound, thought,
etc. When we breathe, this energy
is absorbed from the atmosphere and
we can direct it to any part of the
body to relax and revitalize.

There is a close connection be-
tween a person's emotional state and
her/his breathing. If the mind is
tense, one usually finds that the
breathing is shallow, quick and ir-
regular; on the other hand, a re-
laxed mind brings about deep, slow,
rhythmic breathing. Thus, if we
force ourselves to breathe slowly,
we can induce relaxation and slow
down the heartbeat. We are bound
to be physically and emotionally
more stable as a result of this
practice of ordered breathing.
5. PRATYAHARA (withdrawal or con-
trol of the senses) In this phase
of yoga, the student learns to re-
gulate sensory input so that impres-
sions from the sensory organs are
cut off and do not distract the
mind from its observation of itself.
This is accomplished by withdrawing
energy from the physical body (mus-
cles and senses) and directing that
energy through the central nervous
system to the mind, thus preparing
the mind for concentration.
Voluntary control of the senses
gives one greater access to the ex-
ploration of higher states of con-
sciousness. In the second phase of
pratyahara, suggestion is given to
the nerves to unwind, and energy is
sent into the mind to be used for
concentration and meditation.
6. DHARANA (concentration) The
spiritual aspect of yoga (Samyama
or Raja Yoga) is comprised of con-
centration, meditation and samadhi.
The transition from one state to
the next is subtle and may not be
recognized by the beginner.
Concentration is fixation on a
single point for the purpose of
comprehension. The object of con-
centration may be external to the
body (a flame, a sound or an inspir-
ing object) or it may be internal
(a scripture, or concept of God).

7. and 8. DHYANA AND SAMADHI
Meditation is a continuity of mental
process on one object or idea without leaving it.

It is a state to be experienced
rather than explained; this is why
there is so much skepticism and
mystery surrounding this last state
of yoga. Samadhi or Nirvana is a
state of complete consciousness and
all other stages of yoga lead up to
it. In Pratyahara the five senses
are withdrawn and it is found in
meditation that the human mind has
powers of perception other than
those connected with the senses.

It is believed that people have their
own direct knowledge with which to
arrive at the essence of objects.

The Himalayan Institute of
Buffalo offers classes in Hatha Yoga
(beginning, continuing and interme-
diate), yoga for pregnancy, breath-
ing and relaxation, meditation, yoga
philosophy, psychology, science and
vegetarian cooking. Classes, lectures
and seminars present the basic con-
cepts and techniques that underlie
a systematic approach to holistic
health. Holistic medical care is
an important facet of the total
program offered by the Institute.
The Institute physicians are recog-
nized as leaders in this field.

All regular programs and most
classes are held at 41 Delaware
Ave., Buffalo N.Y. 14209 (tel: 883-
2223). Fran Manly is the Director.
Also, classes can be arranged at
other places and/or for specific
groups if enough people are inter-
ested. The Institute publishes over
40 books on yoga, meditation and
health, including two excellent
Hatha Yoga manuals.
