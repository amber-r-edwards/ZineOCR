CALL FOR MATERIAL: Writer-editor seeks women who have given children up for adoption—either legal or covert (for example, a child raised by another member of the family or a friend of the family as their own, without formal adoption procedures taking place)—willing to write or talk about their experiences for an anthology bringing together women's voices and historical, cross-cultural, legal, and feminist perspectives on the institutions, customs, and attitudes surrounding adoption. I hope to focus on the complex forces, overt and tacit, social and economic, brought to bear on women's choices or lack of choices in adoption situations. Inquiries from any other women interested in working on the anthology are also welcome. Contact: K. Kaufman, c/o Plexus, 545 Athol Ave, Oakland, CA 94606.

COLD WEATHER--cold weather is not only uncomfortable, it can be dangerous. If your body temperature drops below 94 degrees, you can develop hypothermia. Dress warmly and heat your home to at least 65 degrees. If anyone, especially an older person, has a weak pulse, difficult breathing, confusion, or slurred speech, check their temperature. If it is not above 94 degrees, get medical help immediately. This message is from the Erie County Health Dept., for more information call 846-7690.

PREGNANCY TESTING -- Do you have questions about pregnancy testing, health care while you're pregnant, or for your new baby, or other mother and child needs? Call the BABY HOTLINE (TLC-BABY or 852-2229) for free facts from the Healthy Mother/Health Baby Coalition of Erie County.
