i am not here  
to by-pass a moment's design  

life allow light and love to crystalize,  
snow and ice thought form  

softly together  

touching clinging  

holding to one another.  

this window allows me to see  
out to you,  

i embrace your warmth  
watch steam  

and make love to light.  
my thoughts follow  

a single drop of moisture  
journey  

collecting momentum  
to zig zag its way  
across this window  
@mxiver-ride  

that brings me to you.  

sweat and sparkle

season of white  

from this waking sleep  
i rise  
greeted to white winds.  
window screens attract countless patterns  
of clinging snow,  
an intricate spider web  
cornered -  
shows no sign of strain  
transforms  
into snow-crystal web. :  
a white storm blows  
distance - time - away.  
it gathers and falls onto itself  
a soft magical world. — e

WORDS FOR MY GRANDMOTHER  

We stood there  

on the hemp mats  

fake green turf  

covering the dirt.  

You in a casket - a shiny new car  

without wheels  

without windows.  

The priest said  

some ceremonial  
phrases - praising  

his god to his skies  

and inserting the name Helene  
like those personalized  
advertisements  

for the occupant.  

Will you subscribe to this?  

And then Mom turned to Jack:  
Cousin Mary Jo, the family nun,  
who was going to know  

what to say, who had  

some words for you,  

lost the procession  

on the skyway 12 miles back,  
Cousin Mabel must have had  
words when you could use them.  

No words now for Nana.  

FATHER, FATHER, FATHER, FATHER, FATHER  
MOTHER, MOTHER, MOTHER, MOTHER, MOTHER  
MABEL, MABEL, MABEL, MABEL, MABEL  

We left you there on the platform.
