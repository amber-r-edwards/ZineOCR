THE  

GAY AND LESBIAN COMMUNITY CENTER  
FUND DRIVE  

The Gay and Lesbian Community  
Center, recently relocated in a  
beautiful three-story building at  
647 West Delevan Avenue in Buffalo,  
is seeking all interested people  
to help with their Founders' Fund  
Drive to raise $11,990 by January  
2, 1984 to purchase the house.  

So far, response to their  
fund drive has been encouraging.  
They have started a Founder's  
club of people and organizations  
who have donated $100 each to the  
building fund. The building  
they are purchasing is a three-  
story house, with 5 separate con-  
ference rooms, a full kitchen, and  
a third floor that could be  
developed into meeting space.  
Many local groups are already  
using the space to meet, such  
as the AIDS Taskforce, Gay Youth  
Advisory Board, Metropolitan  
Community Church, 5th Freedom,  
the Buffalo Gay and Lesbian  
Library, and others.  

The G.L.C.C. is also looking  
for other people to donate $5 -  
$10 - $15 -- whatever they can --  
to help realize their dream of  
a community center.  

Common Ground agreed to  
assist G.L.C.C. in publicizing  
their fund drive, and to that  
end, we will give up to one  
page of space in our paper to  
list the name of, or a message  
from, each person who gives $5  
to the G.L.C.C. Fund Drive.  
$5 buys you one line (36 charac-  
ters and spaces). This can be  
a visible way of showing your  
support for the Center.  

If you would like to  
participate in the fund drive,  
send your check (made out  
to G.L.C.C. Friends Fund),  
and indicate the number of lines  

you are purchasing, one line, $5,  
two - $10, three - $15 etc., and  
print exactly what you would like  
printed in the paper. You must  
sign your name, even if you wish  
to remain anonymous. Send it to  
G.L.C.C., P.O. Box 1595, Ellicott  
Sta., Buffalo, New York. Indicate  
on your check and on the sheet with  
the lines you are purchasing, that  
it is for Common Ground publi-  
cation.

If you've got some time, we've got  
the place...any woman interested in  
being a friend of EMMA and choosing  
among such things to do as staffing  
the store, making displays, selling  
books at community events, should  
come to the open potluck dinner on  
December 4th. The time commitment  
is flexible, training is provided  
for whatever you may be interested in.  
If you are interested in joining the  
collective (becoming involved with  
the long-range planning of the book-

involve also. For more information,
