If the often bandied-about phrase,  
"What do women want?" were expanded  
into, “What do pregnant women want?",  
it would be the thesis of A Good  
Birth, A Safe Birth.

Co-authors Diana Korte and Roberta  
Scaer, each a mother of 4 children,  
posit that women today want as little  
medical intervention as possible in  
their labors and deliveries, and  
that most wish to have a greater  
voice in their maternity care.

The results of 3 surveys, which  
asked over 2,000 women (all of whom  
had given birth at least once) their  
opinions on hospital maternity care,  
provided the basis for this premise.  
The first of these surveys, entitled  
Maternity Options for Mothers (M.O.M.),  
was composed by the authors and ad-  
ministered in the Boulder, Colorado  
area in 1977. In fact, it was the  
first of its kind in the nation.  
These surveys uncovered much disat-  
isfaction, which the authors attri-  
bute to the great gap between doc-  
tors' beliefs and women's prefer-  
ences. In addition, increased use  
of today's new technology (such as  
fetal monitors and sonograms) both  
to challenge doctors and keep their  
work interesting has put concern for  
women's safety and women's enjoyment  
of their childbirth experiences on  
the back burner.

As a result of so much medical  
intervention, the authors feel that,  
"what we are losing here is the  
experience of childbirth at its best:  
An exuberant experience of enormous  
courage, effort and incredible  
pleasure."

So now that the reader knows what  
pregnant women want, what can we do  
about it? The thrust of this book  
is that women need to be careful and  
informed consumers. In fact, the  
authors remind us that, "A pregnant  
woman is a consumer for herself  
and her baby," and that "...hospitals  
are doctor-centered, not consumer  
oriented." So the reader is encour-  
aged to adopt this wise-consumer  
attitude toward choosing both a  
doctor and a hospital, especially  
in light of the fact that because  
"childbirth is an annual $8  
billion business in the U.S. today,  
there is a strong economic motiva-  
tion...to keep you as a customer."  
The bulk of the book educates  
women, in great detail, to virtually  
all the birth options available to  
them. Much space is devoted to  
finding "Dr. Right", and practical  
and specific suggestions abound.  
Korte and Scaer recommend such tech-  
niques as interviewing a prospective  
doctor in a consultation-only visit  
(that is, no vaginal exam): care-  
fully using body language to minimize  
the powerful male/dependent  
female dynamic in such interviews;  
sending your own questionnaire to  
prospective hospitals; asking obste-  
trical unit nurses to tell you about  
certain doctors; and, getting all  
the agreed-upon procedures down in  
writing, with your doctor's signa-  
ture, well in advance of your  
date. The authors even include  
a few sample questions that a  
woman might have with a doctor, in  
order to guide women to be assertive  
and thus be assured of getting what  
they want.

The reader is also reminded  
throughout the book to beware of  
popular trends and superficial  
trappings. For instance, nowadays  
many hospitals flaunt a birthing  
room or two. But wallpaper or a  
bedspread doesn't insure either a  
minimum of medical intervention or  
a positive birth experience. In  
fact, the authors claim that because  
such rooms are either underutilized,  
or when used still involve too much  
intervention, hospitals simply have  
them as a ploy to attract women.

Several important issues discussed  
in this book set it apart from the  
many childbirth manuals currently  
available. First, the authors  
strongly recommend the presence of  
a doula (a caring and supportive  
helper, often a close friend, sister  
or prospective grandmother) and moni-  
trice (your personal ob nurse, whom  
you hire) throughout labor and deli-  
very. The need for them is threefold:  
“for avoiding the necessary interven-  
tions in the hospital, for getting  
the options you want, and for recei-  
ving the pleasure you deserve."

Another unique topic is the con-  
nection between women's reproductive  
functions and women's sexuality. As  
the authors point out, since most  
sex research has been done by men,  
most of it has dealt with the study  
of intercourse. However, here an  
entire chapter is devoted to the  
pleasure—both sexual and other—  
that can be derived from pregnancy,  
birth and breastfeeding. And this  
is most welcome news to all pregnant  
women.

Finally, Korte and Scaer include  
a substantial section on what they  
call “the new pediatric scandal,"  
that is, the high percentage of  
healthy, full-term newborns who are  
put under bilirubin lights for new-  
born jaundice (a topic of interest  
to this reviewer, whose two babies  
were both under these lights).

Perhaps the only thing I would  
take the authors to task for would  
be their repeated mention of “hus-  
bands." To assume that all pregnant  
couples are married is unrealistic;  
indeed Korte and Scaer could have  
acknowledged those women who go  
through pregnancy and birth without  
their baby's father at all.

Although the information contained  
in A Good Birth, A Safe Birth might  
be a bit overwhelming for a woman  
pregnant for the first time, I would  
recommend this book to all women  
because of its thoroughness, its  
consumer approach and its frankness.

blood draw

by Bonita Penfold Raquet

the pull of blood monthly

draws me into images

of invisible suckling babes;

soft round buttocks,

sweet shimmering eyes

helplessly floating within;

my body compels me

to send my seed

into warm communion with his;  
fulfillment comes through a heavy belly,  
ripe for the delivery

of a long-forgotten maternal promise.

and only reluctantly  
do i refuse.

ALL THE HORNED THINGS  
For K.M.A.

We are sisters under a sign together  
Bullheads --the horned things --not the fish  
This time we nearly lost our lives

Almost didn't make it out alive

Put all our eggs in one basket again

And it all but done us in.

Sad-faced and limp, we sipped at soup  
Down at the mouth

No dimple smile from you

Deeper frowns ground into me

We made a pact to hold each other up

You'd think your old aunt'd

Learn something by fifty; wouldn't you?  
You shrugged a little hint of dimple at me  
On the verge of tears we bravely don't  
But desperately need to

Even though it might spoil the soup

God, how you used to scream in the playpen  
Those days I’d watch you when your Mama worked  
Your doll face covered with some chocolate mess  
A toy gun hanging from your dress

We could use a couple of screams now, honey,  
Couldn't we? --and maybe a toy gun or two

I never had much luck with crying  
Coming as it did to spoil the mascara  
And make the head ache:

But now, my closest thing to a daughter  
Maybe we both can try to cry in our soup  
Or maybe in a beer or two

It would do us good to emerge messy-eyed  
And empty

And I will be a wife again --somehow

And you will grow, your young heart

Beating fast with all your Stieglitz

Camera dreams, and I'll write the novel

Telling about me and you and all the women.  
Stumbling through. Bumbling into things

Unknowingly, like migrants to and fro

Over the globe of woe, looking for love.

-Joy Walsh

Writer's Note: "The poem/story tells  
about two women, one fifty, the  
other twenty-three, and they have  
come to a place in life where they've  
both had the shit beat out of them.  
The younger one physically --$400  
plus in doctor bills -- the older  
stupider one suffered only psycho-  

logical and emotional damage. Who  
knows the dollar value of that? It  
does add up. Shrinks, tranquilizers,  

etc. Ahem.”

LUNCHEON WITH A FRIEND

by Diane C. Prochownik

Color prisms

fragment my psyche  
into hard edged

mood auras,

jagged from reflected  
pain.

“Why me?" she says.

Negative ions of dissatisfaction  
clog the air between us.

I breathe in her depression.

“Why anyone?" I counter.  
Love and loss blow musty  
winds,

scented with guilt,

with self-doubt.

Painted plaster artifacts,  
the food we ordered sits  
between us,

untouched.

"Men!" she says,

self-destruct a sputtering fuse  
exploding in the tamped tight  
space.

I reel from the impact,

sucked into shifting instability.

She hurts;

I envy.

She has had;  
I have not.
