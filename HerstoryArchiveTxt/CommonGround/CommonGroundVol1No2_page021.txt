From Page 6

The virtues of rosemary - a tender,
shrubby perennial noted for its
breadth - include an evergreen-like,
shiny leaf which is pale gray or white
on the underside and perhaps one inch
in length; a small sky blue, pink or
even white blossom with a purplish
calyx; a sweet and slightly pungent
aroma; and tree-like roots which need
not delve very deep to survive. In
climes much harsher than, say, North
Carolina or Virginia or the Pacific
coast in this country, the plant is
potted to grace the home's interior
during the winter months. It is tradi-
tional to deck the halls with rosemary
for the winter solstice and related
holidays. Bees flock to rosemary, and
the honey, where available, is a rare
treat. The dried leaves of rosemary
are a staple to many potpourris. Rose-
mary jelly, prepared from an infusion
of the fresh leaves, is very special.
The fresh tops of rosemary blend well

with fruit and ‘as with .
and the dried Here 4's commonly o

used in sausages and with pork and
lamb, among others. Rosemary possesses
a gently stimulating property, which is
best appreciated in a tea brewed from a
teaspoonful of finely torn fresh tops
and a cup of boiling water. Oil of
rosemary may perfume liniments and
ointments; and women healers used rose-
mary to break a fever.

Oh, you might ask, have we not got
far from rosemary's spiritual qualit-
ies? The answer is no. In cultivat-
ing herbs for use and delight - and
rosemary is no exception - we come in-
variably upon properties of giving and
enrichment. These properties testify
strongly to what may never be fully
understood and yet lives within us
all. Perhaps rosemary is the true and
original giving tree. Whether it is
or is not important. Experiencing the
gentle bite of rosemary is bound to
provoke a flood of memory covering
table, dresser drawers and many a
memento. Where memory will take any
one of us is known only to she who
chooses to go with it. Unread or
read, remembering is its own experience
and reward. @
