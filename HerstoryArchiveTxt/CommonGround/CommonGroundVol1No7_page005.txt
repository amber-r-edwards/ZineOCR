Those who Suffer the Most:

by Joy Walsh

In Ireland there is a saying,

"It is not those who can inflict the
most, but those that can suffer the
most who will conquer."

One day Lizzie Murray just up and
sold the cow her father had given
her for her dowry, and booked pas-
sage to America. She sailed from
Ballina, County Mayo, Ireland, which
is the county adjacent to County
Sligo where Lizzie was born the
night of the big wind. This infor-
mation has been passed on from gener-
ation to generation and is the only
record of Lizzie Murray's birth.

Her father cursed her the day she
left. He said, "May you never find
a day of peace if you leave this
land." These were the last words
she ever heard her father say.

But along I
all of which had full
the parlor.

Doyle instilled a sense of success
in his children, and all of them did
well in their chosen fields—
except marriage. The children of
Doyle racked up an incredible score
of divorces and other tragedies.

Beatrice Doyle, my mother, and
Lizzie's last child, lost the sight
in her left eye while working in
Doyle's gas station at the age of
ten. Beatrice rushed home, blood
running out of the injured eye. A
horrified Lizzie got her on the bus
and into town where the doctor told
them Beatrice would lose the sight
in the injured eye.

That night little Beatrice Doyle
heard her father say to Lizzie,
"Well, who is going to tend the gas
station now, with all the boys in
the mines? For crissakes, she should
have put that in the hands of one of us well."

Doyle was a wide man and Lizzie's
marriage to him was a constant bat-
tle with him and with the painful
migraine headaches she developed.
She was twenty-nine when she married
and subsequently bore nine children,
two of whom died. Joe, her favorite,
died of heart failure at twenty-two.
Doyle and his family settled on
a farm outside of Butler, Pennsyl-
vania. The children called the farm
The Moon Place. Life was hard but
the children enjoyed the farm.

Doyle had forsaken his Catholic
background, joined the Socialist
Labor Party and the union, all at
once. A union organizer became a
constant visitor to his supper table.
Crosses burned on The Moon Place were,
along with Lewis, a constant plague
for Lizzie. She didn't know which
she hated more, the burning of the
crosses, or Lewis whom she called,
"the empire builder!"

When Doyle wasn't working in the
coal mines or organizing unions, he
ran a gas station and used to tell
his children, "There's nowhere to
go but high." In Ireland he had
said, "There's nowhere to go but high."
In Ireland he had

Variations on a Dream

Sometimes the dream goes like this:

Havana walls me in shadows,

the city streets are empty and narrower
than before.

I am eight or nine

Lizzie Murray

rice had to wait for someone to go
and get Lizzie's papers because when
she was asked where she was born she
would throw back her head and in the
thickest of Irish brogues say, “Why,
County Sligo, Ireland, the night of
the big wind, and I'm proud of it!"

When she died, Lizzie's children
fought over her possessions as they
had fought each other in the streets
of Butler, Pennsylvania—never giving
her a day of peace even in death.
Her father's curse had indeed come
true. Lizzie Murray Doyle never had
a day of peace in the new world, but
she always held her head high, con-
stantly repeating in the quiet times
when she tried to assuage the pain
of migraine: “Those who suffer the
most will conquer."

Although she turned back on her
heritage to all outward appearance,
her thick Irish brogue remained.

She would always condemn "Those
immigrants who maintained their
foreign accents," and she would con-
demn them in the thickest of Irish
brogues. She taught her grand-
children to say their prayers in an
ancient Celtic language, and sang
Irish songs of protest to them before
bed.

The American immigrant is often a
dual citizen in his or her soul, no
matter what the outward expression
of that dilemma is. There is an
orphaning which constantly pervades
the immigrant psyche, and may explain
the deep sense of loneliness which
is a constant in the heart of the
American.
