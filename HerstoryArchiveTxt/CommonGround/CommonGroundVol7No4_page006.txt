My Magic Pen

by Bonnie Johnson

When I first thought I would become a writer I went to Ulbrich's to pick
out a pen. I looked at many of them, considered the weight, the size,
the feel in my hand, and the sharpness of the point. I wanted a sharp
point, to get to the heart of things. Not for me the ubiquitous
ballpoint — I wanted a real, expensive fountain pen with permanent black
ink. And I found a Parker that seemed as though it would be everything
I wanted. I bought the pen, a bottle of ink and a brand new notebook
and hurried home to try them out.

I wasn't working then, and I had saved the money from the household
expense money - even threw in the change my husband had dropped down
inside the couch and chairs to be sure I had enough. I was in a therapy
group at the Institute for Transactional Analysis at the time, with
Jerry Paul as facilitator. And I kept talking about writing a book. I
was 38 years old, and had dabbled in art and music, but had never really
written anything but letters since I was in high school. Near the end
of the six months I spent in that group, I went off to buy my pen, ink
and paper - even though I still hadn't started that book.

When I got home I could hardly wait to put the ink in the pen and see
what words would come pouring out! I don't remember now what those
first words were — but there were plenty of words. This pen has served
me long and well. When my writing goes well I can write with a pencil,
any old kind of a pen, a typewriter or a computer. But when it doesn't
go well, or I can't remember how to get started, or what I want to write
feels scary or uncomfortable, I always go back to this wonderful pen.

The Place of Men
in the Movement

We are fighting

it out again,

this barbed question
that has

more than once
snagged us in
indelicate posture.
That this

has become a
question of

color, shreds

of ribbon

flapping

furious lavender
and green, red

and yellow, on
battle scarred ground
of brown, black,
red, yellow and tan,
suggests

we might press

to our shoulders
each other's tense,
weary head and,
plaiting these
ribbons into

our frazzled braids,
consider again

of what

trust is made.

Opus

It was a quiet day today, Florence
So still I stood for a moment
Just to rest my ears.

Three or four wild birds sang happily
around your last piece of home.

Riding back from your Requiem
I saw a dove -

They comfort me sometimes.

I didn't feel your family's grief
in the same way they did.
Unabashed weeping
but for others -

silent tears.

Tomorrow - maybe the next -
the cacophony begins again.

But the quiet beauty and
the soul-stillness
will remain with me,
my friend.

Suburban Girls

we were suburban girls
you and I
never wore dresses
from discount stores
had dates
with cars and college degrees
hung on walls
we had our own degrees
in English and political science
but we never intended
on being teachers or lawyers
only wives of doctors
and politicians

now we are without lovers
the men in our lives
are tomcats who are neutered
and have all their shots
shots against the diseases in life
immunization they call it

they called all the shots in life
like our fathers did
and are still calling them
in our dreams
big Daddy words
grown on our emotions

Food For Thought tangle in our thoughts
until we are seized by them

It's hard to be hungry and guided by our subconscious
eating all of the time doing what we learned
afraid to become full : what we thought best
To be hungry no more. over again
_over and over

and over

- again
