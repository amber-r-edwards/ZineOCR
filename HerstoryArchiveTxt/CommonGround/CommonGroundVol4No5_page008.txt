In the spirit of the New Year,

I asked members and friends of the
Common Ground Collective to respond
to the question, "What one thing
would you like to see for women in
1986?" Here are their responses.

Laura Bartlett: "My wish for women
is the freedom to be what they want
and the means to do it."

Elizabeth Stone: “I'd like to see
introduction and passage of some sort
of Equal Rights Amendment, and then
we'd all be able to celebrate.”

Joyce Schlifke: “I wish that the
women of 1986 can move forward with
good paychecks, respect if deserved,
and with the comfort of family and
good friends as emotional back-up.
With such encouragement, anything
is possible - peace on earth, pros-
perity, and certainly good will.”

April Hamlin: “I wish that in this
year women can walk down the street
and not have to worry about their
safety. Also, that milk cartons
can go back to being simply milk
cartons."

Sharon Sanhorn: “I'd like to see
women have two things: one is self-
respect, and the other is more
money.”

Margaret Snell: "I'd like to see
a more concentrated and combined
effort by all women's groups and
organizations to join together to
force the Reagan administration
to enforce Affirmative Action.
Affirmative Action is now a disas-
ter for minorities and women.
Secondly, we absolutely MUST
have an effort to unseat Clarence
Pendleton as "chairman" of the
Civil Rights Commission, because
he referred to women's desires for
comparable worth as ‘looney tunes.’"

Peggy Chinn: "Peace."

Susan Clements: “During the past
year, I had the chance to work with
a number of women in positions of
power and I noticed how these wo-
men worked against each other. I've
witnessed in-fighting, backbiting
and cliquishness. My hope for 1986
is that women in the workforce and
in society in general will try to
work together and view other women
as friends and supporters, rather
than enemies and competitors. I
also hope we can buy a typesetter
in 1986!"

Mary Schilling: "I'd like to see
more women get involved in politics.”

Charlene Wheeler: "I'd like to see
economic security in 1986."

Adeline Hinman: "Something great
for women would be unity. We have
so many things in common, that our
differences in philosophies could
be overcome. If we didn't have
so many factions dividing us, we'd
have better opportunities to achieve
our goals."

Roberta Williams: "I'd like to see
women in the New Year achieve a
greater role in the power struc-
tures in our society, such as the
church, the government (all levels),
the legal system and the law en-
forcement agencies. This passive
waiting for men to relinquish some
of their power only assures that
our great-granddaughters will get
a great deal of practice waiting.

"I'd like to see more
Also, I'd like to
see peace. If women were ruling the
world, there wouldn't be any wars."

Judy Seer: "My wish for women in
1986 is that people at least under-
stand that those qualities which
have been termed particularly fe-
male (being nurturers, comforters,
carers of children, etc.) are
strengths. My hope is that a con-
tinued commitment to this under-
standing will help to create an
environment more conducive to the
development of world peace.”

Anonymous: "I would like to see
women have greater representation
in elected office. There needs to
be a balance of women in elected
office and women in the profes-
sions. The movement toward women
going into professions is the first
step. The next step in empowering
women through the electoral process."

Kay Patterson: “Since I work every
day with women whose emotional well—
being has been threatened, my hope
for 1986 is for a world that is
more welcoming to our mental health
and our personal security and ful-
fillment."

Sharon Green: "First, I want more
men to begin to take our needs, our
strengths, and our life experiences
much more seriously. Secondly, I
want men to stop abusing - both
verbally and physically - women.

Sarah Slavin: "I firmly resolve, in
the absence of mutual leaning over
backward, to cease myself leaning
over backward; and I resolve further
still, in the event of mutual lean-
ing over backward, to look before
leaping after leaning lest I land in
a bed of Mammillaria woodsii (a
cactus with densely woven spines)
rather than Zygocactus truncatus
(Christmas cactus). Happy Landing,
Everyone!"

Gerri Baver: “I wish a better
sense of community in our women's
community."

Eleanor Rudolph: "I would like
to see, in 1986, a substantial
representation of progressive
women candidates in the Congres-
sional elections. I would also
like to see young women in all
roles take as active a part in
the Women's Movement as their
predecessors who leaped the
first hurdles.”

F.R. Mann: "My New Year's wish is
for women to use their insight and
love to nurture and heal each other.
We must seek peace and acceptance
of ourselves first, and then of
others, if women are to be partners
in a better future. I want women
to free themselves of false, un-
productive ideas about what is
possible & what's not, and look at
what is before making a decision."

Hope Hoetzer: "I would like to
see women grow so comfortable with
themselves and each other that our
dogmas - the inhibitions of our
own making - can be replaced with
love, humor and flexibility. I
would like us to share our dif-
ferences with the same enthusiasm
that we have when we share our
common grounds. I would like us
to have more peer empathy for gen-
tle strength."

Joanne McGrath: “I just don't want
to see women take any steps back-
wards.“

Bernie Lewandowski: “In 1986, I
wish that people, and especially
men who give lip service to equi-
ty, would finally start to live
it, and not just when it suits
them.

I also wish for women to dis-
cover themselves as valuable
human beings."

Ronnie Johnson & Heather Stratton:
"Good health: body, soul and mind;
sense of self-worth and esteem;
freedom from poverty and oppres-
sion.”

Joan Dickenson: "I'd like to wish
for the extras that make life a
good time, but that seems frivo-
lous when so many women lack the
basic things. So I'll wish for
all women food, work, love and
freedom from violence.”
