Speak-out

"How did the immigrant experience, and the experience of

being assimilated into American culture, affect you or
a woman you know well?"

Wanda Wells, Hamburg:

"I know a woman who came from Ger-
many in the early sixties. When she
moved here, work was easy for her, but
her social life nearly died because she
knew no English when she came. Her
children taught her English as they
went to grade school, but it took her
many years to become fluent in
English.

In Germany, she worked part-time
in a saw mill and also as a house clean-
er. When she moved here, she worked
only as a housewife, because her hus-
band was employed here. Even though
he had the same occupation here, it was
easier for them to live on one income."

Irene Barone, Tonawanda:
"First of all, the language was a
problem because I didn't speak any Eng-
lish. The first communication I
had was vague. After a year, I was
able to understand American people
better. In Germany, where I had grown
up, there was a strict, almost mili-
tary atmosphere. Here, people are much
more used to less authority; and there's also
a greater freedom of movement here.

In Europe, everyone absolutely idol-
izes the U.S. So it was eye-opening
for me to experience the U.S. first-
hand, because there are flaws in every
system. I came here almost with the
notion that I could pick up silver
dollars right out of the gutter!

Finally, when I came here, my sister

PAGE 20 COMMON GROUND MARCH 1983

Moving to the U.S., I found discrim-
ination, and that was foreign to me.
I haven't experienced it myself, but I
see lots of racism around. In Argen-
tina, racism is basically non-existent,
so this was quite shocking to me.

Another aspect of immigrating that
affected me is a sense of loss in terms
of the extended family contacts, and I
think my children are missing out on
this. With this comes a loss of a
sense of security. I often think "What
would happen to my children if I die?"
or "What would we do if my husband
died?" This worry seems to be preval-
ent among many immigrant women. Faced
with this alternative, I find that I
have been changed. It's more difficult
for me to function in my old society,
and I'd be sort of a misfit. This is
very disturbing to me, and in a sense,
we are in the middle.”

DUNBAR from p. 14

Dunbar alone isn't responsible for
the crimes of this country and its
space program (although she is bright
enough to know better), any more than
is any one congresswoman or soldier
responsible for U.S. policy in El
Salvador. But, it behooves each of
us to apply the old question of the
sixties: are we part of the problem,
or part of the solution? (My own
contribution as a reporter is dubious:
mainstream newspapers are well-known
upholders of the status quo. In fact,
since I see what's wrong, I am more
guilty than the blind...but it's
always easier to criticize than to
mend.)

Dunbar did not criticize NASA to
me or even express the slightest
doubt about its mission. Maybe she
has critical thoughts and doesn't dare
express them -- but that's disturbing,
too. Freedom of speech is foremost
among this country’s virtues. I sus-
pect any institution that muzzles
criticism, whether by indoctrinating
its workers, repressing them, or
choosing people who are unlikely to
speak out in the first place. When
women try to beat the male power
structure at its own game, we all lose.
