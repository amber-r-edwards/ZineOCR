THE ARTS  
HOLLY  

NEAR  

IN BUFFALO  

Reviewed by E.R. Mann  

Holly Near was in Buffalo last  
month after an absence of nearly  
four years. I've seen her in con-  
cert three other times, and her  
latest Western New York performance,  
sponsored by local groups, was the  
warmest, loosest, and most intimate  
that I have seen her.  

I recall seeing Near, perhaps  
12 years ago with Jane Fonda when  
they came to our high school. I  
don't remember what she sang...  

I do remember a girl with very long,  
red hair, a guitar and a voice that  
made me cry. She reached me—past  

my hearing and consciousness, directly  
into my heart...so directly that I  
wept, and I was not the only one in  
that high school audience whom Near  
touched.  

Near has touched many lives in  
her time. Her musical talent, her  
political awareness and her dedica-  
tion and drive have made her a coun-  
terculture celebrity and every so  
often the major media are forced to  
sit up and take notice of this  
remarkable woman.  

At Kleinhan's, Near sang many old  
favorites and some from her new  

album, "Watch Out!". Interspersed  
between tunes, Near spoke directly  
to the small audience about her life,  
her work and political concerns.  

Her earnestness, directness and  
warmth more than made up for her  
obvious tiredness, problems with  

the sound system and the small but  
enthusiastic audience.  

Near deserved to have more than  
the 600 or so who attended her con-  
cert. Those who went, however, had  
a very uplifting and enjoyable even-  
ing. Many coming out of the hall,  
and afterwards, said they felt a  
real high from her, her music and  
the warm feeling of the concert ex-  
perience.  

With Near were pianist Nina Goldin  
who treated the audience to an orgin-  

al piano piece, and Susan Freundlich,  
a well-known American Sign Language  
interpreter for the hearing impaired.  
Freundlich combines mime and dance  

in interpreting Near's material.  

The song, “Dancing Bird" in partic-  
ular showed all of us the expressive  
potential of ASL, and helped bridge  
some of the distance between hearing  
and hearing impaired people.  

Book Review  

Despairwork: Awakening to the Peril  

and Promise of Our Time.  

by Joanna Macy New Society Publishers  
$2.45 paperback, 32pp  

Despairwork: Awakening to the Peril  

of Our Time, challenges us to face  
our worst fears and depression when  
we think about environmental hazards  
and nuclear destruction. As we learn  
about global threats to our survival,  
our feelings need to be experienced,  
but should not be interpreted as  
psychological illness nor should power-  
lessness and isolation result.  

This essay teaches us to channel  
our fears into anger and action. It  
reminds us that none of us is re-  
sponsible for the threat to our  
planet and likewise, none of us alone  
can overcome the threat. Survival  
depends on individuals working to-  
gether. Like cells of a biological  
system, we can help the organism,  
Earth, live.  

Despairwork is an inspiring ex-  
planation of how various individuals  
have faced the threat of nuclear  
disaster by transforming hopelessness  
into healing power to preserve con-  
scious life. It can reignite sparks  
of hope in a burned-out activist.

This creates a situation in which  
society at large allows only feelings  
of shame and guilt about lesbian sex-  
uality and lesbian society allows  
only feelings of pride.  

Reality often lies somewhere in  
the middle.  

A lesbian who feels unable to iden-  
tify and express the full range of  
her feelings about herself may act  
them out in a number of ways.  

Some examples are:  

---feeling uneasy or fearful of  
others knowing her sexual orientation  
---hating or fearing people who in  
their self-presentation are obvious  
about their homosexuality  
---universally condemning hetero-  
sexuality  
---feeling lesbians are better than  
heterosexuals or  
---feeling lesbians are no different  
from anyone else  
---feeling uneasy with lesbians  
raising children  
---avoiding facing her sexual orient-  
ation by never feeling attracted to  
single, available lesbians  
---avoiding long-lasting relationships  
with other women so as to avoid social  
and family situations in which her  
life must be explained or covered up.  

The presenters were careful to  
point out that the problems of func-  
tioning as a lesbian in a homophobic  
society are real. There is a real  
need to make choices about coming  
out.  

There is a need to generate and  
validate positive lesbian identity. They identified  
internalized homophobia as being the  
magnification of the fears and sanc-  
tions of society beyond the limits  
of reality.  

The prescription for change was  
for lesbians to recognize, name and  
work through their own homophobia by  
allowing themselves room for all of  
their feelings, differentiating needed  
coping mechanisms from magnified fears  
and integrating their thoughts with  
their own feelings.

Potpourri from page 4  

Being a parent involves great love  
and many rewards; yet at the same  
time, it can also be oppressive and  
lonely for women who spend nearly all  
their waking hours in their houses do-  
ing the work that their babies, tod-  
dlers and preschoolers require. Thus  

Michele Miller's newsletter seems not  
only to be an ambitious venture but  
also one that promises to decrease  

women's isolation in the home. And,  

of course, lots of fun for the little  

ones evolves from its pages.
