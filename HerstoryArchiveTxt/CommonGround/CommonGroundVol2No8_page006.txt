BLACK FEMINIST  
POET  

by Lisa Albrecht  

Becky Birtha is a gifted woman  
writer who used to live and write  
here in Buffalo. In the early  
seventies, she was a member of the  
Women's Studies Poetry Workshop.  

She's now in Philadelphia, but  
thanks to Marian Perry at E.C.C.  
South, Becky will be reading at  
ECC South Campus, on the 2nd  
floor of the Library, at 2 PM  
on Thurs., May 3rd. (For more  
information, call Marian Perry).  

~~ About Becky? She's a black  
lesbian feminist writer whose  
writing includes poetry, short  
stories, book reviews and occasion-  
al non-fiction articles. Her  
first book, a collection of short  
stories, For Nights Like This One:  
Stories of Loving Women, was  
published by Frog in the Well  
Press in 1983. It includes 13  
stories about a range of women's  
experiences. You'll find strong  
and gentle stories about black  
women, white women, mothers, lovers  
and friends written in a readable  
style for everyone.  

Becky's poetry has appeared in  
many places: Sinister Wisdom,  
Conditions: Five, Lesbian Poetry,  
Common Lives/Lesbian Lives, and  
in Iowa Review's Extended Outlooks.  
Her poetry, like her short stories,  
touches all women's experiences.  

At 20, I began to know  

I wanted to grow  

Up to be a woman.  

Sensed the power in that word  
"Woman" like no one I knew  
To look up to  

At 23 I stood in a city field  

And reeled out 700 feet of string—  
Take a good look—  

You've never seen  

Anyone like this before  

Nor will you soon again—  
brown-skinned woman  
in a long skirt  
her kite flying higher  
than any of the men...  

Emma, 168 Elmwood Ave., will  
host a book signing and reception  
for Becky on Saturday, May 5th,  
from 2-4 PM. At press time, a date  
and location for Becky's talk on  
"Black Women Writers" is not yet  
finalized. Don't miss it! Call  
Emma, 885-2285, or Women's Studies  
at UB, 831-3405 for the info.  
Date should be set by mid-April.  

Don't miss Becky - her writing  
is important for all of us.

THE BEST OF:  

THE ARTS  

~O  

HOLLY AND CRIS  

by Susan Clements  

JOURNEYS  
Holly Near, Redwood Records, 1983  

PORTRAIT  
Cris Williamson, Olivia Records, 1983  

Who would have thought 10 years  
ago that the then fledgling women's  
record companies would be putting out  
"greatest hits" collections? While  
neither of these albums purports itself  
as such, Holly Near's Journey  
and Cris Williamson's Portrait are  
retrospective collections of songs  
each considers to be her best work.  
The glossy packaging and production  
indicates how far these companies  
have come.  

The extensive liner notes on  
Journey follow Holly Near's career  
from political activist of the 60's  
to political activist of the present,  
and details her involvement in Vietnam  
era protest, through her woman-identi-  
fied period to recent causes such as  
the anti-nuke movement and El Salva-  
dor. As a collection, this is a good  
introduction to Near's music. I pre-  
fer her personal style to her more  
political diatribes, but Near's pur-  
pose all along has been to integrate  
the personal with the political. New  
listeners will get a liberal sampling  
of each. Her voice seems to sound  
more strident on her political music,  
and has a warmer, richer quality on  
such musings as "Once or Twice," and  
“Winner Takes All."  

Holly Near will be appearing at  
Kleinhan's Music Hall on Thursday,  
April 5 at 8 P.M. This should be a  
fun concert to go to. I missed her  
last appearance here in 1979, and I  
don't intend to stay home this time.  
Tickets are on sale at EMMA, 168  
Elmwood Ave., and other outlets.  

Cris Williamson's Portrait has a  
peculiar new-wave cover design. I've  
found this album to be pleasant back-  
ground music. Again, it's a good  
sampling of her music, but the selec-  
tions have a sameness of melody and  
tempo with repeated listenings. I  
still like her early album, The Chan-  
ger and the Changed most of all. Her  
later work is a bit too cosmic for my  
taste. Of her later work, "Come Hell  
or High Water" is upbeat and singable,  
as is "Heart to Heart." Portrait does  
not have detailed liner notes, which  
would have been a nice addition.  
Williamson's voice, as always, is rich  
and full. Her early arrangements  
were less cluttered and cleaner sound-  
ing.  

It is significant that Olivia and  
Redwood Records have gotten to the  
stage of issuing these "best of" al-  
bums. I wish them luck and hope these  
two albums will bring them many new  
listeners.  

Both Journey and Portrait are avail-  
able at EMMA, 168 Elmwood Ave.  

Susan Clements is a member of Common  
Ground. She is a local folksinger,  
who has performed at various events  
in Buffalo for about 10 years.

Some people like the Gut not me,  
Yankees. They're a good team — I mean, feminist Union  
they won the world softball team,  
Geese and all.  

Some people like ret me  
the Chicago Cubs in Pied  
DecguaE. Get the Feminist Union  
it of not, Some people do live in  
the Midwest.  

Some people like But not me.  
the Red Sox. They're like, the  
Feminist Union  
there's due for a tie.  

In my opinion,  
there's really no attractive,  
any Sox.  

Not only is the  
Feminist Union  
tougher than those  
other teams...
