survive as an alternative to the

one viewpoint which has come out  
of recent discussions in the local  

women's community. It  
is presented  
here also to encourage  
discussion about this and other  

"feminist" alternatives to more  

traditional ways of doing things,

alternatives to the women who use  

them. ]  

Effective September  
Simple Gifts, Buffalo’s  
women in crisis, closed its doors,  
and ended the only feminist support  
system for battered women and other  
women in crisis in the Buffalo  
area. Begun in 1976 by three women  
who sought to offer the simple gifts  
of food, shelter and understanding  
to women who had nowhere else to  
go, the shelter served a great many  
women and children in its 7-year  
history.  

While treatment and support for  
both the abuser/batterer and the  
victim can be helpful to break the  
cycle of violence, it is important  
that these services be coupled with  
an analysis of the social roots of  
battering. Otherwise, shelters and  
therapy can do nothing about the  
underlying causes of battering:  
violence and sexism. Simple Gifts  
provided this analysis, indeed based  
its concept of helping battered  
women on it, and followed through  
with this in all it provided to  
women—from how the staff/counselors  
interacted with women seeking  
shelter, to the kinds of options  
and peer support that the shelter  

point of view; and much different  
from that of ‘the traditional helping  
systems which exist to get the  
battered woman through the experience  
and out the other side—which is  
vitally important work—but these  
systems do not seek to transform  
women's lives or the society which  
permits violence against them.  

By focusing on individual  
rather than social causes of bat-  
tering, on one hand, and individual  
rather than society-wide solutions  
on the other, traditional social  
service approaches do little to  
eliminate woman-battering.  

It was feminists who saw the  
needs of battered women, raised the  
issue in the women's community,  
and responded to the battered woman's  
plight, long before “the system"  
recognized the necessity of shelter  
for women, and the pervasiveness of  
woman-battering in this society.  

It was feminists who sought to  
remove the social "permission" for  
violence against women, and who  
pointed out to the "system" how  

it trivialized and devalued women's  
lives with unresponsive and/or  
negative attitudes toward battered  
women. Feminists see the necessity  
for including an analysis of women's  
class, economic and social position  
and conditioning, as well as the  
racism and homophobia of the "system"  
when approaching the atrocity of  
battering. The “system” in this  
broader sense, includes police, the  
courts, the church, hospitals,  
social service agencies, the volunteer  
community and government.  

Other programs serving battered  
women remain now that Simple Gifts  
is gone, and many feminists work  
in them, but Simple Gifts was an  
innovative alternative to the  
traditional “system”. Its non-  
hierarchical structure, emphasis  
on peer-support, and de-emphasis  
on the idea of credentialed  
professionals being the only ones  
who could help out a battered woman,  
were just part of the ways that  
Simple Gifts put their feminist  
philosophy into practice. The loss  
of this feminist focus, as well  
as the loss of "spaces" for battered

SIMPLE GIFTS CLOSING:  

women and free shelter for battered  

women who are not  

welfare-eligible,  

or are homeless but battered, is  
a serious blow to the Western New  
York Community.  

The story is not new. Similar  

processes have occurred with feminist  
attempts to deal with other forms  

of needs of a  

rape or incest.  
particular group of women, ignored  
by the traditional social services  
system, are brought to public  
attention by feminists. Support  
groups and crisis intervention  
services, usually operating volun-  
tarily and often collectively, with  
next to no financial supports, are  
set up to break the silence on  

the issue, and to provide victims  

with mutual support and a safe  
space.  

The programs are women-identified  
in philosophy and organization, often  
staffed by former victims and other  
concerned women who may or may not  
have professional credentials, and  
they are effective. As such support  
and greater numbers  

spread,  

become aware of the prob-  

lem, the attention of the traditional  
helping systems (law enforcement,  
social services, counseling, politi-  
cal) is attracted. Professionals in  

these fields, out of genuine concern  
for the needs of victims, or out  

of the inability to understand that  
people other than those formally  
trained could possibly be effective,  
or to protect their professional  
turf, (or hard-won recognition for  
their professional expertise) par-  
ticipate in setting up their own  
programs for victims. These are  
usually funded municipally or by  

state, and  

the funding is usually  

accredited or  

administered.  

Articles are published in  
professional journals, experts testify at  
hearings, new methods of intervention  
are developed, and professional  
training to implement these methods  

is instituted. At the same time,  

the early work done by women at the  
grassroots level is ignored, co-opted  

or derided. This early work is  
criticized: it may be felt that the  
feminism of these programs is alien-  
ating to potential users of the  
service, or funding sources, or in-  
fluential legislators; while ener-  
getic and dedicated, the feminist  
program staff is unprofessional, and  
therefore not qualified; the quality  
and extent of services is put down.  
Feminist analysis of the causes and  
dynamics of the problem, particularly  
if it involves reference to  
institutionalized male power over  
women and children, may be labelled  
as ‘hysterical’, biased or simplistic.  
Whatever the mechanism, the message  
to the feminist community is clear:  
“This issue and these victims are  
our property. We have the situation  
well in hand, and it's time for you  
feminists to bow out." This phenom-  
enon is in no way limited to  
battered women. Many times grass-  
roots efforts are turned over to or  
taken over by paid professionals or  
agencies. One of the ideas, after  
all, is to get their attention focused  
on the problem. Unfortunately, then  
the original group loses control  
over the philosophy and direction of  
the program. This is a choice many  
groups have made, or been forced to  
make in order to expand or just  
survive.  

But, do they (social services,  
the government) have the situation  
well in hand? What is the difference  
between a feminist approach to the  
problem of battering and an approach  
based on traditional social services  
philosophy?  

Feminists see the roots of violence  
against women in a male-identified  
system of government/church/family,  
and male ‘ownership' and oppression  
of women, as well as institutional-  
ized violence in our society. Wo-  
men who attempt to live out the  
traditional roles assigned to them  
by this patriarchal system are  
often victimized. Traditional ag-  
gressive male behavior gives social  
permission for many men to be abusive.  

For a long time there were two  
shelters serving the needs of bat-  
tered women in Buffalo. Haven House,  
the first licensed shelter in New  

York State, was formed in 1980 by  
the Erie County Coalition for Victims  
of Domestic Violence, a group of  

volunteers and board members of 22  
organizations and social service  
agencies (Child and Family Services,  
Catholic Charities, Salvation Army,  
YWCA, NOW, Buffalo Police Department,  
Legal Aid Bureau, United Way and  
Haven House). Haven House is staffed  
and directed by human services pro-  
fessionals, a feminist  
Eligibility for shelter  
is available to women from  
battering or child abusing situ-  
ations who are eligible for wel-  
fare. Women who do not qualify for  
welfare are accepted only as paying  
clients; homeless women who are not  
battered are ineligible. These  
practices, which result from funding  
requirements of the New York State  
Department of Social Services, have  
the unfortunate effect of limiting  
choices for shelter for these other  
women to such places as City Mission  
or the Salvation Army. These are  
unacceptable alternatives for many  
women, especially with children,  
the reason being that these shelters  
care for a large majority of men.  
Community support for Haven House has  
become more tangible in recent years  
and the shelter appears financially  
stable. This is good news for  
Western New York.  

However, at the same time that  
Haven House has been solidifying its  
position in the community and garn-  
ering support, Simple Gifts was  
faltering.  

In 1981, thanks to the VISTA and  
CETA programs, Simple Gifts had a  
staff of 14 engaged in counseling  
services, crisis intervention, re-  
ferrals, problem-solving, community  
organizing, supervision  
and coordination of  

others).  

At that time, the staff  
was down to a full-time staff  
of four, supplemented by volunteers  
and working long hours for subsis-  
tence wages.  
At the same time, requests for  

services were increasing. Because  

of its commitment to serving all wo-  

men regardless of social status, Simple Gifts did not  
seek state funds or licensing as a  
special care facility. Although a  
gateway to a more stable source of  
funding, licensing would also have  
presented women seeking shelter with  
narrow eligibility requirements,  

as in the case of Haven House. In-  
stead, Simple Gifts chose to rely  
on donations from private individ-  

One Community Analysis  

uals, churches, community organi-  
zations and foundations for finan-  
cial support. In this manner, they  
could retain more control over  

what happened in the shelter. In  
the meantime, the Reagan adminis-  
tration cut the CETA and VISTA pro-  
grams, all the while expressing its  
concerns about preserving the fam-  
ily; as the economic situation in the  
Western New York area went from bad  
to worse, Simple Gifts' situation  
grew accordingly worse.  

Staff members were exhausted and  
the calls kept coming. Vacancies  
on the staff were increasingly  
difficult to fill, and keep filled,  
due to low salaries. Much of the  
day-to-day staffing of the shelter,  
crisis intervention and counseling  
was performed by volunteers.  

At the same time, the Western New  
York community was becoming com-  
placent about the needs of battered  
women. There were two shelters in  
the area—if one folded, the other  
would pick up the slack. Because  
one shelter was plugged into the  
“system", the community could think  
the problem of battering was all  
taken care of, and need not personally  
concern themselves with the issue.  
This is a too frequent phenomenon:  
communities who are used to their  
social service needs being performed  
by the city, state, federal govern-  
ment feel that individual, personal  
involvement is not needed. Unfor-  
tunately, Haven House and Simple Gifts  
were set up in competition with  
each other, and there was nothing  
anyone at either facility could do  
about it.  

If Haven House is staffed by  
professionals and supported by  
state, federal and county government  
dollars, it must be better, right?  
Or at least that made  

battering  

redundant, to many minds.  

What is missing now is the fem-  
inist input and analysis, support  
offered by women who have been  
battered, and direct women's community  
support for battered women. Indi-  
viduals at other agencies may offer  
this or attempt to implement fem-  
inist principles, but the core of the  
agencies is based on a feminist  
analysis, the way that Simple Gifts  
was.  

Ironically, Buffalo's unique  
situation with two shelters for  
battered women may have helped  
destroy Simple Gifts, because of  
the competition that they found  
themselves in. In other communi-  
ties, shelters have been launched
