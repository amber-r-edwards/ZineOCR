EDITOR'S NOTE:

At 22, Leslie Anne Emick was a severely battered woman. At 23, she is
a single mother facing a felony trial, charged with first degree manslaughter
in the shooting death of the man who battered her. (See CG, Sept. 83)

Marshall Allison, by Leslie's statement at the time of her arrest, inflicted
physical, mental, and sexual torture on her, and the Buffalo News described
this torture as "gruesome and brutal."

On February 24, after still another beating, Leslie tried to get help.
When Allison discovered this, he battered her throughout the night; this
time he harangued her to commit suicide by morning or he would kill her.
In terror for her life, and on behalf of her children, Leslie acted.

Her attorney intends to raise the "Battered Woman's" Defense, which
has never been carried to the courts in this state. It would not only
set a precedent in New York State, but it would add to a handful of such
cases around the country.

On Thursday, October 20, in the banquet room above Mr. Goodbar,
the Leslie Anne Emick Defense Fund Committee held a
fundraiser, and the Buffalo community showed an
overwhelming support for Leslie Anne
and this issue of battered women.
