WORKING WOMEN

WOMEN WORKERS IN WESTERN NEW YORK:
EMPLOYMENT AND TRAINING CONFERENCE

Reported by Gerri Bayer, Catherine
Dill and E.R. Mann

This conference on the Buffalo
State campus on Friday, February
17, focused on the new Job Training
Partnership Act, which replaces CETA,
and reported on how women's economic
status currently stands, and what
the new JTPA could do to improve it.
It was funded by the Women's Bureau
of the U.S. Department of Labor.

The JTPA encourages businesses
and industry, in partnership with
local governments, to set up training
and placement for jobs for which
workers in the private sector are
needed. The states are given money,
controlled by the governor, to imple-
ment it.

The conference's focus on women was
appropriate because the number of
women currently in the workforce is
growing. It is predicted that two-
thirds of the incoming workforce
through 1990 will be women. In 1982,
two and one half million wives were
the sole support of their families,
an increase of 44% since 1978, and
almost 16% of all families are headed
by women only.

Since JTPA eligibility for service
targets certain groups of people for
help, including displaced homemakers,
women who receive Aid To Families
With Dependent Children and other
groups whose members are mostly women,
the conference planners hoped to
point out ways to make JTPA work for
women in particular. The goal of JTPA
is to establish programs which lead
to unsubsidized employment, by pro-
viding training at the skill level
employers prefer.

NATIONAL ALLIANCE FOR BUSINESS

Madeline Hemmings, Vice President for
Policy for the National Alliance for
Business, presented the outline of
the JTPA for the 100 or so partici-
pants. Participants came from labor,
government, social and community
agencies; from education, business
and industry; as well as people with
a personal interest.

Hemmings pointed out that unemploy-
ment is particularly disastrous for
women heads of households, and that
women heads of households are more
likely to be unemployed than some
other categories of workers. She
hoped that this sort of program would
leave "no additional mark or barrier"
to employment for a participant, a
reference to the disdain in which
many CETA workers were held, and the
general lack of enthusiasm for the
CETA program by employers.

Hemmings gave example after ex-
ample of areas where JTPA programs
successfully helped women train for
and obtain good jobs. She emphasized
however, that it is not easy to get
all the groups involved to work well
together. “What will it take to
make it work?" she asked. "The pri-
vate sector needs to look at JTPA as
a good, regular source of employees.
Government officials need to know
that it is good for the community...
and cost effective. Citizens and
voters need to know that too [so they
will financially support it], and the
staff and service providers need to
have the respect of all parties."

She also said that "the trainees
[need to know] they'll get out of it
what they put into it...and that
there are good job possibilities.”

THE STATUS OF WOMEN

To understand the status of women
in the workforce, one must know where
women work, what kind of jobs they
have, how much money they make and
just who these women are. Do they
work to support families? Are they
single heads of households? Are they
single? Do they work because two
paychecks are necessary to pay the
bills?

Despite the highly touted “gains"
women are making in the workforce, if
you take away the hype and myth,
where do women really stand in rela-
tion to men in the workforce for
earning potential and job advancement?

William Ganley from the Center for
Applied Research in Urban and Regional
Development presented a study of the
economic status of local women. It
was compiled by Ganley, Susan Woods
of the New York State School of In-
dustrial and Labor Relations and Ken
Rodgers of the Community Service Re-
search and Development Program at

Buffalo State College.

Their information, gathered from
various sources including the U.S.
Census Bureau, reinforces several
facts:

--that women work because they
have to,

--that women make less money than
men, even in the same occupations,

--that women in Western New York
make less than the national average
in comparison to men. (Nationally,
women average 59¢ for every dollar
a man makes. In WNY, women make 56¢
to the man's dollar.)

WHO ARE WOMEN WHO WORK?

"Women's working and participation
in the workforce is often attributed
to women's self-actualization," Gan-
ley said. "The truth is that women
work because they have to work. It's
an economic necessity...Households
maintained by women see the sharp

cutting edge of extreme poverty."

Women workers are 25% single, 5%
widowed, 11% divorced, 4% separated
from their husbands and 21% married
with husbands earning less than
$15,000 annually.

In 1947, 9.5% of all families were
maintained by women; by 1982 it was
15.3%.

As Hemmings had previously pointed
out, white, middle-class women can no
longer expect to build lives around
husbands and families. The women's
movement is not solely responsible
for this phenomenon, either. There
was a time when a white, middle-class
woman could expect to spend her life
taking care of children and, while
possibly outliving her husband,
she would probably die before the
youngest child reached adulthood.

Now a white woman, married at age
22, can expect to live 2/3 of her
adult life without children and 1/2
to 2/3 of her adult life without a
husband due to death or divorce.
Currently, 47% of all first marriages
end in divorce. Increases in life
expectancy with better health care
have had the greatest impact on a
woman's traditional jobs of mother
and wife.

In her speech earlier in the day,
Madeline Hemmings encouraged women to
assess their life-long economic secu-
rity needs.

“Underlying economic changes mean
that women must decrease the impor-
tance of marriage in their lives [as
their sole intended means of support],"
she said.

Ganley pointed out it is impor-
tant to put the facts about women
workers into context. The statis-
tical increase in women workers
since World War II has been used
against women as proof that they are
taking jobs away from men, that
women couldn't possibly be discrimi-
nated against because they are get-
ting so many jobs, that women working
outside the home are destroying "the
family" and a host of other complaints
which are not supported by the complete
facts, but which are nonetheless
trotted out every time women agitate
for better treatment.
