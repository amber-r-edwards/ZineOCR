Herbs are sometimes gardened for  
color; leaves usually are the focal  
point of a color garden, and then  
may offer tones of silver-grey. The  
flowers of herbs are frequently ex-  
quisite, and small, hence not so eye-  
catchingly colorful from a distance.  
Those herbs flowering red are excep-  
tions: amaranthus, bergamot, burdock  
(which flowers red-purple), dropwort  
(its inside petals are white), hound's  
tongue, lemon balm, motherwort (which  
looks red-lavender), pineapple sage,  
red flowered bladder, rest-harrow  
(which tends to pink), the sorrels  
(common, Mountain, and sheep), and  
swallow wort. One big exception is  
a herbaceous showoff, papaver rhoeas  
or corn poppy. Until this past  
spring two handsome specimens grew  
in Daphne's garden. A fast-growing  
crop of celandine squeezed them out.  
Daphne already has had the Burpee fall  
garden catalogue folded open to the  
poppy page; the celandine will have  
to move over.

Corn poppies may smell of opium,  
but are not opium poppies (papaver  
somniferum), which range in color from  
white to red-violet. Instead of a  
narcotic, corn poppies produce poppy  
seeds, minute charcoal blue delicacies  
that taste simultaneously of oil and  
nuts and that appear in rich pastries,  
and sweet vegetables such as  
peas, as well as in sauces, e.g., with  
noodle kuchen. Jeanne Rose's Herbal  
Guide Inner Health (1979) rates  
corn poppies high on consolation, prob-  
ably drawing her rating scale from  
Nicholas Culpeper who found a plant's  
capacity for sympathy important in  
healing some illnesses. Culpeper was  
an English apothecary who compiled  
The Compleat Herbal (1649), seeking  
to inform working-class people about  
simples at a time when preindustrial  
capitalism was driving many people  
off the land. Astrology was the basis  
for Culpeper's assignment of a plant  
to a disease for healing purposes. A  
sympathetic herb associated with the  
planet associated with the disease  
itself. The need for sympathy not-  
withstanding, Daphne is most interest-  
ed in corn poppy red.

More often we associate the color  
red negatively with the "big three"—  
Menstruation, Motherhood and Martyr-  
dom—when red may be experienced as  
the color of law and justice; of  
strength, struggle, anger, conflict  
and aggression; of the great mother;  
of growth, realization, sexuality,  
maturation, nurturing and love; of  
energy, spirit, heat, flame, blood,  
sap, life, will, healing and destroy-  
ing, and purification (see the Tables  
of Correspondences in The Spiral  
Dance by Starhawk, 1979). Nor is  
menstruation bad. Most women experi-  
ence it during their lifetimes. Men-  
struation signifies unused fertility,  
in short, one kind of creative power  
and potential that women may draw  
upon or not, so long as this power  
is unrepressed. Mothering is certain-  
ly not bad, indeed, is critically im-  
portant, although the situations to  
which many mothers and their children  
are subject are not tolerable.  
Martyrdom is the bad idea of someone  
certainly not female and also a means  
of diverting attention from courage  
and commitment to punishment and dis-  
solution. No wonder patriarchs have  
sought to dissociate women from the  
positives of the color red. Daphne  
believes women should take it back!

The corn or common red poppy actu-  
ally tends toward the orange, a very  
red-orange; the base of its showy  
petals is dark. So flamboyant are  
these flowers that sometimes they seem  
unreal: this spring Daphne saw a  
stand of red poppies and thought them  
made of paper. Her friend Karen back-  
ed up to show Daphne the poppies. This  
experience convinces Daphne that she,  
at least, needs more red in her life  
than is there, lest she someday overlook  
real justice or real strength, and so on.  
For beginners, Daphne's pentacle now  
suspends from a shiny narrow red satin  
ribbon. Daphne O'Keeffe (A  
Studio Book, Viking Press, 1976), is  
opened to Red Poppy, 1927. Oil on  
canvas, 7x9. (Height precedes width.)  
Georgia O'Keeffe has written that,  
given her druthers, she would have  
painted her single flowers life size  
rather than so boldly! She chose  
instead to startle New Yorkers  
into an awareness of the flower.  
She also may have painted, as is  
her prerogative, a papaver ori-  
ental rather than a papaver rhoeas.  
The poppy, however, still looks  
red:  
The meaning of a word—  
to me—is not as exact  
as the meaning of a  
color. Colors and  
shapes make a more de-  
finitive statement than  
words. I write this  
because such odd things  
have been done with me  
in words. I have often  
been told what to paint.  
I am often amazed at  
the spoken and written  
words telling me what I  
have painted. No one  
else can know how my  
paintings happen.  
And, finally, O'Keeffe has written,  
"I believe that to create one's own  
world in any of the arts takes  
courage."

Georgia O'Keeffe appears to say  
that people's minds get in the way  
of seeing what she has seen and  
painted/created or, for that matter,  
not painted/created. This statement  
brings to Daphne's mind women herbal-  
ists, among many other groups of  
women whose work takes on the  
botanist, medical philosopher of science,  
and readily awarded to women. This,  
however, may not be what Georgia  
O'Keeffe sees. To her the situation  
of the artist who is female must be  
most compelling. She has said,  
"Do men say, 'What is love in paint?'"  
She seems to imply that to know what  
she means, we need to look, not at  
but through her at the colors and forms  
she has produced.

Not only poppy red but also blue-  
green appear in the Red Poppy paint-  
ing—mixed amply with white,  
the edges of the red poppy,  
patch even sprays, or perhaps it  
clouds, a red poppy petal. The  
poppy appears 'colored' as much by  
sky-water-light as by the least  
refracted end of the color spectrum,  
red. The Oxford English Dictionary  
(OED) partly equates the least re-  
fracted end of the color spectrum  
with the poppy. (In its circularity,  
the OED does not mention that there  
are other poppy colors, even pink  
without any dark spots.) Georgia  
O'Keeffe's Red Poppy also appears  
'colored' by an intermediary color,  
red-orange. This poppy red (or any  
red) is not, however, literally a  
property of light itself or a prop-  
erty of a material such as cadmium  
red light oil paint, which is a  
red-orange. This poppy red is the  
creation of Georgia O'Keeffe.

The sky-water-light-red-orange of  
Red Poppy reflects the dark poppy  
center as a smudge of ashes. The  
poppy is nonetheless highly luminous  
and intense, as well as crimson-looking  
in some of its softly folded petals,  
and in spots bluer than that. The  
outside of the petals looks  
cadmium red hot and a trifle dull  
compared to the molten red turning  
violet spilling over one  
ruffled edge in front and welling  
up from within another further  
back. The globes at the base of  
the petals flow less intensely  
than the flared upper parts of  
the petals, in the manner of  
coals after a fire has died  
back. Fuzzy spikes of ash-like  
material shoot upward in short,  
controlled spurts. This core  
energy seems to suspend the  
poppy head above its stem, as  
a hot air balloon is suspended.  
Land is nowhere in sight.

Where it seems to Daphne the  
stem should be, there is instead  
blue-green streaked vertically  
with ocean green, with glassy  
green, glassy yellow-green, com-  
plementing flared and folded  
petals both, and toning down  
their heat. The side and bottom  
edges of the painting also confine  
the upper parts of the petals, by  
shearing off increments yet  
only the painting's top edge does  
not crop the petals. There is also  
an inner and entirely cropped set  
of petals that forms up, arching  
as if to catch the early slanted  
cast of sunlight. Indeed, the  
crimson-looking folds and violet-looking  
ruffle may be the glint of sunlight  
after all.

Red Poppy is not, however, as  
effusive as real poppies can be,  
especially when several grow  
together; the fall 1985 White  
Flower Farm garden book even  
suggests, "not too many of them,  
please—they are showoffs"  
(p. 57). (On the outside cover,  
the garden book does not practice  
what it preaches inside.) It has  
seemed to Daphne that the sun passing  
over the single poppy in O'Keeffe's  
painting might topple its head in a  
back and sideward swoop. Yet the  
petals of the single poppy are in  
some places hard edged; and the  
spring in the curve of the ring of  
outer petals suggests tenacity and  
toughness as well as discipline.

The probable placement of the stem  
(hidden by leaves) also guards against  
toppling.

There is more to this poppy than  
landscape-sized curvilinearity on a  
flat rectangular surface. If our  
universe is saddle shaped, as Daphne  
learned years ago in an earth science  
course, perhaps it looks like Georgia  
O'Keeffe's Red Poppy. Why not? Because  
O'Keeffe may not have intended Red Poppy  
to correspond between a saddle-shaped  
representation of the universe and  
the creation of her own world—any  
more than she may have intended it as  
a symbol of fertility in relation to  
her personal universe. Flowers may  
function as reproductive organs, but  
not all flowering plants produce seeds,  
many propagate vegetatively.  
Further, half of all plants do not  
flower, which is not to say they lack  
beauty. In any event, it is a painting.  
Poppy is no more a plant than it is  
itself red.

In the 1927 painting, Georgia O'Keeffe  
looks to have expressed in part as  
the swelling and growth of this poppy—  
volcano. (Here O'Keeffe magnifies the  
poppy, and also the nucleus and cyto-  
plasm.) Still, O'Keeffe has not  
literally painted a volcano for public  
viewing, although elsewhere she has  
painted mountains. And, she names this  
painting Red Poppy, not poppy-volcano.  
Undoubtedly she means red poppy when  
she says it. Supposedly she cropped  
flower petals in order to take the  
advice of one Arthur Dow: "Fill the  
space in a beautiful way." The  
results of O'Keeffe's cropping  
seem as much defiant as beautiful.  
The painting seems too red, blue  
and white to be considered strict-  
ly and only beautiful—this is the  
painter who states she does not  
mind her work being "pretty" but  
also states she has painted one  
cow's skull "as my joke on the  
American scene, and it gave me  
pleasure to make it red, white,  
and blue." Red Poppy is probably  
as defiant as it looks and it is  
certainly a limited, if visionary  
Keeffe.

This is what Georgia O'Keeffe  
means by the meaning of color, in this  
case, the color red. Fair to say  
she has made the color red her  
own.

A study done by the National  
Chamber of Commerce for Women reports  
that sex discrimination is not the  
only factor that holds women back  
in business. The report says that  
white-collar crime and corruption  
make it difficult for women to  
compete.

The report states the connections  
of "the old boy's network" of bus-  
inessmen, corrupt unions, and  
government officials exclude women  
from the upper levels of business  
because they fear a strong sense  
of rights and wrong in women.

Does anyone out there wonder how  
a soap opera heroine deals with a  
bedspread? I give it a lot of  
thought, especially while waiting  
to ransom myself at the checkout  
counter of the supermarket. There  
I stand, surrounded by rag mags  
with pictures of soap opera stars  
and headlines speculating on the  
nature of the upcoming season's  
storyline. Since sex is the prime  
ingredient in soap operas, my mind  
turns to the differences between  
sex in real life and sex in a soap  
opera.

For instance, each night when I  
prepare for bed there are certain  
obstacles between me and the sheets.  
Working up from the foot of the bed  
there is a crocheted afghan; a  
mother dolphin and her two babies  
(stuffed toys, silly!); a pair of  
needlepoint pillows, gifts of our  
daughter who understands how to  
make the finished product look like  
the picture on the package; and a  
pair of backrests, awkward over-  
stuffed creations, one of which al-  
lows me to work crossword puzzles  
comfortably on those nights when  
hot flashes drive sleep from my  
side of the bed. Under all this  
trash is the bedspread. My getting-  
ready-for-bed ritual requires each  
of these articles be removed to a  
temporary home where it resides un-  
til morning, when the process is re-  
versed.

Now, imagine a soap scenario.  
Satin has just gone out for a pizza. The  
doorbell rings. There stands this  
hunk with a hot pizza in his enor-  
mously capable hands. Who can resist  
a hunk and a hot pizza? Their eyes  
meet. (The hunk and Satin, not the  
pizza and Satin). "You ordered a  
pizza?" he mumbles absentmindedly.  
"Yes," she purrs, her breath coming  
in short gasps. Cut to the bedroom  
scene.

Two bodies are flailing  
about on the bed. Assuming a second  
"yes" was uttered at some earlier  
point, what happened between it and  
the consummation of their lust? Of  
course, they didn't stop to eat the  
pizza which lies cold and forgotten  
on the vestibule floor, dropped in  
the heat of passion. But did they  
stop clutching long enough to re-  
move and neatly fold a bedspread be-  
fore tumbling into the sheets? Or,  
like a firetruck, is Satin's bed  
kept ready for action on a moment's  
notice? No spread, no decorative  
pillows, no stuffed animals, cer-  
tainly not a crocheted afghan.

Come to think of it, maybe that  
explains the difference in the tempo  
of her sex life and mine. All those  
obstacles on top of my bed. Quick,  
where's my analyst's number? I'll  
continue this later... maybe.
