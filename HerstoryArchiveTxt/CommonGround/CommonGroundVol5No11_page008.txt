A feather in the cap of Buffalo's  
academic community in general, and  
U.B.'s Women's Studies Department in  
particular, is the recently published  
Feminist Scholarship: Kindling in the  
Groves of Academe. It is written in  
an amazingly collective fashion by  
5 women; 4 are currently teaching at  
U.B., and the 5th was formerly asso-  
ciated with Women's Studies at U.B.  

Ellen DuBois is an associate pro-  
fessor of history and has been coor-  
dinator of the Women's Studies Dept.  
Liz Kennedy, an associate professor  
of American Studies/Women's Studies,  
has been with U.B.'s Women's Studies  
since it began in the early 1970s.  
Gail Paradise Kelly is a professor

of educational studies, and Carolyn  
Korsmeyer is an associate professor  
of philosophy. Lillian Robinson,  
formerly of U.B., is now a visiting  
professor of humanities at Albright  
College in Pennsylvania and an affil-  
iated scholar at the Stanford Univer-  
sity Center for Research on Women.  

A generation ago, feminism as an  
academic discipline was unheard of.  
Classes in women's studies were just  
beginning to be developed. Feminist  
scholarship evolved as a result of  
the general climate of dissatisfaction,  
in the 1960s and early 1970s, with  
the status quo of many accepted Amer-  
ican institutions. Indeed, the  
authors of this book repeatedly  
remind the reader that this social  
movement was the root of feminism  
as a legitimate area of study in  
higher education.  

However, this new area of study  
entered a realm of long-established  
disciplines, ways of thinking and of  
questioning. Ironically, while many  
Women's Studies courses and depart-  
ments have opposed the traditional  
organization of academia because of  
its frequent omission and ignorance  
of women, these courses have also  
been built upon the traditional  
disciplines. It is this dual nature  
that intrigued the authors.  

The authors trace the changes in  
scholarship in anthropology, education,  
history, literature and philosophy  

that resulted from the influence of  
feminism. Their discussion includes  
everything from critiques of earlier  
academic writings, which introduced  
feminist thinking into these tradi-  
tional disciplines but which did  

so before feminism became a social  
movement, to an analysis of the  

number of articles on women and women's  

issues that have appeared in 50 of  
the leading scholarly journals in  
recent years.  

As they explored the development  
and changes that feminism has effec-  
ted in each area, they also struggle  
with the question of whether scholar-  
ship should focus on women's oppres-  
sion and subjugation or rather turn  
its emphasis to the accomplishments  
and activities of women, many of  
which have been previously ignored.  
In general, they show how history,  
literature and anthropology are  
the disciplines which most emphasize  
women's activities and achievements.  
For example, feminists interested  
in literature have used the bulk of  
their time and energies into unearth-  
ing “lost" women writers (resulting  
in such publications as the  
recent Norton Anthology of Literature  
by Women, editors Sandra Gilbert and  
Susan Gubar), and encouraging college  
English instructors to teach women  
writers.  

Although Feminist Scholarship:  

Kindling in the Groves of Academe  

is an erudite study, which will un-  
doubtedly become required reading  

in some Women's Studies courses,  

it also appeals to those outside  

the academic community. Anyone who  
has taken college courses in anthro-  
pology, education, history, litera-  
ture or philosophy (especially those  
of us who did so more than a decade  
ago) will surely find much of this  
book informative and fascinating.  

It is available at Talking Leaves  
Bookstore (3144 Main Street) and  
Follett's Bookstore (on U.B.'s  
Amherst Campus). Supporting local  
writers helps to justify the  
hardcover price of $19.95.  

DRAWING BLOOD  

by Mary Paleologos  

Rambo, The Terminator, Dirty  
Harry, Top Gun, Cobra, James Bond,  
Death Wish. Each time I go to see  
one of these films, I wonder: What  
do these movies represent? What are  
they trying to say? Why would any-  
one pay five bucks to see this  
garbage? And why did I just pay  
five bucks to see this garbage?  

After years of study and research,  
I've finally realized, as bloody as  
these movies are, they serve a func-  
tion in our society. They are train-  
ing films for the American male youth.  
They teach teenage boys what a macho  
man is all about and how to act like  
one in an emergency.  

Otherwise, little boys would never  
grow up and learn how to beat each  
other up, participate in barroom  
brawls, taunt gays, or treat the  
ladies like chattel. That would be  
tragic indeed.  

You see, in today's everyday life,  
we no longer have the classic hero  
types that a young boy can look up  
to: the cowboys, the mean-streets  
cop, the decorated war hero, even  
the neighborhood tough (at least not  
in suburbia). They're just not  

around anymore to teach the youngin'  
how to fly fighter planes, mow down  
villains, and play a good game of  
horseshoes. So we must portray them  
to our youth on the silver screen  
simply and clearly—with as little  
depth and dialogue as possible so as  
not to confuse anyone.  

It's hard for a teenage boy to  
cuddle up emotionally to the head of  
a corporation (sorry Lee Iacocca),  
or the Channel 7 newscaster. While  
Ted Koppel makes a nice role model  
for a future career, he just doesn't  
sound like he eats nails for break-  

fast. But Don Johnson of Miami Vice  
does. (At least his voice sounds  
like it.)  

Young men need action heroism to  
make their adrenaline run. And by  
that I mean shoot-em-up good, hang-  
em-high, and walk away lean and  
mean. They must have a dose of the  
reigning Mr. Bad leaving carnage in  
his path, or they just can't sleep  
at night, let alone function in a  
normal society. It's part of their  
hormonal changes.  

If it wasn't for these movies,  
young men wouldn't have the sense  
to go out and buy a gun to protect  
themselves against thieves, back-  

stabbers, Vietnamese and wild  

Indians. They also teach men how  

to use the English language sparingly:  
never use a word or phrase when a  
grunt will do nicely.  

So those of us who go to these  
movies and throw our hands over our  
face and self-righteously yell:  
"Oh, God, yuck! What is this doing  
to the children?" Remember, Clint  
and Sly and Schwarzenegger are doing  
it for the children. They don't  
want little boys running home cry-  
ing "Mommy, Bobby hit me right on my  
sore." Oh, no. Stand up and fight  
like a man, ya little punk!  

So you see, these movies are  
essential teaching tools. How else  
will the tradition of American  
machismo be passed down from gener-  
ation to generation? Come on. Do  
you want the U.S. to become a non-  
violent society, or something?  

What are you—unAmerican?  

NEWS NOTE: Women picketed the last  
stockholders meeting of Coleco  
Industries in Farmington, Conn.  
Protestors claimed that the company's  
new "Rambo" toys are racist and sex-  
ist, and that they promote violence  
among children. The toys are based  
on the popular movie. @
