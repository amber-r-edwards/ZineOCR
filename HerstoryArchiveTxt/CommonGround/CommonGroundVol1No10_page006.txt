Practical Suggestions to Prevent or  
Avoid Attack  

AT HOME  

OUTDOORS  

MAKE SURE YOUR DOORS HAVE GOOD DEAD-  
BOLT LOCKS. One or two are enough  
if you ever need to get in quickly.  
2. USE CHAIN LOCKS, but do not rely  
on them alone to keep someone out.  
3. DO NOT OPEN THE DOOR unless you  
know who is there.  
4. HAVE GOOD LIGHTING on entrances and  
walkways. Pressure your landlord  
to install them.  
5. USE CURTAINS OR SHADES AT NIGHT that  
cannot be seen through.  
6. HAVE LOCKS ON WINDOWS and use them,  
especially basement and 1st floor.  
7. KEEP YOUR HOUSE KEY HANDY. Have it  
out as you walk home, so you can  
get in quickly or use as a weapon.  
8. Use your initial and last name only  
on mailbox, in telephone book, ads  
or notices. Use the intercom in  
your building, or arrange a signal  
with friends if you have a buzzer.  
9. HAVE A PEEP-HOLE INSTALLED in your  
door if you can.  
10. Get a dog, if you can, especially  
if you live alone. One that barks  
a lot.  
11. DO NOT GIVE YOUR PHONE # TO STRANGERS.  
Take theirs instead.  
12. DO NOT LET STRANGERS KNOW IF YOU  
WILL BE ALONE, or not at home.  
13. HANG UP ON OBSCENE PHONE CALLS.  
Report them. Blow whistle or  
scream into phone.  
14. OPEN WINDOWS IN THE SUMMER, even  
though the breeze is nice, are an  
invitation to someone to break in.  

These are all strategies to make  
ourselves less vulnerable. We should  
always keep in mind, however, that it  
is men who are to blame for rape, and  
there are active, as well as passive,  
strategies we can use to make  
rape less likely. Many rapes are  
perpetrated by people we know, many  
times in our own homes. It is a mis-  
take to be in terror of “certain"  
neighborhoods or people who look  
a “certain" way, because we are then  
letting stereotypes get in the way  
of good, common sense.  
We should turn our fear into anger.  
Take a self-defense course, lobby for  
better legislation, protest unsafe  
conditions and become involved. This  
situation affects all women.  

Information from the Nyu Li Tao  
Collective  

Myth: Rape occurs IN PLACES WHERE  
WOMEN "SHOULDN'T" BE: DARK  
ALLEYS, PARKING LOTS, BARS.  
Fact: Rape can happen anywhere and  
frequently happens in the place  
we feel most secure: our homes.  
More than 50% of all rapes take  
place in the home of the victim  
or rapist.  

Myth: RAPISTS HAVE A SUDDEN, UNCON-  
TROLLABLE NEED FOR SEX.  
Fact: Rape is not a sudden impulse.  
Over 80% are planned to some  
extent in advance.  

Myth: Rape CAUSES NO BASIC DAMAGE TO  
THE VICTIM OR SOCIETY.  
Fact: Rape is a very traumatic event,  
and no one recovers from it  
easily. The victim goes through  
stages of reaction which often  
encompass several years.  
We are all affected by rape.  

Myth: Rape is a crime of passion.  
Fact: Rape is an act of violence.  
When we are afraid to go out at  
night, when we believe we must  
restrict our activities for our  
own protection, when we give our  
children ominous warnings about  
strangers, when we stay home alone at night,  
then rape is definitely affecting our  
lives, and we need to do something  
about it.
