A few years ago while researching
some long since forgotten project, I
stumbled across a magazine article
about a woman named Sylvia Beach.
Actually, what caught my eye was the
picture next to the article: there
was Ms. Beach standing in the doorway
of Shakespeare and Company, her bookshop

in Paris, and opposite her in the doorway

was the easily recognizable form of
Irish author James Joyce leaning on
his walking stick, myopic but with

a sharper tilt to his hat and a devil-
may-care slouch. I had never heard
of Sylvia Beach or Shakespeare and
Company but once caught by the picture
and engrossed in the article--filled
with the names of literary luminaries
who graced the Paris of the 1920s &
1930s and whose lives the shy Ms.
Beach had touched--I couldn't imagine
anyone not being hopelessly ensnared
by the time, the place, the people,
the events which formed the web of
this amazing woman's life. I quickly
found and devoured Ms. Beach's
charming autobiography, a splendid
biography of her by Noel Riley Fitch
and several other articles in maga-
zines and literary encyclopedias.

In looking them over again for this
article, I am at once struck by Ms.
Beach's gentle wit, exquisite taste
and most of all by the sheer adven-
ture of her life.

Ernest Hemingway once said of
Sylvia Beach, “No one that I ever
knew was nicer to me." (Fitch,

p. 16) Her "niceness" to the English,
French and American authors whose

work she fostered was partly due to

her upbringing as one of three
daughters of a Presbyterian minister
and his wife. Ms. Beach was born
Nancy Woodbridge Beach in Baltimore

in 1887. She later changed her

name to Sylvia, probably in tribute

to her father whose name was Sylvester.

In 1902, the Beach family moved
to Paris where the Rev. Mr. Beach
was to minister to American students
there. During their stay, the entire
family fell in love with France and
Sylvia, especially, was so taken with
Paris and Europe that she was drawn
to spend her life there. Well-bred
and educated but without a firm
financial backing, Sylvia nevertheless
persuaded her mother to invest her
small savings in a bookshop in Paris
which she planned to stock with
books by American and English authors.
On November 17, 1919, her shop,
Shakespeare and Company, opened its
doors and within a remarkably short
time its warm, witty little owner
was making literary history.

Within months of the November
1919 opening of her bookshop,
she would become a personality.
Within two years she would be-
come a literary leader. And
within six years she would be,
in the words of Eugene Jolas,
‘probably the best known
woman in Paris'—the ‘Sylvia
Beach' of modern letters.
(Fitch, p. 41)

Although Sylvia had had a yen to
open a bookshop, her friendship with
Adrienne Monnier was really the cata-
lyst which made her dream a reality.
Adrienne was a writer, publisher and

owner of a bookshop at 7 rue de l'Odeon

in Paris called La Maison des Amis
des Livres where Sylvia ventured one
day in 1918. Adrienne soon became
the love of Sylvia's life and the
two remained together until Adrienne's
death in 1955. It was through
Adrienne that Sylvia became friends
with the great French writers of
that time since they frequently used
La Maison des Amis des Livres as a
kind of salon. In her autobiography,
Sylvia says, “We heard Jules Romains,
in uniform, read his peace poem,
‘Europe.’ Valery talked about Poe's
EUREKA. Andre Gide read more than
once. Others who read for us were
Jean Schlumberger, Valery Larbaud,
and Leon-Paul Fargue. Occasionally,
there was a musical program with Erik
Satie and Francis Poulenc..." (Beach,
p. 14)

It wasn't long, however, before
the Americans began their literary
invasion of Paris and most of them
landed on the doorstep of Shakespeare
and Company.

The news of my bookshop, to

my surprise, soon spread all

over the United States, and

it was the first thing the

pilgrims looked up in Paris.

They were all customers at

Shakespeare and Company, which

many of them looked upon as

their little club...Every day
someone whose work I had

seen in the LITTLE REVIEW or

the DIAL would appear. Every

boat from the other shore

brought more customers for

Shakespeare and Company. Of

course prohibition and sup-

pression were not entirely
to blame for the flight of
these wild birds from America.

The presence in Paris of Joyce

and Pound and Picasso and

Stravinsky and Everybody...

had a great deal to do with it.

(Beach, pp. 23-24)

The American expatriates were the
nucleus of an artistic revolution, a
revolution that placed Shakespeare
and Company in the forefront of great
excitement and change. How to des-
cribe it, the Paris of the ‘20s and
30s? The Pounds, Gertrude and Alice
B., Sherwood Anderson, Hemingway and
F. Scott were there and all of them
were frequent customers at Shake-
speare and Company. Salons, readings,
concerts abounded. Paris at this
time was truly as Hemingway said, a
moveable feast.

But the one who was to bring
lasting fame to the shop and to
test the mettle of plucky little
Sylvia was James Joyce, known in
the summer of 1920 when she met
him for his DUBLINERS and POR-
TRAIT OF THE ARTIST AS A YOUNG
MAN. It was a sultry Sunday after-
noon when Adrienne persuaded Sylvia
to go with her to a party at French
poet Andre Spire's. When they ar-
rived, they were told Joyce was pre-
sent and Sylvia remembered, “I wor-
shipped James Joyce and on hearing
the unexpected news that he was
present, I was so flustered
I wanted to run away
into a room lined with the ceiling
with books. There, drooping in a
corner between two bookcases, was
Joyce.

“Trembling, I asked: ‘Is this

the great James Joyce?"

"“"James Joyce,’ he replied.

“We shook hands: that is, he
put his limp, boneless hand in
my tough little paw—if you can
call that a handshake."
(Beach, pp. 34-35)

Joyce came to her shop the next
day, signed on as a member of her
library and quickly became the most
illustrious member of the Shakespeare
and Company "family".

That fall, all attempts to publish
Joyce's new novel ULYSSES in Britain
or the U.S. had failed. One publish-
er after another refused the manu-
script on the grounds that obscenity
laws in their respective countries
prevented publication. Sylvia boldly
asked the departing Joyce if he would
allow her to publish his book and he
readily accepted. Typists were en-
gaged (a tricky matter since reading
Joyce's almost illegible handwriting
and unusual sentence structure was
a great trial), a printer in Dijon
was hired and subscriptions were
taken. Even many of the French
writers whose English vocabulary was

limited signed up for a copy to
support the “cause” of artistic free-
dom of expression so recently denied
in Britain and the U.S. After months
of re-writing, the published ULYSSES
was delivered into Sylvia's posses-
sion on February 2, 1922. Although
the book sold at a brisk clip in
Paris, it still could not be circula-
ted in the English-speaking countries.

ULYSSES into the U.S. and Britain took
place for years afterward until a
celebrated court case in 1933 secured
the right to publish and sell the
volume in the U.S. Sylvia and Joyce
eventually ended their professional
relationship but not before Sylvia's
dedication to Joyce's gifts and her
determination to see them displayed
had set the literary world on its ear.
Throughout World War II, Sylvia
remained in Paris. She was briefly
incarcerated by the Nazis and upon
her release lived quietly in a Pari-
sian youth hostel. Shakespeare and
Company closed in 1941, never to
open again. When Paris was liberated
in August 1944, it was Hemingway who
stormed into Adrienne's shop on the
rue de l'Odeon demanding to know if

all was well, then charging off
again “to liberate the cellar at
the Ritz." (Beach, p. 220)

In 1955, Adrienne, ill and
exhausted, took her own life. Now,
all of Sylvia's loves were gone:
Adrienne, Joyce and Shakespeare
and Company. She continued lec-
turing and writing until she died
alone in her Paris apartment in
early October 1962, at the age of 76.

Sylvia Beach's achievements are
more than that she was simply in the
right place at the right time. By
bringing together the artists who
surrounded her, by encouraging their
efforts and fighting for their rights

HORSEBACK RIDING
Contrary to the Official Preppy
Handbook, it is not necessary to
own a black velveteen hard hat,

riding jacket and jodpur boots,

though a heeled shoe is recommended

so the foot will not slip through

the stirrup and the rider will

have adequate control. Anyone can
spend a pleasant afternoon on scenic
trails and it is not necessary to
aspire to horse show ribbons.

However, a more devoted rider can
develop the skills which make this
sport competitive. I am only familiar
with the following trail, but for
others, look in the Yellow Pages
under “Riding Academies."

ACADIAN FARM AND DAY CAMP, 7980
Northfield Rd., Clarence Center,
741-2553. This is a working farm and

ages 6-12. Bus service is available.
They have lessons all year and in
the summer day camp, and have inside
and outside rings.
