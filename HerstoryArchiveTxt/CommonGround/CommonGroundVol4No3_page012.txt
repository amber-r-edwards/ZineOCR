We women

fill our lives
with things

to care for

Plants
Animals
People

Whatever
we are so
capable

of handling

Then we
consider

our bitterness
justified

Will you

take this day
to be your
lawful right

To love
honor and
cherish
forsaking
all others

to lie around
and read

with no need
to be sick

Attention:
Mr. C. Pelf
District Sales Manager

Dear Mr. Pelf:

Thank you for your letter of October 3 confirming the contact
made by your computer the previous Sunday afternoon. Even though
your computer was charmingly modest and referred to itself only
as a computer I would like to give the disembodied voice a name,
to facilitate this letter. I'll call it Harry.

First, let me say I was genuinely impressed by the state-of-
the-art sales concept of a computer mindlessly dialing its way
through AT&T's tangled web, heedless of the sanctity of a Sunday
afternoon. And Harry's sincere tone, with just the right touch
of deference, prompted me to leave my name and address for a
follow-up call.

Your letter of confirmation arrived two days later saying a
representative would be calling soon. The following afternoon
George LeJerque phoned and questioned my husband as to the nature
of my interest in your service. Knowing my idiosyncratic need
to speak for myself, my husband asked Mr. LeJerque to call again
after 5:30, at which time I would be home to talk with him; he
promptly agreed. That was two weeks ago. I'm still waiting.

Do I detect the tiniest trace of sexism here, your man willing
to talk business with my man, but not—God forbid—with a woman?
Tsk, tsk, as Miss Manners would say. Imagine the irony: a state-
of-the-art computerized sales campaign undercut by a state-of-
the-art jerk. One who equates a soprano voice with incompetency.
That makes as much sense as my equating Harry's anonymous, though
sincere and deferential voice with integrity.

But I digress. What are we to do about this uncompleted sales
pitch? I'm afraid I've been alienated, which in itself won't
cost anyone sleep. But here's something that should. How much
money do I have at my disposal? I could be dirt poor or I could
be a lottery winner with scads of money I'm itching to spend.

And if one woman—me—has received this treatment by your
organization, how many others and their dollars have been airily
dismissed by your staff? You'll never know, will you? Alas, it’s

or to feel
guilty

LIGHTING CANDLES IS A SOLITARY ACT

I lurk about the cathedral,
slip worthless change

in a locked wooden box.
Rows of flames reflect

back red glass.

I choose a discreet candle,
light it carefully

with a stick,

circle once the dark greys
and murderous old oil paints
and head home,

hoping no one has seen.

BIRTHRIGHT

Ignorance brandished from a man
square in stance

caramel flesh and Arabic curls
promises drip off your brow,
herbs from hot lands

emerge in your scent,

Sharp they are in panic

I diminish in your presence
centuries of authority attempt to rule,
you are alternately a horror
and a joy,

your birthright—

a man’s life without qualms

a woman pleads for existence.

an imperfect world:

THE EDGE OF SNOW

Your touch

blurs the edge of snow

ice, fragile forms

at each corner of blackness
your tobacco fills the room
carving protection,

No words of madness

circle and circle,

your talk etches

a palpable warmth

upon my skin.

Your presence strengthens

A watch lies on the table
nearby an ashtray,

morning softly wakens
around me

But a love of tomorrow
keeps me at length.

Terez Pepins

Sincerely,

Adeline Hinman

UPSTAIRS ALONE

Upstairs alone
I check off countries—

The Gambia, Bahrain, the Sudan—

from an imaginary list

of possibilities.
Downstairs I hear

your child announcing

its love, your voice
smooth surprise in return,
a gentle pleasure.

Our ages the same,

our times remote.
