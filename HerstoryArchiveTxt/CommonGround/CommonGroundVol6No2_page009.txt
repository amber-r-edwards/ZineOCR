Women's Bodies

by Sharon Green

We have but one body to carry us  
through life. It is our only true  
possession. We care for our bodies  
daily, giving them nutrition, wash-  
ing them, and grooming them. Yet  
most women feel, at best, awkward  
about their bodies, or at worst,  
ashamed of them.

Our culture teaches us to feel  
uncomfortable about our bodies.

We often use silly-sounding (or  
even derogatory) euphemisms when  
referring to parts of our bodies,  
rather than the actual names.

After all, doesn't "tit" sound  
ridiculous? And isn't the word  
“cunt" terribly base? Furthermore,  
we women go to great lengths  
to conceal our bodies, from  
clumsily holding towels in locker  
rooms, to clutching backs of  
hospital gowns, to half-suffocating  
nursing infants with draped blankets.  
Indeed, most Americans view public  
nudity as quite far-out, something  
that only those liberal Europeans  
would do.

I think that our society's  
double standards make it difficult  
for women to be at ease with their  
bodies. For example, publicly  
exposing our "private parts" is  
indecent and illegal, yet magazines  
and movies depicting other women  
doing so are easily accessible  
to any paying adult. Also, while  
men leer at and lay claim to  
women's bodies, many are still  
disgusted by the reality of our  
bodies. Many men will not have  
sex with menstruating women; others  
will have nothing to do with women  
who are lactating.

Breasts are the part of women's  
bodies that have been most exploited.  
We are encouraged to expose a great  
amount of our breasts, to titillate  
men, but no matter how low-cut our  
tops or our swimsuits are, God for-  
bid that we should ever, ever expose  
our nipples. They are forbidden  
fruit. Think how very difficult  

that makes life for the woman who  
knows that breastfeeding is cer-  
tainly the best way to nourish her  
newborn, yet who is petrified of  
anyone seeing her forever-hidden  

nipples. Regrettably, many women  
choose not to nurse their babies  
because of this fear.

But age takes its toll on our  
breasts. Many women are saddened  
by the sight of their sagging,  
wrinkled breasts. Also, the fear  
of breast cancer becomes a reality  
for us as we get older. Perhaps a  
mastectomy would be less devasta-  
ting if women were only dealing  
with having cancer and losing a  
part of their bodies, without the  
additional burden that we are  
losing our sexual attractiveness.

Most of us feel much more un-  
comfortable about our genitals  

than our breasts. These body parts  
are always concealed under clothing,  
and also largely hidden from our  
own eyes. I suspect that not many  
of us were fortunate enough to  

have mothers who told us all about  
our genitalia. Our genitals have  
for too long been reserved for men  
(and sex still often occurs in  

the dark), or for the gynecologist  
(when during an examination, we  

are at the height of vulnerability  
and discomfort). Few of us were  
ever encouraged to use a speculum  
to view our own genitalia. As one  
who grew up a relative stranger to  
her own body, pregnancy and labor  
helped me overcome my embarrassment.  
Even though many hands enter your  
vagina and many strangers view you  
spread-eagle, you get accustomed to

And during labor,  
modesty is the last thing in the  
world most of us care about.  
Despite ignorance about our  
bodies, many girls and young women  
experiment with masturbation. Yet  

this necessity.  

we never dare tell a soul. Even  

though masturbation is still taboo,  

this is how many of us stumbled upon  
our clitoris. This can be quite a  
surprise, since few of us were ever  
told of its name and location, let  
alone that it is an organ solely  

for sexual pleasure. And isn't one  
of life's injustices that it is more  
acceptable for men to masturbate  
than for women?

There's a lot we may not have  
been taught about our bodies, but  
we all learned about menstruation  
either beforehand, or more cruelly,  
when we first panicked over unex-  
pected blood. Nonetheless, most  
women feel discomfort or even shame  
toward our periods. Some feel em-  
barrassed purchasing tampons or  
sanitary pads. Most hide from the  
view of others when using these pro-  
ducts. We dislike the smell and  
sight of our own menstrual blood.  
Some of us feel an aversion to sex  
during menstruation. Yet we should  
remember that, historically, myths  
about menstruation have kept women  
in subordinate roles.

It's unfortunate that our society  
fosters such a disdain for women's  
bodies. We can’t have a very posi-  
tive self-image when we are dis-  
gusted by our own bodies. Yet the  
stereotypes, exploitation, and  
negative images abound. Let me  
end with a local example of misogyny.

By now, you must have seen the  
latest in yard decorations. I'm  
referring to those large, wooden  
replicas of a heavy woman, bending  
over (see accompanying illustra-  
tion). Meant to remind us of the  
uncomfortable stance we often  
assume when weeding or picking up  
litter, its message is insidiously  
twofold. At first glance, the  
viewer may be titillated by the  
woman's slip showing and the near  
glimpse of underwear. This lawn  
decoration clearly portrays woman  
as sex object.

Yet since our culture scorns heavy  
women, the observer's second and more  
lasting reaction is one of revulsion.  
Would anyone really want to see this  
woman's underwear or genitals? I  
think not. And lest we forget that  
rampant double standard, I have yet  
to see a similar yard ornament of  
a man bending over to weed, testicles  
bulging through tight trousers.  

As long as such exploitation and  
trivialization of women's bodies  
continues, how can we expect to  
feel good about our own?
