The Physical Exam

If you see your health-care provider for a specific complaint, she/he will usually concentrate on the area of complaint. The health-care provider will look for abnormalities: pain, swelling, odd color or redness, rigidity, slow response, lumps, fever, or sounds which could indicate need for further attention. She/he will also need specific information from you about the complaint: When did it start? Is it getting better or worse? What are the associated symptoms - fever (how high?), cough, pain, headache, etc.? If you have pain, where is it exactly, and is it sharp? aching? burning? what makes it better or worse? What medication(s), including aspirin, over-the-counter drugs and birth-control pills have you been taking? Are family or friends sick too? The more accurate information you can give, the better the diagnosis.

The following is an explanation of some components of a good physical exam. Hopefully, this will serve to de-mystify the process. Exams are put together so fluidly that you perhaps were never aware that each small action/movement was actually a specific test. This explanation does not include all components or specialized testing. Nor does it cover a breast or gynecological exam.

VITAL SIGNS

- general physical appearance: skin color, hair, hands, nails, palms, muscle tone, joints. Much can be learned about circulation, diet, whole person health.

- Pulse and Blood Pressure: how the heart is working, stress, hypertension and other general health indicators.

- Temperature

- Weight: especially dramatic weight loss which in children can indicate dehydration. This also checks growth development progress in children as compared with height.

EYES

- Moving eyes check Cranial Nerves (CN) III, IV, VI, and visual acuity - CN II.
- Look at general eye health: lids, conjunctivae, cornea, sclera, pupils. Reaction to light. Look inside eyes. An odd color, broken blood vessels could indicate problems. Possible to see signs of high blood pressure, diabetes, brain swelling.

EARS, NOSE & MOUTH

- Check color of ear drum, how well it reflects light, does it move if air is blown on it? Test hearing - CN VIII.
- Palpate (check by touch) for tenderness of nose, cheeks, forehead which indicates infection.
- Check sense of smell - CN I.
- Check lips, gums, teeth, tongue, mouth lining, amount of saliva, throat. Look for redness or white areas, gum disease. A smooth tongue could indicate vitamin deficiency. Check for lesions which could indicate cancer. Say "Ah" - checks CN IX & CN X. See if tongue is straight - CN III.
- Force mouth open against resistance - CN V.
- Smile - CN VII.
- Shrug against resistance - CN XI.
- Palpate lymph nodes (either side of neck) - pain or swelling could indicate infection.
- Palpate thyroid gland (base of throat), position of trachea (wind-pipe) and carotid pulse.

CHEST & LUNGS

- Check respiration. Listen to lungs by percussion (tapping with fingers and stethoscope) from the front, back, both sides, while taking deep, open-mouthed breaths. Listen for fluid in lungs, ragged breathing, wheezing. Measure diaphragm expansion (lung capacity).
- Palpate all four breast quadrants - check for lumps, abnormalities.
- Palpate lymph nodes under arms. Tenderness or swelling could indicate infection.

HEART

- Observe neck veins.
- Palpate over heart. Listen to heart over five areas with bell and diaphragm of stethoscope. Listen with patient lying on left side and leaning forward. Check for abnormal sounds, rhythms.

ABDOMEN

- Palpate the abdomen (stomach area) to check the position, "feel", texture of liver, kidneys, spleen and bowels, as well as reaction (pain) to the exam. With stethoscope, check bowel sounds and major blood vessels. Also check sounds of abdominal cavity by percussing.
- Test reflexes, vibration sensation, sensitivity to pain of muscles, feet, toes and ankles.
- Look for edema (swelling) in feet and ankles.
- Palpate muscles and joints.
- Observe gait while walking. Check if both legs are the same length. Check balance.
