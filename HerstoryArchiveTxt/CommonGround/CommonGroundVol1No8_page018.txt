Emma is many things, many women,  
many services -- these change over the  
seasons (our Children's Story Hour is  
discontinued until positive signs of  
Spring), but mostly this is a reminder  
to WNYers about the resources Emma - the  
Buffalo Women's Bookstore has to offer.  
In the backroom of Emma, we have baths  
with feminist massage; in the backlot,  
an all-woman moving company and garage;  
in the basement, the press that produces  
this paper; on the roof, towers for  
all-women 24 hour feminist radio and  
T.V. broadcasts, and a big dish to  
receive satellite communications from  
women around the world. Together we  
are rapidly converting the world back  
to womantime -- the 13 month year! So  
OK, April Fools (for now)!  

We have books by, for and about
