Poets Dye.

No Knife/Love 1983

Little Red Riding Hood was her favorite:

Wolves in her bed.

Her dream about Larry's

Severed penis

Frightened me

Because she does not consider him a man.

Should I be glad that I was there, in her dream of being assaulted
by a man with a knife

Relieved that I am witnessing the purging of self-hatred

That my love for Liz lets her admit that she has been raped

Or worried that I don't have one.

We can't have a baby together
Because of the way you love me
As a woman.

You hold me in your fullness
And I feel like a baby.

You caress me

And I am an adult.

Together we curl

Look at the ceiling

At the window

At the pillow

At each other.

Your capable soft hands

Which play the piano

Hold a steering wheel

Pour coffee

Fold around my neck;

We fill the room

With our sounds and scents of Paradise;
I feel your body

My fullness

That is not our baby,

We are lovers

And I hope it is enough.

gathering the scraps
from friends and family

to extend the ribbon
to make clear this statement

this is what I couldn't bear to lose
“these are the ones I love too dearly
these are the pieces of memories and lifetimes

this is what I need to say

we have to keep extending the circle
building the ribbon
linking our arms
fighting for our lives

in vigil at Greenham and at Seneca
we've stood in rain and hot sun
bearing witness at the gates
decorating the fences
making prayer of our songs

we cannot just stand by any longer

we have to stop the war machines
we can stop the madmen

we can give our children a future
we can still give them hope

we harvest the scraps
to piece together our dreams

we shall cherish
what is ours

THE TIME GRANDPA MADE PICKLED HERRING

Grandpa, just the other day, I was thinking about you.

It's been a long time since you died, you lovable old scoundrel.

A true Dutch sailor, you'd show my cousin Tommy and me
your bicep, with its faded tattoo of a hula girl.

When you flexed your arm she'd dance for all of us, all in blue,

while an unfiltered CAMEL dangled from your mouth.

Tommy and I delighted in making you angry,

just to hear you swear in English and Dutch.

But of all my memories, the time I recall you best

was the December you made a big batch of pickled herring
for New Year's.

In Grandma's enameled white kitchen, you'd chopped onions, saying:
"Dot's tradition, dot's good luck, to eat dot pickled herring

when it strikes midnight, Noo Years."

As you took out the smelly garbage of fish heads and onion skins,

Tommy and I locked you outside in your sleeveless undershirt.
"Don't close dot door,” you said, so we did.

Safe on the other side in the pantry, we laughed

at your cursing and gesturing in the December chill,
unable to open the pantry door from the inside.

When Grandma came home, let you in, you never spanked us,
just kept saying: "Goddamn kids, you Goddamn kids."

Tommy and I will never forget you, Grandpa,

for not thrashing us.

And nobody ever made pickled herring as good as you.

I’ve never been able to eat any since you died.

Grace When Bone Gives Way

for Daddy

one year shy of eighty
my father rides
a humble horse

his crooked foot
plows
the stubborn grave

his withered hand
waves wan greeting
holds up his firm

farewell

Dimmie Canfield

In the most remote room

on the white wall

by the stairs that lead

down to the porch

to the garden-- where Spring
is grey and purple

where winter covers

the bird bath with wind

and rage now

and the fireplace you built
(according to the photograph)
when you used to build

is filled with dry leaves
growing wet and layered

A Letter My Father Will Never Read

meets

like seashells in an ocean of ice--

in this room
that I've missed every year
or avoided
whose doorway, I thought, led
to nowhere
on the wall by the stairs

I Am A Woman a child asleep in your arms--
a map of Sicily

I Am A Woman

that I dreamt you carried me up,

in remembering Hiroshima
we are the peaceweavers

this ribbon is our lives

Joyce Kessel
Sunday Night

I will throw away all the lists I've written
but years from now we'll still need
the same things.

We'll break plates

bones, promises.

Maybe we'll have a child

to care for,

What will ever change for us?
Loneliness-- the phone

rings-- a warm kiss,

half-hearted kiss,

no kiss at all.

Luggage, airplanes,

coming home,

new carpeting,

new baby, older parents--

a fire in the kitchen,

snow on the lawn.

PAGE 4 COMMON GROUND JUNE 1986

A bonafide
dignified
qualified
never terrified
black woman at that.
I am not afraid
to walk alone
to talk alone
to speak my mind,
and carry myself in a bold
manner all the time.
I am not afraid to reach out
and search for the truth.
If I find it, good
If I don't
I'll just keep searching.

behind glass

each place each particular
province's name hand-drawn

in sea-washed calligraphy

an old map of an older island
this is all I know

and that grandfather came from
Palermo

that our sea is the Mediterranean
that as grandpop, in America, was dying
he dreamt he was taking a bus

to Syracuse/Siracusa

home he must never have shared
for you never gave me its songs

now in my 24th year

of dreams where you do not recognize me
where I scream at the gaze of your
glazed over eyes

I press my hands to the glass

and try to find our faces

in names too long foreign

in the dividing lines

of this strange hot island

I try to draw new eyes

that are our own

standing here alone

I wonder why they can never meet:
my skin and the surface

my heart and the words themselves.
