HARP: Holly Near, Arlo Guthrie,  
Ronnie Gilbert, Pete Seeger. 1985  
Redwood Records. $9.00  

If you can imagine an exciting  
evening with dear, old friends --  
one that warms the heart, stirs the  
emotions and makes you feel just  
plain great -- you have a grasp on  
the new Redwood release of a live  
concert performance of four old  
folkies, Near, Guthrie, Seeger and  
Gilbert.  

While all four had never performed  

together before last year, they had  
admired each other's work, and had  

performed together in various combin-  

ations of duets and trios. This  
album blends their tremendous  
artistic talents and political in-  
clinations into a wonderful gift  
for the ears and the sensibilities.  
The songs range from traditional  
to brand new and are unashamedly  
folk music. There's some gospel,  

Mary Don’t You Weep and Pallet on  

the Floor, old favorites like  
Wimoweh, City of New Orleans and  
Jacob's Ladder, a new upbeat  
Holly Near Good for the World,  
and a Near/Marvin Gaye medley,  
as well as a new Arlo Guthrie  
tune called All Over the World.  
For those who like folk music,  
and see its current revival as a  
positive sign both artistically and  
politically, this album combines  
just about everything you'd want to  
hear. Appreciators of genuine  
musical talent and the electricity  
of live concert albums, this is  
one to add to your collection.  
Guthrie's tune, All Over the  
World expresses succinctly the  
optimism and visionary quality  
of folk music this album carries:  
I was watching the news to-  
night/ And all over the world/  
People were singing and carrying  
signs/ All over the world/  
Everybody walking hand in hand  
through cities that I've been/  
And though I'm not there tonight  
you know/ I'll be back again,

LISTENING  

PRAIRIE FIRE, Cris Williamson. 1985  
Redwood Records. $9.00  

Cris Williamson's newest release  
reminds me of the first time I saw  
her in concert in Ithaca in 1975.  
There's a lot more energy than some  
of her other albums, and this one's  
solidly in the folk tradition.  

The title tune, Prairie Fire is  

a toned-down version of her concert  
performance 10 years ago, but has a  
nice spark to it and uses her  
signature melodic hook to good  
effect. Many of these are western-  
folk inspired tunes and the album  
is pleasantly diverse and easy to  
listen to. My favorite song,  
Suitcase Full of Sorrow is an  
old-fashioned love song a la Bill  
Staines, lovely, melodic and articu-  
late.  

Cris Williamson fans will like  
this one, and those who have not  
really appreciated some of her re-  
cent concerts or albums, should  
like Prairie Fire.  

ABORTION: STORIES FROM NORTH AND  
SOUTH  
Review by Jo Osborne  

"Abortion: Stories from North and  
South" is a very persuasive movie.  
By showing the actual conditions of  
people's lives, it manages to make  
a convincing case for legal abortion  
far more effectively than anti-  
choice demagoguery, lies and propa-  
ganda.  

The film begins in Ireland where  
abortion is officially illegal.  
Through the experiences of a young  
Irish woman, we discover that there  
is abortion referral and that many  
Irish women travel to England for  
safe and legal abortion. However,  
we suffer with the woman who is  
afraid she will be victimized by  
people who will find out about her  
abortion and let her employer know.  

There follows a short history of  
abortion which emphasizes that  
danger has never been a deterrent  
to women determined to obtain ab-  
ortions.  

The scene shifts to Peru where  
abortion is illegal. Peasant  
women are shown drinking an herbal  
potion guaranteed to “bring on the  

BIG PROMISE, Sue Fink 1985  

The composer of the infamous  
“Leapin' Lesbians" song is back,  
and outrageous as ever. Sue Fink,  
an accomplished singer/songwriter  
and electronic music composer  
offers a new album of danceable  
"technopop". The highly synthe-  
sized music sounds a lot like  
what people gyrate to in the bars  
every weekend, but the lyrics add  
a new twist. My personal favorite  
is "Boys Are Thugs," which when  
cranked up to top volume and  
shouted along with, is an effective  
therapeutic remedy to the anger  
brought on by street harassment.  

Also included are several more  
melodic, cabaret-type numbers which  
show off Fink's fine clear voice  
and command of melody and phrasing.  

This is a slick looking and  
well-produced album that crosses  
over smoothly into the mainstream  
of pop music. Its strongest  
point, I think, is its sense of  
humor.  

period" (we wonder at what cost).  
Many Peruvian women die from illeg-  
al abortions, and many women go to  
jail if their abortions are dis-  
covered. Often their children  
accompany them to prison since  
there is nowhere else for them to  
go. Other “solutions" include  
infanticide and neglect.  

In Thailand we learn that al-  
though abortion is illegal, no one  
is prosecuted for it. As if to  
lighten the somber mood created by  
the depiction of women's lot in  
other parts of the world, there is  
an amusing segment in which a work-  
er demonstrates the use of the con-  
dom in what appears to be an entire  
mountain village - men, women and  
children. They are all overcome  
with laughter at the pointed, yet  
humorous instructions. (One wishes  
that many such scenes could be  
duplicated here in the U.S.A.!)  

A brief look at Japan shows us  
that while abortion is available on  
a limited basis, male legislators  
are constantly lobbying to impose  
further restrictions. The Japan-  
ese have no tradition of families  
discussing sexuality, and there is  
no formal sexuality education  
available. With limited success,  
feminists are struggling to liber-  
alize the laws.  

The segment on Canada contrasts  
the availability of abortions in  
the province of Quebec with the
