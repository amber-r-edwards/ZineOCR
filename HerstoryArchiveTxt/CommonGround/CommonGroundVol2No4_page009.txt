The Winged Dancer:
Mystery With Unusual Depth

THE WINGED DANCER, by Camarin Grae  
($6.95 softcover), does much more than  
tell an interesting, fast-moving story,  
though, indeed, it does that.  
The time is now.  
a fictitious country in South America.  
The hero is Kat Rogan, a 33-year-old,  
educated, assertive lesbian who witnesses  
a murder and is lured away from  
her stable life in Chicago to a series  
of adventures across the continent.  
The novel is unique in a number of  
ways: its main characters are lesbians  
but THE WINGED DANCER is neither an  
apology nor an exploitation of les-  
bianism. It is a murder mystery, yet  
also a psychological exploration of  
power in which the characters are de-  
veloped with a depth unusual for this  

genre.  
Soon after her arrival in South  
America, Kat Rogan is sent to prison  

where she manifests the previously  
unacknowledged "macho male" side of  
her personality. Later, at a semi-  
utopic prison estate, she gets in  
touch with the opposite, "traditionally  
feminine” role of her character.  
By experiencing and probing this di-  
chotomy within herself, Kat Rogan  
struggles to break free from it. At  
the same time, she struggles to free  
herself from her unjust imprisonment  
by solving the murder - she pursues  
the killer and he pursues her. The  
“winged dancer” of the title haunts  
the pages as a symbol of the struggle  
of right over might, of freedom and  
fairness over oppression.  

Author Grae clearly knows well the  
complexities of human psychology and  
the social sex-role pressures to which  
everyone is subjected. She has suc-  
ceeded in weaving this awareness into  
an exciting, provocative, and well-  
written adventure story that will sure-  
ly appeal to lesbians and to feminists.  
It also, no doubt, will intrigue mys-  
tery buffs, the psychologically-minded  
and anyone who likes a gripping plot  
interestingly peopled.  

THE WINGED DANCER is the first of-  
fering of a new women's publishing  
company, Blazon Books, in which Grae  
is an owner. The book is available  
at bookstores or directly from the  
publisher at 1934 W. Belle Plain,  
Chicago, IL 60613.

Kay Gardner is a creative and  
improvisational composer/performer  
who has gained tremendous respect  
and recognition since the early  
'70s. She has written over two  

dozen songs, three works for or-  
chestra, concert band music, choral  
compositions, chamber works, film  
scores, a musical and an opera.  

Mooncircles, released in 1975,  
was the first of Gardner's solo  

albums. She appeared earlier on  
Lavender Jane Loves Women, one of  
the ground-breaking efforts of the  
then-emerging “women's music net-  
work”. In 1978 she was co-founder  
of the New England Women's Sym-  
phony, which is comprised of both  
women and men, devoted to the per-  
formance of women's orchestral  
music, and conducted by women.  

In recent years Gardner has be-  
come a significant force in the  
developing field of music therapy.  
She is at the forefront of the  
current trends toward lyrical,  
improvisational and experimental  
music designed for meditation, re-  
laxation and healing. Her latest  
LP, The Rainbow Path, was con-  
ceived as a guide for the use of  
music and color meditation in heal-  
ing.  

While in Buffalo, Kay Gardner  
will present her “Healing Music"  
workshop, which introduces the  
Pythagorean and Hindu concepts  

of healing, and examines the healing  

potential of vibrations, vowels,  
repetition, musical intervals,  
scales, modes and ragas as they  
relate to physical and emotional  
factors.  

This will be held on Tuesday  
December 6, 7 pm, sponsored by  
EMMA the Buffalo Women's Bookstore.  
It will take place at Buffalo State  
College, 1300 Elmwood Avenue,  
in room 116 East, Bacon Hall.  
Admission is $10.
