Towards the Future

Swinging On A Star In Israel

Israel is Real  
Seven Civilizations

Heaven and Hell  
Distilled

— Joyce Anthony Caldwell

Wild Stallions

Star gazers —

ladies of the passionate night,  
the cloudless evening

lays purple before

your touch.

Forever casting

spells of melody gone mad  
revolting against your

nursery, rhymes and  
childhood fantasies.

Lay still now -

and dream your dreams,  
spin your web of

many todays strung  
like bubbles awaiting the touch.

— Louise Genetti

Spring Tide

what will I do with it  
if you don't want it  
won't take it?

it laughs and sparkles

it tickles and itches

it runs along the ground  
and blossoms follow it  
apple and cherry and peach  
warm flakes of snow, and  
cool tongues of flame

long streamers flaring  
Teas

it fills and fills  
burgeoning  
the fullness of it

— Bonnie Johnson

Potential

Tonight we gather to celebrate OUR holiday  
grinning at pumpkins  
spreading like bats  
hissing catlike  
howling...  
while undercurrents of our common origin surface  
in rapids of restless strength  
whirlpools of power.

Which of us does not glance speculatively at a broom and  
feel her weight lighten  
or  
gaze full-faced at the moon in communion?
