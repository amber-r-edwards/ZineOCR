“Childcare Provided”  

by Sharon Przepasniak  

A few years ago, when I first be-  
came aware of events in Buffalo's  
feminist community, I was pleasantly  
surprised to read "Childcare Provided"  
on the posters and flyers of quite a  
few events. Frustrated that my first  
child, then a toddler, had so com-  
pletely curtailed my former activi-  
ties, it wasn't long before I attended  
one such event.  

It was a poetry reading, and I'll  
never forget it - the experience, not  
the poems, I'm sorry to say. It was  
held at U.B.'s Women's Studies College  
located in a structure that was orig-  
inally a house. Consequently, the  
room used for childcare was directly  
upstairs from those reading poetry,  
and in earshot of the audience. And  
as for me, well, my son was still too  
afraid to be left with total strangers  
and so I could hardly concentrate on  
the poetry as I stood near the stair-  
way listening for him!  

That particular night, there were  
six or seven children of various ages and  
two babies. Although several "child-  
care workers" (a title, by the way  
which sounds so regimental and in-  
dustrial) were doing a good job of  
keeping them all occupied and reason-  
ably quiet, the bedroom-sized room  
appeared a bit chaotic, to say nothing  
of crowded. Yet in spite of the  
spare accommodations, those volunteers  
displayed an impressive amount of  
energy and concern.  

Since then, I have attended per-  
haps a half-dozen other functions at  
which childcare was provided. All of  
them had some connection either  
directly to the feminist community,  
or to organizations composed predom-  
inantly of women with small children.  
Furthermore, all of the childcare  
was provided free of charge, although  
a container for donations was usually  
the rule. Yet I have observed a very  
broad range (from wonderful to dis-  
astrous) of facilities, toys, sup-  
plies, safety features and super-  
vision. Consequently, at some I  
have felt very comfortable leaving  
my child for an hour or two, while  
at others, I have only stopped long  
enough to look around the room or  
change a diaper.  

Once I was unable to leave my  
climbing and crawling baby be-  

cause only part of the floor was  
covered with a rug, and so there  
was a good chance she might hit her  
head on the floor. Another time I  
forfeited a film that I had long  
wanted to see in order to remain in  
an overcrowded and understaffed  
playroom with my 3-year-old, for  
fear that she might venture out the  
open door, unnoticed. And recently,  
during another film, there were so  
few toys to occupy the kids that one  
childcare worker finally resorted to  
giving them candy to keep them quiet.  
So although the opportunity to see  
films or hear speakers is very tempt-  
ing, I often hesitate to take ad-  
vantage of the free childcare. And  
although often I can leave my child-  
ren home with my husband, this is  
not an alternative for some women.  
Another issue to be considered  
is time; many of these events take  
place in the evening. A function  
that doesn't begin until 7:30 or 8:00  
pm hardly lends itself to those  
women whose babies are on early  
schedules or whose children have to  
get up for school the next morning.  
Also, many of the very women who  
would both enjoy and benefit from  
some of these films and speakers do  
not even have transportation for  
themselves and their children; thus  
taking advantage of such childcare is  
not even an option for many women.  

I've also observed some feminist  
women whose overzealousness can al-  
most have the opposite effect. Re-  
cently I - and the baby - attended a  
day of workshops, information and  
speakers to celebrate International  
Women's Day. As I entered McKinley  
High School and approached the main  
room of exhibits, a woman who was  
posted to direct people and answer  
questions immediately looked down  
at the stroller and said, "I know  
what you want! Childcare is up-  
stairs."  

Although her intentions were no  
doubt caring and sincere, my gut  
impulse was to wheel that stroller  
right around and leave. I think it  
is inaccurate and inappropriate to  
assume that all parents want to get  
rid of their children the minute they  
arrive. Don't get me wrong; pro-  
viding free childcare at such events  
is a wonderful - and far too in-  
frequent - service. But it is also  
important for organizers of such  
functions not to come on too strong,  
especially when approaching mothers  
who might not necessarily be fem-  
inists; this could only sour them on  
becoming more involved in future  
events. And it is necessary to  
remember that not all parents want  
to leave their kids, that some par-  
ents will only leave their children  
for part of the time, and that some  
kids will only be comfortable being  
separated from their parents for  
short periods of time.  

Perhaps the gap between women who  
are mothers and those who are not is  
just too wide. Since I have been  
both of these people, I am attuned  
to how things appear "from both sides  
of the fence.” In an attempt to un-  
derstand the problems and limitations  
of mothers, as well as the politics  
of a society that does not adequately  
accommodate women with children,  
some feminists become so eager to  
help that they can overwhelm or even  
turn women off. They may not always  
be aware that not all mothers feel  
comfortable leaving their children,  
for whatever reasons.  

Later at the IWD gathering, I was  
talking with several people when a  
woman arrived with a child that looked  
to be about 3 years old. After a  
moment of greetings, she announced,  
"Well, I'm going to take her upstairs  
and dump her in the childcare room!"  
My arms ached to rush over and hug  
that child, and it was hard for me  
to not interfere in the lives of  
people I hardly know. But what a  
cruel, callous way to state her in-  
tentions; a three-year-old can  
surely understand, if not the exact  
language, its connotations as well  
as the way things are said.  

So whenever I learn of an event  
with childcare provided that I'd  
love to attend, I often hesitate.  

I have to weigh so many factors  

(will the facility be safe for  

both babies and children of all ages,  
will they all be carefully super-  
vised, will there be enough construct-  
ive activities and safe toys, how  
much will I have to juggle nap and  
meal schedules that day, how late  
will we get home, how much will I  
have to pack) against my own needs  
and desires.  

Yet at the same time, I am always  
touched that someone understands how  
being a mother so drastically changes  
a woman's life, and that someone  
tries to make provisions for such  
women. All the overcrowded and un-  
derstaffed childcare situations that  
I've seen have proved to me that  
there certainly is a demand for such  
a service. Many women are out there  
who need and want not only to get  
out of the house and get a brief re-  
spite from their kids, but also to be  
intellectually stimulated.  

So to all those in the feminist  
community who organize and "do"  
childcare, I commend and thank you  
for recognizing women's needs. At  
the same time, let us all be aware of  
the need for improvements in these  
childcare situations. And finally,  
may I suggest that we call it some-  
thing less cold? After all, can we  
really criticize the father who tells  
his friends that he has to "babysit"  
while his wife is out, when we tell  
them that we are going to do child-  
care?  

As mentioned in the January issue,  
this column has taken the place of  
"Community Speakout." After the  
birth of my second child, I found it  
increasingly difficult to do the  
necessary interviewing which that  
column required. Hopefully, at some  
point in the future, "Community  
Speakout" will be resurrected to  
again give women an opportunity  
to voice their opinions.  

Potpourri, according to the  
American Heritage Dictionary of the  
English Language, is "a combination  
of various incongruous elements."  
Because I am writing on a variety  
of topics, based on my own obser-  
vations and contemplations, that  
affect women in some way, this word  
seemed to be an appropriate label.  
Its other definition is "a mixture  
of dried flower petals and spices  
kept in a jar and used to scent the  
air." Flower petals remind me of  
women's beauty, while the spices  
suggest cooking, an area of work in  
which women have for so long found  
an outlet for their many talents,  
their creativity and their energy.
