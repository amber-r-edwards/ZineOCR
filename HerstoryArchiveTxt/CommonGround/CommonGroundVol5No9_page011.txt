Celibacy. I used to think only  
nuns and spinsters suffered from  
this affliction. And it only  
happened to women; I never con-  
sidered the possibility of a  
celibate man.

Celibacy certainly always  
sounded negative to me, like some-  
thing you'd give up for Lent,  
except that it lasted much longer.  
Because in our society we are  
bombarded with sexual images,  
it is easy to feel that something  
is wrong if we are not sexually  
active.

However, because of the writings  
of feminists as well as experiences  
in my own life, I've slowly come  
to realize that abstaining from  
sex, whether by choice or by de-  
fault, isn't the end of the world.  
In fact, it's even o.k.

Daphne’s

by Sarah Slavin  
DITTANY OF BUFFALO

Here is an odd ode to the  
Prunella vulgaris, otherwise  
known as self-heal. This ode is  
more irregular than most and  
surely not what Sappho had in  
mind. But, let us begin with  
self-heal, a regular arrangement  
of two words if ever there was  
one. This little plant looks  
almost but not quite like a  
dittany of Crete (Origanum dictam-  
nus). Daphne knew just by looking  
that here was a close cousin of  
wild marjoram even more than its  
cousin, dittany of Crete.

Imagine though, Daphne's thrill  
at having found a dittany of Buf-  
falo! For the skeptical, the word  
'Buffalo' is of Native American  
origin: Compare the Latin 'Origan-  
um,' which gets no more out of  
four syllables than we Buffaloans  
get from three. Buf-fa-lo means  
where-the-sky-and-waters-meet.

Even with the Mediterranean close  
at hand, dittany of Crete has no  
better to offer--unless the goat  
of Crete is to be regarded the  
buffalo of Buffalo's superior,  
which does not sound very democra-  
tic. Daphne thinks the dittany  
of Buffalo has as much going where  
the sky and waters meet as the  
dittany of Crete has with its  
goats.

But, getting on with things,  
on a slightly overcast Sunday  
afternoon early one July, Daphne  
and Karen and Daphne's son Hale  
set out for North Tonawanda and  
a gallery show of Jo Anne Brenner's  
terra-cotta medallions. We soon  
discovered that we had left be-  
hind Hale's letterboard. Hale  
uses this device, sign language  
and a portable Epson computer with  
a synthesized voice for communica-  
tion, because he can no longer  
speak without them. On October  
2, 1983, a drunk driver struck  
Hale, who was comatose for nearly  
five months after; Hale is labor-  
ing to relearn the functions of  
which he was wrongfully deprived.  
This particular Sunday Karen went  
back into the treehouse for the  
letterboard...and Daphne spied  
in the grasses, among the white,  
clover (Trifolium repens), the  
dittany of Buffalo.

In fact, the grasses and white  
clover were thick with dittany of  
Buffalo; and Daphne thought to pick  
a sprig for Hale's buttonhole. A  
boutonniere of dittany of Buffalo!  
Daphne was on her knees among the  
grasses picking a dittany of Buffalo  
for Hale's buttonhole, and a sweet  
self-heal it was. The leaves on  
the creeping stem were in seven  
pairs and diminutively mint-like.  
(Mentha, Prunella and Origanum are  
blood kin.) So beautiful was  
self-heal's flowerhead rising  
above a collar of leaves that  
Daphne could see why it sometimes  
also is called heart of the earth.  
The flowers of heart of the earth  
grow in whorls about an ear, six  
flowers to a whorl. This partic-  
ular specimen had four whorls.

It was young, only two and one/  
half inches long above ground.  
From a distance, the young self-  
heal might be mistaken for a  
late flowering red clover (Tri-  
folium pratense perenne) that  
had flowered and past its prime.  
A full grown self-heal plant of  
three to twelve inches would  
have anywhere from six to twelve  
whorls of flowers. Showing them-  
selves to their best advantage,  
they do not open all at once.  
Hale smiled his special smile  
at his sprig of Prunella vulgaris,  
nee self-heal, nee dittany of  
Buffalo, nee heart of the earth.  
Daphne smiled, too: Karen and  
Daphne each must have her own  
sprig.

With the letterboard, Karen  
returned to Hale's smile and  
Daphne's knee in the grasses  
of white clover. Soon Karen  
had in hand a square-stemmed  
sprig of dittany of Buffalo;  
and Daphne was threading her  
own sprig into a buttonhole of  
her blue striped jacket.

Appropos of nothing, dittany  
of Buffalo is also known as  
blue curls.

Daphne's readers need not  
stand in awe, if they do, of  
all these names. The more names  
an herb compiles, the longer the  
herb has been around. A paucity  
of names means something compara-  
tively new. Around Daphne's tree  
we are often into the ancient.

For example, the first evidence  
of dittany of Crete dates back  
to 1500 B.C. and a frieze on  
Crete near Knossos.

Getting on with things herself,  
as she is wont to do, Karen com-  
mented on the strong smell of  
self-heal. Oh, the wild marjorams  
often do smell strong, Daphne  
explained even as a sniff and the  
look in Hale's eyes told her this  
was a very strong-smelling wild  
Prunella. Some of the wild mints  
are rumored to smell foul...  
Daphne rummaged through more of  
Prunella's names for a clue:  
all-heal, hook-heal, slough-heal.  
Not one for scholasticism, Karen  
wondered if a dog had wandered  
through the grass. Alas! The  
heel of Daphne's good brogue had  
come to no good. Karen muttered  
that sometimes Daphne carried  
the Daphne thing too far. Kneel-  
ing on the curb, wishing the dog  
had been curbed instead, Daphne  
scraped with a leafless twig at  
her heel until it seemed wisest  
to change her shoes. As Daphne  
passed, scuffing the hard fescue,  
dog-grass and crested dogstail*  
in futile protest, Karen and Hale  
giggled wildly. Daphne's neighbor  
yelled for all to hear that Daphne's  
knee needed attention, too. Heart  
of the earth, indeed! Slough heal is  
more like it! By chips at least  
are dried. This is not what Alice  
Walker meant when she wrote "I think  
it pisses God off if you walk by the  
color purple in a field and don't no-  
tice it."

*Festuca duriuscula, Agropyron  
repens and Cynosurus cristatus.  
Although in common parlance, the  
word 'suffaloon' may have been  
coined by Karen Lynn Peterson.  
Word gets around.

For me, my longest period of  
celibacy began with lots of re-  
sentment, since I had no control  
over the decision. Initially, I  
felt like it was a secret I should  
hide. I felt quite different  
from most of my friends and ac-  
quaintances.

Like anything else, however,  
one eventually adjusts to change.  
After a while, I not only got used  
to celibacy, I even began to enjoy  
some aspects of it. For instance,

NEW HOPE FOR HOPEVALE

The 98 troubled young women of  
Hopevale recently received good news  
when the Sisters of Our Lady of Cha-  
rity announced that they will be  
seeking a State license to continue  
the program. Until the announcement,  
the Home was expected to close by  
July 1, displacing the girls and  
terminating employment for 200 full  
and part-time employees.

Sister Patrick Stapleton, Su-  
perior General of the North Ameri-  
can Union of the Sisters of Our Lady  
of Charity, announced in a prepared  
statement that her order has decided  
“We are willing and able to run a  
new program at Hopevale." Steven  
Light, one of 7 Hopevale employees  
laid off last week, read the state-  
ment to about 75 present and former  
employees of Hopevale in a meeting  
held at Hamburg Town Hall. It is  
understood that Sister Stapleton and  
the Sisters would run the same type  
of program and hire existing staff,  
with some changes at the upper level.  
The Sisters are hoping for licensing  
by July 1 to prevent any hiatus.

Sister Stapleton's statement said:  
"The Sisters are putting together an  
application for a license to run a  
program here. Among the important  
factors considered in coming to this  
decision were a recognition of the  
need for these services for these  
girls, the urging and willingness of  
the majority of staff members to work  
with the Sisters and our intention to  
keep jobs in this area. We hope and  
pray that all interested parties sup-  
port the Sisters in our endeavors."

The present Board of Directors of  
Hopevale voted in early April to phase  
out operation of the Home by July 1 to  
comply with an Erie County Court evic-  
tion order. The order was obtained by  
the Sisters, owners of the Hopevale  
facilities, because Hopevale, Inc. had  
fallen behind over $60,000 in monthly  
rental payments. The Directors' action  
would have resulted in cessation of op-  
erations for both the Home and the  
Hopevale Union Free School District  
which operates the high school serving  
the young women.

The following poems were  
submitted to Common Ground by  
residents of Hopevale:

My Mother

My mother is so wonderful  
She has always been there  
for me

But I guess I just didn't realize  
it. Now I'm older and can  
care for myself

She tells me she'll always  
be there

But she's real sick now  
and I don't know how much  
longer she'll be there

so I guess what I'm trying  
to say is

Take the time to love your  
mother while she's there  
Don't wait until she's  
gone,

Because then it's too late

PMS

Women suffering from PMS (pre-  
menstrual syndrome) may be able  
to participate in a U.B. study.  
If you are between 21 and 40  
years old, are not pregnant or  
taking birth control pills, and  
experience moderate to severe  
PMS, call Cherie R. Weiss at  
691-8960 for more information.

PELVIC INFLAMMATORY DISEASE

Nearly 1 million women get  
the disease known as pelvic in-  
flammatory disease (PID), a debil-  
itating, painful disease which  
can lead to infertility. Symptoms  
include mild to moderate abdominal  
pain, vaginal discharge, burning  
on urination or painful intercourse.  
Multiple sex partners is the sin-  
gle most important factor putting  
women at risk. Women who detect  
any abnormal symptoms should check  
with their health care provider.

CERVICAL CANCER

Cervical cancer may be a sexu-  
ally transmitted disease, caused  
by an as-yet undiscovered virus,  
according to the American Journal  
of Epidemiology. Men who have  
had multiple sex partners, it is  
theorized, are more likely to  
transmit the disease. Other fac-  
tors which put women at risk for  
cervical cancer are the number of  
sex partners the woman has and  
beginning sexual intercourse at  
a young age.

Magic

I can see

Beyond this world

Where no one has ever been  
before

It's a little place called  
Magic

When I'm there

All my troubles seem to  
fade away

I can touch the highest  
star

And I don't even have to  
stand on my toes  
squeeze the clouds  
as if they were a joint piece  
of cotton  
wear no shirt  
wear no shoes  
pin my hair up with  
a golden twig  
wear no socks so my  
toes are loose  
I can fly so high by just  
closing my eyes

I love this little place called  
Magic so

How I want to stay

But when it's time to go  
I'll have to

Put back on my  
socks, shirt, and shoes

Stretch my arms and yawn  
for I awake  
to the same place

I was before I drifted off  
to that little place called  
Magic.

Wow!

In the night I'm going to dance.  
Far, far away I'm going to prance.

I'm a free spirit, I'll make you listen

I'll make you hear it!

So come on people,

Let's make some commotion,  
Being radical-

It's my devotion.

It's So Peaceful

It's so peaceful

to just stand in a window

and watch all of the people walk by.  
Some smiling

Some frowning

Some just walking.

Little whispers

A lot of laughter

Some people point at me

Others just frown and scuff their feet.

I wish I could be  
One of those people  
Peeking in at me.
