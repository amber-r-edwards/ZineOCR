Balancing on the Spiral

by Silversmith

The wheel of the year keeps a-
turning and in March we mark another
of the Sabbats, the Vernal or Spring
Equinox. The date varies between
March 20 and 23, occurring this year
on the 20th. Equinox -- equal --
balance -- the day of equal light and
darkness. Commonly we accept the
Equinox as the first day of spring.

From earliest times the changes
in daylight/darkness have been ob-
served and the Equinoxes and Solstic-
es recognized as key points on the
calendar. Romans celebrated a fest-
ival of Atonement close to the Spring
Equinox. As part of their rituals
they bathed in ashes which were be-
lieved in both Rome and India to ab-
solve sin. Persians, until well into
the 18th century, celebrated the
Spring Equinox as the Solar New
Year. Celebrants presented each

other with colored, usually red, eggs.
The egg of course, is a symbol of re-
birth and, to the Persians, red sym-
bolized life and rebirth.*

While Witches and Pagans celebrate
the equinox as a major Sabbat, and
as followers of the Old, Earth, Re-
ligions are close to the seasonal
changes and cycles of birth, growth,
flowering, harvest, decay and re-
birth, another aspect of the Equinox
may be of particular importance to
wimmin of the Goddess. Balance.
The Goddess is often depicted as em-
bodying both the forces of creation
and destruction, of light and dark.
She is the ultimate understanding of
dynamic balance. This is not the
static, stagnant, balance of patriar-
chy; not the "balance of power" over
which brings us to lives of fear and
immobility! The balance which Witches
seek is that which permits a full
life in harmony with the environment
and all life forms. Our work may be
overtly political in Peace Encampments
organizations devoted to the environ-
ment, wildlife, human rights etc.
It is balanced with meditation, chant,

What single working mother hasn't
wrestled her anger and guilt over a
child coming home to an empty house
after school? Even with adequate pre-
paration and safeguards, situations
come up which a parent cannot anticipate
and children might not be able to han-
dle on their own. Working mothers are
caught in grinding frustration between
the high cost of day-care facilities,
and psychologists who warn that we are
forcing our “latch-key" children to
grow up too fast.

For West Side working parents, how-
ever, there is an alternative. The
Children’s Afterschool Program (CAP)
provides a program geared to single
working parents or two-parent working
families. Children ages 6 to 12 are
supervised by a site director, an aide,
and volunteers who are college students
or retired persons. The activities
available include recreational games,
quiet games, arts & crafts, special
projects, and time set aside for home-
work. Inexpensive field trips are also
planned to local parks, the zoo, or
the circus. Swimming, miniature golf,
and roller skating are offered once
a month.
a weekend camping trip at the end of
the year.

Even with the variety of activities,
an attractive feature of CAP is the
cost, $6.00 a week per child for the
five-day, 2:30 through 5:30 p.m. pro-
gram. That's about 40¢ per hour for
childcare. Parents pay only one-third
the total cost for the program. The
remainder is funded by the Concerned
Ecumenical Ministry (CEM) through
church funding, the United Way, and

local grants.

CEM is an upper West Side coa-
lition of seventeen churches repre-
senting nine denominations, formed to
promote their philosophy of “people
helping people". The CAP program
was started two years ago when the
need for a low-cost after-school care
became evident in the community. The
original group (CAP I) still meets at
the Lutheran Church of the Redeemer
at 656 Elmwood Avenue. A second site
(CAP II) was developed last year at
the First Methodist Church at Baynes
and Potomac. An added benefit to
parents of the program is a single-
parent support group discussing

such topics as guilt, anger, loneliness,

and discipline. These groups enable
parents to share their feelings and
to cope more successfully with family
problems.

If you live on the West Side and
are interested in one of the CAP
programs, or in volunteering some
time, contact VICKY at 882-2442.
Currently, openings are available at
the CAP II First Methodist Church
site.

community must be in harmony to achieve
the best result in either.

We must work to balance our ap-

proach to the craft itself. Some
Witches and wimmin coming to the Craft
rely entirely on what is written -

or otherwise communicated - by our
more visible spokeswimmin. Others
reject all “book learning" in favor

of total self-expression. For bal-
ance, I would recommend both approach-
es which can co-exist harmoniously in
our lives. Both can direct our ritu-
als and our work.

Perhaps the most difficult balance
for wimmin is personal. How do we
balance our rage and our love? Our
dependencies and strengths?
myriad other personal issues in all
our lives? Can we confront the dark
and the light in ourselves? Like the
seed, we began in darkness, sprouted
into light. How often we forget the
roots which continue to grow in the
dark places - without which we can-
not exist - and appreciate the flowers
in the sun.

The Equinox is an excellent time
for us to address these issues in our
selves, to identify what we need to
bring balance and to begin the work.
Because this is such a highly per-
sonal effort, there is no single,
simple answer for every womyn. There
may be a couple of guidelines though:

Take care in identifying problems
and solutions. For example, as we
attempt to balance our need for food
with respect for other life forms,
the importance of the answer may not
be in WHAT we eat, i.e., vegetarian vs
meat eating, but in whether we respect

the life form -- be it cow, chicken,
or carrot -- whose death sustains our
life.

Work with the elemental forces.
It would be equally foolish to attempt
swimming against the current in the
Niagara rapids as it would be to
choose to go over the Falls in a bar-
rel. The basic, elemental power of
water which is evident in the rapids
and falls provides an excellent op-
portunity for meditation and balance.
Go to the rapids or falls. Feel the
power of raging water. Draw that
power into yourself. Feel it. Feel
yourself become one with the power
of water. Balance it. You are
nourishing rain. You are a single

drop glistening in the sun creating
a rainbow of colors.

See what I mean?
