CALDICOTT...

On November 18 and 19, thousands  
of women from all over New England  
and across the United States will  
gather in New York City to resist the  
economic, physical and emotional vio-  
lence against women; organizers have  
called this action "Not In Our Names"  
to specifically resist acts supposedly  
done “for the women's own good". Women  
will protest the connections between  
multinational corporate money and  
"macho" violence against women at home  
and in the Third World.

On Sunday, women will march to three  
corporate sites to give testimonies  
from their own experience and exper-  
iences of their absent sisters: stories  
of the increasing numbers of rapes in  
the streets, battering and starvation  
in the home; of economic violence in  
the job market and in the South African  
apartheid; and of military violence in  
Central America. Women will also tes-  
tify at three sites of resistance,  
recognizing the strength and creativity  
of the long history of women's resis-  
tance.

The march and testimonials will be  
punctuated not just by the similarity  
of the women's oppression; colorful  
banners, theatre and songs will demar-  
cate their different oppressions:  
racism, classism, homophobia, ableism  
and others. Links will be made between  
these oppressive forces, such as  
those that force sterilization on  
women of color and that build an  
arsenal of nuclear weapons with  
which to sterilize the entire planet.

On Monday, creative acts of civil  
disobedience will disrupt and resist  
“business as usual" on Wall Street,  
the center of economic world power.  
There, organizers explain, rich white  
men get richer “in the name of pros-  
perity for all and a strong America",  
while women and children of many colors  
starve and are killed around the  
world without even a record of their  
struggles.

The organizers of the action are  
spread throughout New England with  
groups in Vermont, Washington, Western  
Massachusetts, upstate New York and  
Hartford; the regional offices are  
at 339 Lafayette Street in New York  
(212) 254-4961 and at 15 Newbury  
Street in Boston (617) 247-0470 and  
at 160 Main Street in Northampton,  
MA. *

REVIEW by Lois Van Houten

It is so good, in these poems,  
to find someone writing from a high  
lookout, from joy, good health, from  
companionship.

The youth, vibrance, vitality in  
this small volume, makes us feel we  
have grown old and the world with us.  
Here, there is a spirit of camaraderie,  
a 'come on follow me’ ...we'll  
learn about life and love and we'll  
have fun!

Anyone who has ever heard and seen  
the wind in the trees on a soft April  
evening will appreciate the sensuality  
in the poem ‘the wind'...and the pathos  
of ‘elegy’ in which the dead cat  
is given a certain dignity in naming  
it 'A Most Interesting Phenomenon'.

The poems in this small book make  
for a most exotic mix of moths, souvlaki,  
Christmas trees, Chinese silk,  
film dreams, electric moans and most  
of all, as it affirms in the poem  
"the wind":

‘oh yes oh yes oh yes'

scientific, esoteric, and intellectual  
pursuits, combined with a clinical  
paranoia about the Russians, and  
rapacious greed exhibited by the mili-  
tary industries." This lust, fascin-  
ation, paranoia and greed has resulted  
in such weapons as the MX, the  
Trident II, the Cruise Missile, and  
the Pershing II. Her description  

of these weapons was especially valu-  
able for me. Though I have been ac-  
tive in the peace movement for over  

a year, I am somewhat ashamed to ad-  
mit that I still couldn't really say,  
if pressed, why a Cruise missile was  
bad. That it was bad, I knew. Now  
I know that it is bad because not  
only is each missile twenty times  
larger than the bomb that fell on  
Hiroshima, but that it is small and  
flies close to the ground, beneath  
radar. Most important, its invulner-  
ability to detection makes arms con-  
trol virtually obsolete. 464 are  
being presently deployed in Europe.  
The Pershing II is a rapid intercon-  
tinental missile that can reach Moscow  
within 6-10 minutes of launching.  
This means that there will be no time  
for human input, and computers could  
very well launch an all-out nuclear  
war. Both the Cruise and Pershing II  
are first-strike weapons. They are  
offensive and not defensive, and in-  
dicate that, contrary to what the U.S.  
government says, it is preparing to  
initiate a nuclear war.

In the years from 1984 to 1988,  
the Reagan Administration plans to  
spend from 1.8 to 2.5 trillion dollars  
on defense. (America has spent 1.5  
trillion dollars on defense in the  
last 37 years.) It is the Iron Tri-  
angle that determines these expendi-  
tures: the defense agencies such as  
the Pentagon, the key Congressional  
Committees, and private industries.  
It is, Caldicott maintains, a system  
of socialism for the rich and capital-  
ism for the poor.

And the one who suffers the most  
is, and will be, nature. Nuclear  
bombs are being tested continually  
in the Nevada Desert at the dry Yucca  
Lake site seventy miles north of Las  
Vegas. About every three weeks a  
bomb is lowered into a hole ten feet  
wide and one mile deep, and exploded  
in the earth. As of September 1982,  
380 underground tests had been con-  
ducted. The Administration no longer  
announces such tests.

We are in fact, especially given  
our production of first-strike weapons,  
preparing for nuclear war. And "the  
logical consequence of the preparation  
for nuclear war," Caldicott writes,  
“is nuclear war." In "The Terminal  
Event" she describes the effects of  
nuclear war (describing, as well,  
the Administration's ludicrous evac-  
uation plans) and ends with a descrip-  
tion of the Nuclear Winter, which  
would occur after a major nuclear  
exchange. Because of dense smoke  
clouds, the Northern Hemisphere could  
be plunged into sub-freezing dark  
conditions, and the earth's biologi-  
cal support system could well be  
destroyed. :

As I was writing this section of  
the review, a friend came to visit.  
She lives down the block and came  
to spend some time with me and my  
friend, because she was “bored out  
of her skull," sitting home with  
her two small boys.

this comment enough tim  
understand that it is a shared res-  
ponse. It is usually followed by a  
laugh. A cynical laugh, slightly  
stunned, as though the individual  
is surprised at the laugh and is try-  
ing to be comfortable with it.

These comments, those attitudes,  
that laughter, are examples of psychic  
numbing. I know psychic numbing  
well: I practiced it (or was under  
its effects) for years before I  
joined WAND, Women's Action for Nu-  
clear Disarmament. "The hell with  
it," I'd say, “it's going to happen  
anyway, there's nothing I can do to  
prevent it." But I thought about it  
all the same.

The fact that the general public  
pretends not to think about the very  
real possibility of the end of life  
on earth, Caldicott says, is tanta-  
mount to practicing passive suicide.  
And this repression of fear takes  
more mental energy than accepting the  
grief. It is only if we experience  

that grief and contemplate the reali-  

ty of nuclear war, can we be moved  

especially to  

to take action. She

we all live in Hiroshima. What will

and go on about your life? Or will  
you move? If the earth is Hiroshima,  
there is no place to move--except

MATERIAL

Common Ground has applied for an  
Arts Development Service grant to  
produce a special Arts Issue of Common  
Ground in March of 1985. The ADS grant  
will enable us to give a small honorarium  
for submissions we accept for  
publication in that one issue, and to  
produce a performance night of selec-  
ted authors/artists whose work we  
publish, to be held in mid-April, 1985.  
A panel of local writers and artists  
will help select the material and  
performers.

WomanExpress will be the name of this  
March 1985 issue of the newsjournal.  
We are calling for material from Erie  
County that captures the essence of  
women's various perspectives. We are  
looking for material that actively  
expresses women's participation in  
the world.

Deadline for submissions is December  
31, 1984. We are looking for original  
essays, short stories, excerpts from  
longer works, fiction, humor, poetry,  
arts criticism (dance, music, visual  
art, performance art, reviews), musical  
lyrics, black and white photographs,  
dramatic works, graphics (high contrast  
black and white) never previously  
published.

We will also consider a prospectus  
for an article on an arts event/review  
which would be impossible to complete  
due to the earliness of our deadline.

We are also looking for artwork for  
the cover of the issue which best  
conveys the theme of the issue.

Material not selected for this  
special issue may be held for publi-  
cation in another issue under our  
regular selections/submissions policy.

In addition we will select several  
authors/artists to be invited to read/
