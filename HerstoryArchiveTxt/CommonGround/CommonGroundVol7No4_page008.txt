The Yearning of One

My leaves won't be raked today.

The drone of an icy downpour flattens and freezes

my desire to move.  
And gusts of merciless wind lash and burn  
every revealed corner of my mind.

If only I could touch your exquisite skin  
and smell your myriad, exotic scents,

I would burst free, soar starward, and  
cascade a thousand faceted lights.

First Ride

a composite a melding  
a unison of foot on pedal

turn and follow through  

that unites ‘rider and machine

nerve endings raw  
with frigid sensitivity.  

I cry and feel.

of her riding machine:  
bipedal girl child  

her feet on silver pedals  

she careens between rectangles of lawns  
and trunks of trees  

down the sidewalk  

round going round  
turning round and round now  
the landscape

rider and machine finally one  

But all I see  

mirrored in their eyes  

are empty Stepford  
gazes.

Friend  

some days I am me  

& some days I am you  

a hide and seek with changing skins  
waking pressed to your imaginary face  

kicking hailstones down the street with your name  

the aching tease of our similarities  
creating the warm wake left by your absence  
disappearing into you as I rediscover myself  
my winsome twin, my aging child  

we are each other in the snow  

ablutions, comforts  

telling stories  

we needn't be the same  

to be alike  

to be the same —  

our pasts need not be married  

to give birth  

friendship isn't wedlock  

and we're free

Snail Haiku I  

Snail, you dream away  
winter, sealed happy in your  
hermaphrodite self.

Snail Haiku II  

Queer little gentle-  

man she drinks the slight mist of  

a snail's autumn night.  

— Charlotte Churchill  

from Protestant to Catholic.  
In those days,  

it was proper  

to have the same religion  
as your husband.  

Her psychiatrist prescribed it  
along with tranquilizers  
and shock treatment  

to bring sanctity and union  
to the marriage.  

He didn't have a remedy  

for dirty dishes  

screaming children.  

Mother,  

listening to the neighbors,  
gave my sister and I  

a large tablespoon  

of cough syrup.  

The codeine slowed us down  
and put us to sleep.  

When she died,  

the neighbors brought  
hams and sweets,  

sent sympathy cards.  
There was no funeral.  

I was taken on vacation,  
flown away to California  
to forgive and forget.  

Every day I remember.

Letting Go  

unsteady. swerving  
the revolutions of her wheels  
dissect flecks and patches of color  
between their spokes  

the wedges of green lawn  

the red, yellow and blue flowers  
are spaced and intersected  

by the sun and sky:  

her wheels and spokes  

churn heaven and earth  

away and wobbling  
round and round  

each revolution creates a centrifugal force  
that spins out the landscape  

the spate of trees  

lawns and houses  

that mark her journey  

and are outdistanced  

in her turning wheels;  

from handlebars to pedals  

and up through the black perch  
of her seat  

from ‘horizontal to vertical  

the flow  

marks the points of intersection  
of metal and flesh:  

she moves from her black perch  

off the seat  

feet down on the pedals  
up down and around  
pedaling swiftly  

her feet mark the circumference  
the inner circles the pedals make  

as gliding and coasting past  
the row of houses  

she stands upright  

one foot on each pedal  

feet flat out on the axis  
the diameter that marks  

the circuit of each;  

basking in the glow  
the success of her first ride  
she glides past  

houses and trees  

the spaces between them hold  
shards of sun  

that sun that moved down  

a channel of sky  

followed her journey  

to the end of the street  

and now smiles down  

on the Lord's child.  

Sweet Lilly  

Weep for me -  
not.  

of simple Sundays  
when the lilies  
bloomed each day  
before noon.  

By twilight -  
their passing was  
but a matter of  
closing,  
Their petals, painted upon  
memories stretched —  
behind my eyes.

The Temple of Mithras  

I take thee, love  

My Sleeping Cat  

on the kitchen floor against the baseboard  

time line to the past  
in dreams  

in his long curl of tail and limb  
time Old Egypt  

strange sensation.  

one by one gathering  

to roll (there is no other word)  
down left then right cheek  

and drop from chin to chest.  

have cried various ways/various times  
never like this: free and gentle  
rising up from fields  

lying fallow  

in the sun  

not peeling an onion.  

an onion  
ends  

— Bonnie Johnson  

my missing link, my completion  
from forever until forever  
I take thy laughing eyes  
thy laughing mouth  

for mine; thy breasts  

thy legs, and the joining of them  
to be my own  

that sweet pleasure  

I give and take all measure  
of love and caring  

all manner of sharing  

my soul and thine  

eternity pledged in blood  
in wine, in tearless  

agony alone, and  

long before we met  

yet shared  

call it love and  

hope to comprehend  

this dear mystery?  

this cryptic gift  

for which I thank  

the Gods of this place

in dreams  
asleep in dreams  

five million years of evolution  
in his long curl of tail and limb  
my sleeping cat enfolds within
