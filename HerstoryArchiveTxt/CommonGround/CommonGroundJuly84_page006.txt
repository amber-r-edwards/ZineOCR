allow the cervix to regenerate nor-  
mally. All three are simple proce-  
dures which can be done on an out-  

patient basis.

Cryo-surgery is a newer technique  
and has several advantages over  
cautery. It is less likely to be  
painful, produces a more uniform area  
and depth of tissue destruction,  
causes less scarring and is less  
likely to cause narrowing of the  
cervical canal. Laser surgery is an  
even newer technique, however, and is  
not generally available. The use  
of laser requires special training  
on the part of the physician. Its  
advantages are similar to cryo-  
surgery and it can be even more pre-  
cise in tissue destruction with fewer  
complications of bleeding and in-  
fection.

If the cervical abnormality ex-  
tends into the cervical canal or if  
you're diagnosed with severe dyspla-  
sia (abnormal cell changes of the  
cervix), then conization biopsy is  
usually recommended. The wide part  
of the cone-shaped tissue sample is  
toward the vagina while the point of  
the cone will extend up into the  
canal. Cone biopsy allows a more  
thorough examination of cervical  
tissue beyond the view of the colpo-  
scope. This is a major medical pro-  
cedure and is done in hospital  
under general anesthesia. Conization  
may result in long-term side effects  
such as fertility problems or preg-  
nancy complications.

These issues should be discussed  
with the doctor before the procedure.  
Conization may be the only treatment  
necessary to remove all abnormal cells.  
However, in some cases hysterectomy  
may be suggested. Hysterectomy is  
recommended when pregnancy is not an  
issue, when severe dysplasia or cancer  

in situ (already present) are detected  
during conization, or when repeated  
follow-up exams would present a hard-  
ship to the women.

You and your clinician will want  
to consider several factors when de-  
ciding on treatment for abnormal cer-  
vical changes: your feelings about  
future pregnancies, your age, other  
medical problems, the severity of  
abnormal changes and your family  
medical history.

In conclusion, cervical cancer  
is a very treatable condition, es-  
pecially when detected at an early  
stage. The Pap smear is the single  
most important screening tool for  
detecting early cervical abnormalities.  
Women who have regular Pap smears are  
less likely to develop invasive  
cervical cancer. We should all have  
regular Pap smears and should be in-  
formed so we can decide on a course  
of action if we get an abnormal result.

Pap smears are available at local  
doctors and clinics, at Planned Parent-  
hood and as part of the free Cancer  
Prevention and Detection Clinic of  
Roswell Park. For information, or  
to sign up for the clinic, call 845-  
4400 between 9:00 a.m. and 4:00 p.m.,  
Monday through Friday.

Dear Common Ground:

Just a note - Excellent article on the  
Conference Report: Dimensions of Racism.  
Although I was present, it is refresh-  
ing how well the ideas generated were  
captured by Gerri Bayer and E.R. Mann.  
Many thanks for increasing awareness,  
through your publication, of this  
effort.

YWCA Conference: Dimensions of Racism  

Dear Common Ground:

Jack Kemp is to be honored and is com-  
mencement speaker at Buffalo State this  
year. I feel women should protest his  
being honored. I myself wrote to  
President Bruce Johnstone and the  
Alumni Office over the selection of  
Kemp. Personally, I am bothered very  
much by Kemp's hawkishness (he voted  
for every weapons procurement there  
has been), but I feel women in our  

community should write and protest  

his being lionized in Western New York.  
Not only is Mr. Kemp anti-ERA, but his  
tax cuts (of 25% under the Kemp-Roth  
bill) favored the wealthy, helped  
bring on the budget deficits and led  
to all those budget cuts that hurt  
women.

Kemp has even been embarrassed by the  
consequences - cuts affecting educa-  
tion, job training, nutrition. But  
Kemp is an ultra-conservative, and  

as such, his voting record is quite  
anti-woman, anti-minority, anti- Demo-  
cratic. Ultimately his actions will  
have hurt our national economy (he  
refuses to back down on the tax cuts)  
and our local economy (even county  
budget deficits can be traced to  

state deficits, all the way up to  
national deficits).

Kemp has hurt women by championing  

greed and laissez-faire. Far from  
being honored, I feel he should be  

exposed. A number of us should protest.  

Maybe then President Johnstone would  
get the message. Kemp is no hero.

Kemp is not the kind of man who is  
truly manly. Macho, ultra-conserva-  

tism, at our expense, reeks. (It  
reeks, anyway). Maybe then local  

males would get the message too.  
We don't like what Reagan has done,  
or his boy, Kemp. It is not the  
"way to go". We protest. We raise  
cain about it. We raise a little  
hell about it. We don't just sit  
“quietly by".

Sincerely,  
Joan Van de Water
