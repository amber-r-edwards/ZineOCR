THEATRE REVIEW:

Kavinoky's "I'm Not Rappaport"

by S.M. Beck

Aging. Not a subject people
like to face--but face it we must.
We will see it in ourselves or our
companions--the little creaks here
and there, the squint when we read
the paper, the sounds we hear seem-
ing quieter somehow, possibly even
the need to provide care for an
elderly parent or loved one. The
Kavinoky Theatre managed to bring
us face to face with the dilemmas
faced by older adults and their
children in their excellent pro-
duction of "I'm Not Rappaport” by
Herb Gardner.

A sensitive comic-drama, the
play revolves around two elderly
men who meet on a bench in Central

Park. Saul Elkin portrayed the
definitive Nat--an old Jewish
immigrant with revolutionary ten-
dencies, abundant chutzpah, and a
firsthand working knowledge of fan-
tasyland. Cashmere Ellis was
Midge, the black building super who
tries to maintain his position past
retirement age by cultivating "invi-
sibility". He had the same easy
believability that he had as a
young suitor in TOY's "Fool For
Love". Neither of these two tre-
mendous talents are on stage often
enough it seems, and to have them
perform together was an inspired
bit of casting. The two work well
together--and the scene in which
Nat and Midge get stoned in the
park was a real high point.

Another all-too-rare onstage per-
formance was Darleen Pickering Hum-
mert in the role of Nat's daughter
Clara. Although her hectic schedule
as Senior Staff Assistant with U.B.'s
Department of Theatre and Dance
leaves her little time to be on-
stage, the roles she does manage to
fit in are sensitively crafted and
bring out the essence of the charac-
ter beautifully. Her credits in-
clude a bag lady who wants to live
in McDonald's in "Talking With--

finally locates her father in the
park, and in a powerfully moving
scene they re-examine their rela-
tionship, past, present and future,
as she tries to convince him to
allow her to supervise him. Their
interplay held all the anguish,
love and frustration that could
build in the situation without
once feeling overbearing or heavy-
handed. Hummert feels that people
tend to identify strongly with the
scene because the dilemma is one
that many envision themselves.

Other cast members include
Steven Cooper, Eileen Dugan,
Michael Russo and Guy Wagner.

The Tony Award winning play
uses humor to deal with a very
serious subject. In with the
laughter is the realization that
yes, it’s not all golden in the
later years, the events depicted
do occur, and often. In a time
of "Social Security which wouldn't
pay the rent for a chipmunk" we
need to address the concerns of
the elderly in a positive manner
which will allow them personal
freedom and dignity. As Nat said:
"We are the survivors...We are
your coming attractions".

Torch Song Trilogy is a very
funny, provoking and moving film.
It is the story of Arnold (Harvey
Fierstein), angst-filled drag
queen who searches for love,
commitment and self-affirmation
in the gay demi-monde of the 1970s.
This film is an adaptation of the
successful Broadway production of
Torch Song Trilogy, propelling
gay themes out of the sideshow and
undercurrents of plays such as
The Dresser or Death Trap, and
into center stage. The movie
suffers a bit from its stage-
parental origins with clever char-
acter introductions and “exeunts",
and by rather rigid timing of
humor: on stage the characters may
pause while the audience recovers
composure, with a movie the audience
laughs over several lines of con-
tinuing dialogue, interrupting the
flow of the story.

The film exposes and plays upon
a wide range of emotions, taking
the audience on a roller coaster
ride with the dramatic and crisis-
filled life of Arnold.

Fierstein opens Arnold's life
up to the audience; his relation-
ship to his mother (Anne Bancroft),
the creator of "original guilt";
his lovers Ed (Brian Kerwin) and
Alan (Matthew Broderick) and his
co-queens at the club where he
works. Working these characters
in three "acts", Fierstein effec-
tively sketches the range of
dilemmas gays face in living out
their lives and loves. I won't
say any more and give the already
well-known plot away, but do go see
this while it is "still up".
