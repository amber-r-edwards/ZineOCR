A Conductor
Speaks:

Mary Louise Nanna

I really have very little to

say to all of you this evening
and congratulations to the other
recipients. Mine is, and has
been, the world of ideas, emotions
and musical expression - and the
day-to-day world of the arts. The
former is not necessarily associated
with the latter - for me,
though, it is. My world is not
cut off or far removed from the
realities of hand-to-mouth, day-
to-day living. It is not somehow
more palatable than the normal
dog-eat-dog associations and con-
cerns of all of us here. It is,
though, I admit, incongruous to
imagine all these manifestations
of struggle and frustration with
something so seemingly (and truly)
wonderful as Music.

But, my friends, the music

world (which as I have said before
can be far removed from music) has

its stratifications, its caste
system, its power struggles and
the bittersweet, if curious, con-
tortion of “one step forward, two
steps back."

Women in this field, as in so
many others, are respected and

admired because they have achieved.

Yes, but moreover, because they
are vitally needed. They are
valued foot soldiers - valiantly
putting forth a supreme effort
many times for those who are much
less talented or gifted - and by
so doing making the success

story happen - but for someone
else, usually a man.

I'll say it this way: women
are musicians, rarely conduct-
ors; secretaries, rarely bosses;
congresswomen, like Gerry Ferraro
and rarely - well let's just say
whether it's for President or

the Podium - the Big P that gets
in the way of Progress for all
of humankind, not only women,
is - Power.

When one considers the great
number of symphony orchestras in
the U.S., be they major, regional
or metropolitan (without even con-
sidering the world), and then
realizes that women as conductors
of any moderately significant
involvement with these orchestras
can be counted on the fingers of
one hand, it is truly a disgrace
of enormous magnitude and of
course can be most discouraging.

What keeps one going? I guess
it's the love of music and the
determination to spread that love
and by so doing convincing by
creating.

My message to you: Create with
your talents a right and fair
world, a just and loving place
for all human beings in your own
circle of influence and move for-
ward with determination and you
will convince! Here's to ever
growing and widening circles!
Here's to all of you! Foot sol-
diers - I Salute You!

MARITAL
RAPE

Conviction

upheld

The rape case that drew
national attention to the
Buffalo area has been resol-
ved in the New York State

Court of Appeals, which ruled
that the exemption in the crim-
inal law that allowed husbands
to rape their wives was uncon-
stitutional and could not
stand. The ruling also stated
that the statute discrimina-
ted against males and declar-

ed that husbands could be pro-
secuted for raping their wives.

This landmark decision was
reached in People vs. Liberta,
which originated in Buffalo.
Liberta appealed a lower court
decision for which he was
imprisoned for the rape of
his wife. The law then allowed
a married woman to accuse
her husband of rape if they
were living apart by court
order.

The ruling further said,
"there is no rational basis
for distinguishing between
marital and non-marital rape."
Exempting married women from
protection under the law vio-
lated the equal protection
clause of the state and fed-
eral constitutions because
it discriminated against
married females and did not
provide equal protection
under the law.

The original law that was
changed by the Court of
Appeals did not allow a
woman who lived with her hus-
band to charge him with rape.
The ruling said that the old
law was "based on the archaic
notion about the consent and
property rights incident to
marriage" and could simply
not stand even to the slight-
est scrutiny.
