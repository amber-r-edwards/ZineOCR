INTERNATIONAL WOMEN'S DAY

"Women In Buffalo: Where Do We  
Go From Here?" is the theme of the  
International Women's Day celebra-  
tion. The event is being held at  
the Downtown YWCA on Friday, March  
8 and Saturday, March 9.

Beginning at 7 pm on Friday, the  
YW will be the site of a multi-media  
and multi-artist event, "A Sampler  
of Women in the Arts". The YW's  
ballroom will become, for the dura-  
tion of the evening, a center for  
women in the arts. There will be  
poetry, dance, theatre and  
the fine arts.

WAND (Women's Action for Nuclear  
Disarmament) will be displaying the  
Buffalo segment of the Pentagon rib-  
bon. Work by local women artists  
will be on display.

Music and poetry are on the  
evening's agenda. Five of Western  
New York's best known women poets  
will read short selections of their  
work. Some of our local folk singers  
will be there to keep the music going.

Gemini Dance Theatre will perform  
a tribute to Katherine Dunham, a  
modern dance pioneer. Dunham created  
a form of modern dance that blended  
traditional African dance movement  
with American modern, to create a  
uniquely American mode of expressive  
dance.

Stiller Dawson, of the Buffalo  
Entertainment Theatre, will present  
a performance art piece. Ms. Dawson  
wrote and developed this piece as  
a one-woman show.

The evening's entertainment is  
free. Snacks and beverages from  
local women vendors will be avail-  
able. Children are welcome.

On Saturday, March 9th, the YW  
will be buzzing with a wide array of  
activities of interest to women.

The topic of the opening panel  
discussion is "Women in Buffalo:  
Where Do We Go From Here?", which  
will address the state of the local  
women's movement as of this year.

One point of planned discussion will  
center on whether or not there is a  
women's movement in Buffalo in 1985.  
All opinions are gratefully accepted.

A wide variety of topics will  
be covered by the day's workshops.  
Sexual abuse prevention for children,  
fat liberation, women's art, women  
in unions, and pro-choice issues are  
just a few of the topics that will  
be covered that day.

Craftswomen from our area will be  
displaying their work for perusal and  
sale all afternoon. Local women's  
businesses and groups will be setting  
up informational tables. There will  
be films, childcare, a raffle and  
good food and beverages until 5 pm.

As the sun goes down, the banners  
and flashlights will go on for the  
"Take Back the Night March". Women  
are invited to join the IWD coalition  
in marching for our rights to safe  
homes and safe streets. The planned  
route is in the Downtown area, to  
end at the YW.

ings, call EMMA, W.N.Y. Women's

"She knows she is innocent,"  
God.

The Allegheny County jury con-  
victed Leslie on first degree man-  
slaughter in 1984 and sentencing  
was delayed in order to file an ap-  
peal.

The appeal for a retrial was  
granted last fall. The higher court  
said that it had not been disproved  
beyond a reasonable doubt that Les-  
lie had acted in self-defense, and  
that the conviction was invalid.

This past January, Leslie's attor-  
ney went back to Allegheny County  
to work toward a retrial, possibly  
with a change of venue. Cleary,  
the attorney, was told that a new  
trial would take at least three  
months, including six weeks for jury  
selection. He was offered the option  
of plea bargaining.

Emick was informed of her choices  
and opted for plea bargaining. "She  
wants to get on with her life,"  
her sister Sharon Fougner said, “but she wants to get on with her life."

"She doesn't want to put her  
children or her parents through a  
trial again," Ms. Fougner said.

"The emotional and financial toll  
in this kind of thing is just  
enormous."

In pleading guilty, Ms. Emick  
gives up her right to a retrial,  
the right to being proved innocent.  
"It was a relief to Leslie to know  
it was over, whatever the outcome,"  
Sharon Fougner said.

Leslie Emick is now a nursing  
student living not far from her  
parents in Maryland. She is involved  
with a self-help group for battered  
women and other community activities.

Sharon Fougner said that choosing  
the guilty plea was the result of  
family and financial conditions.  
"Leslie's children are getting older  
and more aware now. You can't put  
children on hold while all of this  
is going on. My parents too have  
been emotionally worn out, and the  
expense of this trial has devastated  
the family. We could deal with the  
emotional strain or the financial  
strain, but not both. They are too much.”
