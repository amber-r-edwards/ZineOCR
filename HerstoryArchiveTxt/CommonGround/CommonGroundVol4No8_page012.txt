house of cards

more abortive goodbyes  
in parked cars  

engines running  
marking time  

like digital  

watches  

I drive aimlessly  

in early morning  

hours  

obeying traffic lights  

that deftly manage the lack  
of traffic  

coming home  

to close the door  
and I touch myself  
where no one has for  
for so long  

and turn over  
spreading my hand  

onto the spaces next  
to me  

a definition  

of a bed  

that I could fill with  
stuffed animals  

as an adolescent might  

in crowded places  

I remember love  

vulnerable  

frail  

and many a difficult morning  
faces the same coffee mug  

I remember friendships  
old, worn  

and comfortable  

as last winter's  

house slippers  

this winter  

earlier that night  

I lay my hands flat on the table  

stretching out antennae fingers  
to know the surface texture  

I rubbed conversation  
into the grain  

once more  

just once more  

tell me  

we're to be friends  

cards toppled  

and the touches  

I coveted  

not given  

not ever to be given

so much depends  

on the changing  
of the moon's faces  

sometimes  

it seems to be  
our last validity  

so we mark its passage carefully  

knowing  
that our marking  

may be our only real control over fate  

new blood or no  

relief and pain become the same  

&-now  

for you  
diana turns cruel in laughing  

forgetting it seems  
she is sister to us  

still

for jimmie  

in the photo  

new logs stumble  
over each other  
roll to a-halt  

at the bottom hills  

above them an only tree  
an only tree  

stands crooked  

in the confusion  

looks down at this  
slaughter  

stretches its damp gaze  
slowly  

to the old house  
where the girl and  
her horse  

never appear  

in the photo  
even the land  
aches for  
her past

ROME BIRTH - JULY 4, 1983  

Trickles of pain signal its onset  
At dusk, amid fireworks and heat.  
Room forms to fill out, no wheelchairs for the weak.  
I kiss my son goodnight,  
His final day an only child.  
No straps, no unnecessary sterility.  
Contractions strengthen and I sweat.  
Loved ones and midwife lend support.  
No rigid rules, no IVs.  
Soon pain swallows me whole.  
Coffee and conversation keep the others from fading.  
No medication, no monitors.  
Fingers massage my full belly, hands rub my back.  
Encouraging words mend my broken spirit.  
No unknown faces, no needles.  
With dawn comes depression;  
Will this labor ever end?  
No stirrups, no drapes.  
Suddenly, new agony tunnels through me.  
Trained hands stretch my vagina wide.  
No stitches, no scars to mend.  
For a moment, I think I am dying.  
Then a daughter's face renews my life.  
No whisking baby away, no sugar water between nursings.  
New calm, near silence ends our morning,  
As we meet this new child, in awe.  

Only a woman's strength  

Can give birth to another woman,  
And home is the place  

To do this.
