VOL. VI, NO. 1 SEPTEMBER 1986

by Judith Geer

On Wednesday evening, July 23rd,
Mary Ann Sorrentino, Director of
Planned Parenthood of Rhode Island,
spoke at the Center for Tomorrow
at the University of Buffalo. Her
speech concerned her year-long
battle with the Roman Catholic
Church over her association with
Planned Parenthood, an organization
which the bishop of her diocese
concluded was wrong in its pro-
abortion stance. Ms. Sorrentino
had been Executive Director of
Planned Parenthood of Rhode Island
since April 1977.

A “welcoming” committee of
about 60 anti-abortion demonstra-
tors (over half of whom were men)
chanting, "Stop killing babies,"
greeted the audience of over 170
who attended the talk. Extensive
media coverage including a lengthy
article in the BUFFALO NEWS (follow-
ed in the next few days by several
letters to the editor), and num-
erous TV news items preceded Ms.
Sorrentino's appearance in Buffalo.
Consequently security was evident
throughout, but no regrettable
incidents occurred.

Ms. Sorrentino began her talk
with, "My name is Mary Ann Sorren-
tino and I am a Roman Catholic."
She said that in spite of her
excommunication she can no more

stop being a Catholic than she
can stop being an Italian-American;
it is simply too much a part of
her being. The circumstances
surrounding her excommunication
are these: on May 4, 1985, she
received a phone call from her
parish priest telling her that
there was a problem concerning the
forthcoming confirmation of her
15-year-old daughter, Luisa. She
was directed to bring her daughter
immediately to the church rectory
for a conference. She phoned her
husband to meet her at the rectory
and collected Luisa from school,
still not entirely sure about the
nature of the hastily-arranged
meeting. However, she had enough
suspicion to insert a tape recorder
into her straw purse and surrepti-
tiously make a recording of the
conversation with the priest.

Ms. Sorrentino said she learned
more about her daughter during the
15-minute interview than she had
in the first 15 years of Luisa's
life. The priest asked her over
and over what her personal opinion
was concerning abortion. Finally

Ousted Catholic
Keeps Her Faith

Luisa said that she didn't think
she would ever have one for her-
self but as for others, she just
didn't know.

After Luisa left the room, the
priest told Mary Ann that she should
not come forward for communion in
the future because she had "auto-
matically excommunicated herself"
from the church. She had never
heard of such a process but she
later found out that one of the
criteria for automatic excommuni-
cation is procuring or helping
someone else to procure an abortion.
She was highly incensed that church
officials would use her daughter
in this round-about fashion to get
to her and felt she was singled out
for punishment for reasons of blind
ambition more than anything else.
The bishop in her diocese is young
and a “go-getter;" someone who
needed to make a “splash" with the
powers-that-be in the church hierarchy
in order to advance his career. She also felt that she
became a target because she is a
woman. She pointed out that
several priests in her diocese
are under indictment or in jail
for sexual misconduct with minor
boys, but none of these men was
excommunicated.

Although she was told she could
be reinstated if she gave up her
association with abortion clinics,
