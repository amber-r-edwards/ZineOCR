GENERAL ANNOUNCEMENTS

FAMILY HEALTH CARE is available

at four Erie County Health Depart-
ment Comprehensive Health Care
Centers, which provide adult
medical services, pregnancy care,
pediatric and dental health ser-
vices. For more information, call
846-7690.

STOP HLA TASK FORCE is a letter-writing
group which seeks to educate and lobby
our elected officials about legislation
concerning the reproductive rights of
girls and women. It was established
three years ago in response to the
threat of a Constitutional Amendment
(the Human Life Amendment) which would
have established that human life
begins at conception, therefore out-
lawing abortion and certain types of
birth control. The focus has broad-
ened to include any and all federal,
state and local rules and regulations
that would restrict a woman's choice
of a safe, legal abortion, including
Medicaid funding for abortions. They
have written hundreds of letters in
support of family planning programs,
sex education programs, and against
cutbacks in Medicaid funding for abor-
tions as well as proposed legislation
restricting or prohibiting access to
safe, legal abortions.

Meetings are twice a month, from
September to May or June, either the
first and third or second and fourth
Mondays of the month, depending on
scheduled holidays. For more infor-
mation, call Paulette Hammond at
631-3967 (between 5-6:30 p.m. is
best) or Gail Willsby, 831-2969
(8:30-5 p.m.).

THE COALITION

724 Delaware Ave - Buffalo, NY 14209

We are a diverse group of
concerned individuals: con-
sumers, parents, childbirth
educators and health care
professionals.

We believe that birth is a nor-
mal, healthy life event.

We believe all childbearing
women have a right to high
quality, economic prenatal
care, birthing and child health
services.

We are interested in learning
about and changing the
environment in which we give
birth and work.
