SUBSCRIPTION INFORMATION

COMMON GROUND is seeking material
for a special issue of "Women's
Culture" for September. The Amer-

ican Heritage Dictionary of the
English Language defines the word

"culture" as:

1) The totality of socially trans-
mitted behavior patterns, arts,
beliefs, institutions and all other
products of human work and thought
characteristic of a community or
population.

2) A style of social and artistic
expression peculiar to a society
or class.

3) Intellectual and artistic
activity.

We need articles, photographs,
essays, editorials, poetry, art;
deadline for submissions, August 1.

POLICY

PHILOSOPHY — Common Ground is potentially, with
help from Western New York women, a forum to
celebrate the rich diversity of our community. We view
the paper as a ribbon that may connect our
commonalities, our intersection points. We are inviting
you to participate actively in the building of a support
system for WNY women. We affirm our commitment to
enhance the lives of women on physical, educational,
spiritual, psychological, social and economic levels. We
want to present, fair-mindedly, the issues that concern
women, and information of value to women. We offer
Common Ground as a place where women can display
their art and personal literature, and review the
tapestries of their experiences.

EDITORIAL POLICY — Common Ground is especially
looking for articles which address the needs and
interests of local women.

1. Common Ground is a publication of news, culture
and dialogue from women’s perspectives.

2. News, Opinion, Analysis and Commentary will each
be clearly labeled as such.

3. We are seeking to provide accurate, straightforward
information of value to women.

4. The collective will not intentionally print or support
materials or viewpoints which will harm women
because of color, sexuality, religious or ethnic
background, physical disability or economic situation.

5. While opinions expressed in Common Ground are
those of the authors and not necessarily those of the
collective as a whole, we do accept responsibility for
choosing what we print.

SUBMISSIONS — We welcome articles, letters,
information and announcements of interest to women.
Graphics, cartoons, art and photography will be
gratefully received. We especially invite women who
do not usually have access to traditional media —
women of color, differently abled, economically or
educationally disadvantaged, and those for whom
English is a second language — to write. Suggested
length of letters: 250 words. Letters must be signed to
be printed. We will, however, respect your privacy and
withhold your name if you request. Suggested length of
articles, commentary, analysis: 500-750 words. Please
type and double space your work, 40 characters across.
If you do not have access to a typewriter, please print
clearly. In time we hope to have a typewriter, paper,
etc., available for those who request it. Include a
stamped, self-addressed envelope and work and home
phone numbers. Because we want to hear your voices,
if your piece needs to be edited for length or clarity, we
will call you/ask you to do it. Keep copies of your work.
We will try to notify you within three (3) weeks if we
intend to use your work. If we print it, we will give you
five (5) copies of the issue in which it appears. Artwork
should be black and white copies only, and
title/describe your work. We will copyright the entire
issue, but the copyright on each piece reverts to the
author/artist, so that she may decide where her work is
printed. Please request a style sheet for further
information and guidelines if you want to write.
