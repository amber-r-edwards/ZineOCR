mi one  

Georgie Anne e  
of the more astute journalists  
in the national media. Her disarming  
smile and soft-spoken manner often  
mask questions flung with lethal aim;  
she does not suffer fools gladly.  
This impression of her television per-  

minds  

a is reinforced by reading her  
syndicated newspaper column (she is  
presently writing for Universal Press  
Syndicate) and her engrossing autobi-  
ography BUYING THE NIGHT FLIGHT. Each  
page of this fascinating work is  
packed with her impressions of the  
famous and infamous (some of them  
very surprising!), her continual ex-  
citement with her work as a journal-  
ist, and her explorations of self  

as a woman in an occupation almost  
totally dominated by men.  

Actually, Georgie Anne was one of  
the first female foreign correspon-  
dents, along with the legendary  
Dickie Chapelle*, beginning her work  

in that capacity in the mid-60's.  
Georgie Anne was raised on Chicago's  
South Side and from a very early age  
claims to have known she was destin-  
ed for a life other than wife and  
mother. Fluent in German (she spent  
a Fulbright year in Vienna), she  
quickly learned Spanish when an in-  
terest in Latin America resulted, in  
1964, in her receiving a grant to do  
foreign correspondence in Lima,  
Peru. Her employer, the  

NEWS where she was employed, to send  
her to the Dominican Republic. She  
arrived just after LBJ forsook de-  
mocracy there (he called the demo-  
cratic revolutionaries "communists"—  
sound familiar?) in favor of the  
Trujillo militarists. The puppet  
leaders that the Trujilloites placed  
in office failed again and again to  
put down the rebellion, led by poet  
Dr. Juan Bosch. Geyer recounts:  
The revolution went on.  
Day passed into day, and week  
into week as we Americans inter-  
fered in the strange island melo-  
drama on this bitterly hot and  
bitterly divided island. The  
American administration tried  
to impose leader after leader,  
one worse than the other. The  
rebels held their desperate  
lines in the Old City, until,  
in contravention of everything  
we were supposed to be doing  
there, the American marines let  
the Dominican military through  
their supposedly ‘neutral’ lines  
to attack the rebels. Those of  
us in the press corps and em-  
bassy who believed in a different  
United States were sick at heart  
—and bitterly angry at our  
country. (p.71)  

Over and over throughout this book  
the events sound like distinct echoes  
of current American foreign policy.  
One can only conclude that when it  
comes to Latin America we still know  
little and care less; just send in  
the marines!  

In 1966 Georgie Anne went to Cuba  
—at the invitation of Fidel Castro—  
and conducted extensive interviews  
with the enigmatic leader.  

Castro, who after all was  

a big, earthy man, left me with  

no feeling at all. I even felt  

a certain effeminacy in him,  

something I would not have trust-  

ed had not other women who met  
him backed up this view. I am  
not in the slightest suggesting  
homosexuality. Castro had had  
lots of women. Rather I think  

I was seeing for the first time  

a man for whom women and sex were

WOMAN DOING HERE? is another goodie!  

name of the

with  

self as everything (p. 81)  
Later  
meeting stro,  

of the U  
that there is little  
lute it. Finally, a seemingly inno-  
cent, discrete romance between Georgie  
Anne and a young Cuban so offended  

one of Castro's lieutenants that  
Georgie Anne cannot to this day obtain  
a visa to return to Cuba. The cap-  
riciousness of power is a continual  
source of wonder!  

In reporting on Castro and other  
powerful world leaders Georgie Anne  
constantly had to wrestle with the  
old journalistic bugaboo of "fair-  
ness" (a dilemma portrayed so vivid-  
ly in the current film UNDER FIRE).  
She describes her solution to this  
enduring problem as follows:  

There was always the  

nagging question of 'truth'—  

the basic question of course.  

Do you 'truthfully' report a  

society like reporting what they tell you, when  
you know they are lying? Do  

you report what you suspect?  
What dissidents tell you?...  
I did work out ways of doing  

things. I could, for instance,  
work on two levels: the stated  
and the implied. Even if I  

was doing a lot of good for his  
people, I could judge and say  
that with utter dispassion  

and fairness. Equally, as  
much as I love my own coun-  
try, I could always judge where  
it was being just and effect-  
ive in its policies and where  
it was not. (p. 87)  

Steadfast adherence to this  
philosophy may certainly be one  
reason Georgie Anne is so respected  
by world leaders and why she gains  
interviews with some of the most  
elusive of them. Her impressions  
of Salvador Allende [a weak, sad man],  

Che Guevara [a phoney], Anwar Sadat  
[one of the greats of our time] and a  
host of others are intriguingly drawn  
here. In her opinion, however, her  
sex did play a part in why so many of  
these normally reticent interviewees  
were all too willing to talk with her.  
This reason is not as some of her more  
uncreative male colleagues would have  
it that she's "slept" her way into  
the confidences of the great and  
mighty but:  
because “something about a  

woman interviewer puts men at ease.  

They sit there and sooner or  

later everything pours out.  

Men forget that they are with a  

journalist and respond as they  

do to women who have always and  

throughout all time been the  

listeners and the comforters.  

At times I have felt guilty about  

this ‘advantage’. But after  

clearly telling men that I am a  

journalist, I do not feel it is  

my duty to maintain eternal  

vigilance and keep warning them."  
(p. 109 - 110)  

Georgie Anne also attributes her  
empathy with developing Latin American  
and African nations to the fact of  
her womanhood.  

As I observed these developing  
nations and peoples, I under-  
stood their complexities; I  
felt with them in their traumas;  
I comprehended their absurdities.  
The revolution within me and  
within women had many of the  
same components of the revolution  
that they were going through.  
This also gave me a kind of

freedom and perhaps special em-  
pathy in reporting. For I treat-  
ed these people with respect,  

yet I did not feel I had to  
pamper them because, in truth,  

I was one of them. (p. 103)  

In a society such as ours where  
many of us revere the First Amendment  
as one of the most brilliant concepts  
the human mind has ever created, we  
are in constant need of journalists  
who have the piercing  

clothes on. We have  
a journalist in Georgie Anne Geyer. This is an  
exciting, thought-provoking book; a  
real eye-opener!

Review by Joan Shaddox Isom  

Marion Perry's poetry makes us all  
re-examine the people, places and ex-  
periences that have left spaces within  
our own lives. And if the images pain  
us, is it not better to have that  
emptiness filled with something?  

Here is a poet saying for us what we  
may have imagined was our own private  
vacuum: "Pain has its own life/ a  
space in the closet/ the vacuum of a  
death discovered forty years later..."  

Don't we all have photographs in  
our family albums, pictures of fat-  
cheeked, laughing babies who died so  
soon they never acquired an actual  
name? Known as “The Baby," he emerg-  
es at holiday dinners in stories of  
his innocence, his impish pranks, sea-  
soning our feast with his presence.  
And seldom do we stop to think that  
this child would be a middle-aged  
man with thinning hair and a mortgage  
from which he would never free himself.  
The Baby. Eternally young, delight-  
ing us until we realize, finally, the  
vacuum his brief presence (his actual  
presence) caused in the lives of  
some.  

Perry takes us to a house where  
she lived as a child and left a mes-  
sage stuck in a niche in a closet to  
prove to the future tenants that she  
did indeed exist: "I left a dollar  
there/ and said in a note/ that we  
were happy in this house/ Which is  
not entirely true.../ It's more/  
that when you mow a yard so many times/  
It begins to grow in your veins/...  
Such images dredge up memories of  
a dog's paw print pressed one summer  
day into wet cement, and a childish  
scrawl proclaiming that here was a  
beloved animal who deserved to be  

immortalized, Initials cut into  
porch planks, messages scribbled in  
the back closets, all yearning to  

be discovered  

that our names will  

be spoken by others even after we  
have taken leave. And by this magic  
we become more than a written word,  
more than a photo.  

This poet travels backward and  
forward in time effortlessly, never  
losing the reader who breathlessly  
follows, always arriving back at the  
and I am remind-  
of Tess Gallagher  

day, as Time  

Machine,” in which she states:  
...This conception of time  
as an atmosphere as the "now"  
of a poem, which Paz calls  
"the Historical Now" or the  
"Archetypal Now", is what I  
would like to call "the point  
of all possibilities." By  
this I mean that point at  
which anything that has  
happened to me, or any past  
that I can encourage to en-  
rich my own vision, is allowed  
to intersect with a present  
moment, as a creation, as in  
a poem...  

Perry understands this concept  
well, as evidenced in her poem,  
"Scott Hubbard." "You came / to me  
from me/ on the bouncing boat you  
had arrived/ I recognized your eyes/  
They were mine, my father's, his  
mother's/ And now my gift to you..."  

But solemn themes give way to  
humor occasionally, as in "The Ped-  
iatrician," a humorous barb aimed  
at the medical profession which, in  
this case, provides a tattooed map  
of the child's internal organs  
(purchased at birth under a special  
plan):  

“We also offer/ an alternate  
plan/ in which we make a body suit/  
for the child to wear/ with the in-  
ternal map printed on the suit./  

The suit must, however/ be changed  
immediately/ every time the child  
grows an inch/... And her poem, “On  
a Friend's Leaving,” holds humorous  
wishes laced with a touch of practi-  
cality:  

"May your children always need  
you/ when you have time/ and be indi-  
pendent when you don't/ May your  
students learn/ at an alarming rate/  
and your superiors always/ like your  
programs/...  

But in the end it is the time-  
lessness of the poems that stays  
with us, as Perry takes us into space  
and spaces too deep for us to fathom  
alone, but she guides us steadily,  
firmly:  

"I would walk toward water/ And  
like water leave/ Turn to mist and  
stars over oceans/... She becomes  
our envoy as we plumb depths and make  
discoveries that rend, tug and pain,  
but at the same time, fill, sustain  
and embody.
