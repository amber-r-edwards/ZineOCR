The serpent was framed! Here we  
are between St. Patrick's - that mix  
of Christian legend and green beer -  
Passover and Easter. Seeing all those  

cute little green snakes (no, I wasn't  

drinking the green beer) in shows  
and on cards set me thinking about  
the legend of Patrick driving the  
snakes from Ireland,  
wisdom and religious fallacy in cen-  

eral. Conclusion: the serpent was  
framed!  
Those of you who know snakes know  

they shed their old skins. The  
ancients thought the serpent to be  
immortal; it didn’t die, just crawled  
out of its old skin and slithered  
on its way. Early on the snake be-  
came a symbol of eternal life. Not  

a bad beginning and had the serpent  
and Eve just taken off together  
instead of talking to Adam things  
might have stayed that way.  

You remember Eve and the garden.  
Didn't we all learn some from that  
one? The serpent tempted Eve, who  
tempted Adam, and everyone had a  
few bites of forbidden apple. In  
doing so, the humans gained know-  
ledge of good and evil and had to be  
evicted from the garden of Eden lest  
they eat from the Tree of Life and  
live forever. The major concern  
of God, as we learn the story  
from Genesis, seemed to be the threat  
of Adam-man becoming like the  
God. Eve and the serpent were  
merely cursed for eternity.  

Take another look. Don't con-  
vict the serpent yet. The Mother  
Goddess in Babylon was attended by  
her snake. In Crete, She is de-  
picted holding snakes in each hand.  
The Hindus know her as Kundalini,  
who, in uncoiling brings infinite  
wisdom through the chakras. The  
Greeks depicted Hera tending her  
magic garden in which the tree of  
life grew guarded by her sacred  
serpent. The Great Mother, accompanied  
by her serpent, offers the fruit  
of the Tree of Life to humans!  

In the Hypostasis of Archons (part  
of the Gnostic library found at Nag  
Hammadi and not to be confused with  
the Dead Sea Scrolls) is this telling  
of events in the garden, quoted by  
Pagels:  

“And the spirit endowed Woman came  
to (Adam) and spoke with him, saying,  
‘Arise, Adam.' And when he saw her,  
he said, 'It is you who have given  
me life; you shall be called  
"Mother of the Living" -- for it is  
she who is my mother. It is she who  
is the Physician, and the Woman, and  
She Who Has Given Birth.' ...Then  
the Female Spiritual Principle came  
in the Snake, the Instructor, and  

it taught them saying, '...you shall  
not die; for it was out of jealousy  
that he said this to you. Rather  
your eyes shall be open, and you  
shall become like gods, recognizing  
evil and good.’...And the arrogant  
Ruler cursed the Woman ... (and) the  
Snake." Snakes were also often  

depicted representing the male princi-  
ple -- as phallic symbols.  

By the time of the alleged St.  
Patrick (most likely invented by 9th  
century c.e. monks who attempted to  
place him in the 5th century c.e.,  
though one might note that Ireland  
was still being Christianized in the  
12th century c.e.) it is no wonder  
we get a story about driving snakes  
from Ireland. Whether the snakes  
were to be seen as companions of the  
Goddess or symbols of the male, both  
belonged to pagan Ireland and Goddess  
worshippers. As symbols of wisdom and  
the Instructor, the serpent would be  
an anathema to monks unable to deal  
with wisdom or definitions of good  
and evil not of their own making.  
Drive out Wisdom! Drive out the  
Instructor! Drive out the Goddess!  
Claim the shamrock, symbol of the  
triple Goddess who in pagan Ireland  
would have been called Morrigan-Badh-  
Macha, shows the Christian trinity.  
Curse the Koman! Curse the serpent:  

Both were framed.  

In the process of reclaiming  
through feminist witchcraft and women's  
spirituality, women have added  
many rituals and celebrations to the  
traditional great holidays.  
Let us propose another. Let women set aside  
March 17 as a day of reclaiming and  
celebrating. Perhaps we should call  
this holiday the Calling of the Ser-  
pents. We could make this a day of  
women's gatherings to call back to  
ourselves the symbols, the wisdom,  
the Instructor, the Great Triple  
Goddess -- to recall and reclaim  
all of our culture which the Patricks  
have driven out. In symbolic  
visualizations we can stand atop  
Patrick's hill in Ireland and call  
those serpents home. In our groups,  
covens, or alone we can reclaim our  
herstory and share it with other  
women. For ritual we might try  
surrounding ourselves with the sound  
of traditional Irish music -- the  
traditional has its roots in the  
Goddess-centered, pagan, Ireland.  

We should speak the names of the  
Goddess and tell the stories and  
use the symbols until these are ours  
again. Finally, perhaps as a closing  

ritual for the Calling of the Serpents,  

slice an apple crosswise. Discover  
the magic pentagram of the Goddess  
hidden within the apple. Share your  
apple with your sisters. Call the  
serpent.

Book Review  
Pioneer Women’s Voices  
from the Kansas Frontier  

by Joanna L. Stratton, published  
by Simon and Schuster, 1981,  
319 pp.  

Review by Deborah A. Jop  

It all started when Joanna  
Stratton was in the attic rum-  
maging through her grandmother's  
belongings. What she found was  
stacks of yellowed papers--let-—  
ters and recorded anecdotes from  
nineteenth century women who  

went to the American Midwest (Kan-  
sas, in particular) in order to  
start a new life.  

PIONEER WOMEN - VOICES FROM  
THE KANSAS FRONTIER is the result  
of Stratton's efforts to sift  
through, synthesize and edit  
these written records of women's  
quietly courageous lives. Many  
of these letters tell of the  
day-to-day hardships of caring  
for a home and family in their  
newly-discovered western ter-  
ritory. These people were at  
the mercy of the elements. There  
are gripping testimonials of  
snowstorms and blizzards that  
would paralyze entire villages  
for weeks, until a group of men  
could organize to shovel a path  
to each cabin and replenish their  
food pantries (often set away  
from the house itself). Sum-  
mers, as well, could be brutal  
in Kansas. If it were too hot,  
the plants would be scorched;  
too dry and there would be a total  
crop failure. Particularly  
compelling are some of the wo-  
men’s descriptions of the sea-  
sons when the locusts descended  
and literally covered the area.  

Although PIONEER WOMEN does,  
of course, emphasize the hard-  
ships and how these women dealt  
with them, it also allows us a  
peek at the lighter sides of  

their lives.  
Their descriptions of such things  
as neighborliness, square dances  
and even warm and amusing relation-  
ships with some of the local  
Indians are delightfully written.  

Generally the narratives are  
descriptive and colorful, making  
it the kind of book the reader  

wants to snuggle up with on a  
cold evening beside a crackling  
fireplace. At the same time,  
however, you realize that you're  
getting an enlightening histori-  
cal sense of the era in which  
they lived.  

This book covers a lot of ground,  
from the trek out west in the cov-  
ered wagon, to the travails of  
war, and onto the women's suffrage  
movement. In fact, just as one's  
appetite becomes whetted in one  
area, along comes another woman's  
story about an equally fascinating  
subject, leaving the reader with  
the slight frustration of wanting  
more. All in all, though, I  
would heartily recommend this  
book as thoroughly enjoyable and  
informative reading to anyone in-  
terested in women and their struggles  
to survive on an American  

frontier.

science degree from the University

sistance to the aged.
