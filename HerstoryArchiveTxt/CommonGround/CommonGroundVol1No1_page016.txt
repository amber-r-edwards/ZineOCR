ANNOUNCEMENTS

announces

a number of courses for women specializing
in the needs and concerns of women. One of these, "Women in Contemporary
Society 214" addresses the realities of
women faced with the responsibilities of
work and family. Women have less time
for themselves and fewer opportunities
for getting together with one another to
discuss the difficulties they face. This
course is an introduction to the study
of how social roles and economic conditions
affect women's lives and define
their sex roles. This takes the form of
exploring women's personal experiences
through class discussion and relating
that experience to the reading material.
It provides a forum for coping with
stress and developing a positive self-image. Class meets Thurs 6:30-10:00pm,
Main Street campus, starting Sept 2.

For more info call 831-3405.
