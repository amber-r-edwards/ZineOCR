BEGINNING WITH

by Silversmith

Considering herstory and time by
wimmin's calculations, we have arrived
at the autumn of 9984 ADA (after the
development of agriculture -- a major
accomplishment of wimmin), and are
approaching Hallowmas/Samhain, the
witches' New Year celebrated on
October 31. A good time perhaps to
reflect on wimmin, our symbols, and
the process of transformation.

By wimmin's reckoning, the labrys
appears in our herstory and culture
about year one. In its original
form, the labrys was not the double
axe familiar to feminists of today,
but a butterfly. These images,
along with caterpillars,
and chrysalises, are first
found in southeast Italy
and are images associated with the
Great Goddess and symbolize Her and
our cycles of rebirth, regeneration,
and transformation. Often the labrys-
butterfly was depicted between the
horns of a bull.

To these ancient

peoples the bull

horns, due to ex-

tremely fast growth

and crescent shape,

were a moon symbol.

The Goddess was

believed to emerge in

the form of a butter-

fly (or bee) from the horns of a dead

bull.

In fact, as the symbol

became more axe-like

and less the butter-
fly, the butterfly was often depicted
on the blades of the axe. The labrys
never, in these early millennia, was
meant to imply either a weapon or a
tool. In fact, the symbol of the
labrys developed several thousand
years before these peoples had metal
axes for tools or weapons. Nor did
the bull horns represent male energy.

Excavations of Late Minoan sites

on Crete, especially at Knossos,

have brought to light numerous
shrines to the Great Goddess, both
of public and private natures. Such
altars were common in homes of the
Minoans and included the "horns of
consecration" and the labrys. As
a free-standing component of the
altar or shrine, the horns have a
hole in the center
in which the labrys
was placed. The
Great Goddess as a
source of life-power, bringer of
transformation, rebirth and regen-
eration, is again found with the
symbol of the moon (bull horns as
crescent moon) which also rep-
resents the Goddess and the process
of cyclical transformation.

Minoan culture was most certain-
ly matrifocal and the labrys, as it
came to be known in Italy, Crete,
Greece, in the Halaf culture through-
out the Near and Middle East and
along the Tigris River, was a wimmin's
symbol belonging to the followers
of the Great Goddess.

Nowhere is the labrys shown in the
hands of men until about 4000 to
3500 years ago.

As patriarchal Indo-European
peoples swept across southern
Europe, the Near and Middle
East, the matrifocal, Goddess
oriented cultures were conquered.
The shrine to the Goddess at Delphi,
a major center of culture and rel-

igion, fell to men and Minoan
civilization disappeared. Our labrys
was taken by men who were called
"labrydae" or axe-bearers. The
labrydae assumed a function similar
to that of scepter bearers. Even-
tually, it appears, that the labrys
may have been used to sacrifice
bulls to the Goddess. If, in fact,
this ever happened it was not the
original use or meaning of the labrys.

With the emergence of stories of
Amazons the labrys is first truly de-
scribed as a weapon. It may have
been carried into battle by Scythian
wimmin. It was reported as the
weapon of Thermodontines (Amazons)
ranging from the Sarmatian plains to
the Aegean Sea. How appropriate that
the first symbol of wimmin's culture
would become: the weapon of wimmin as
patriarchal tribes imposed male rule
and religion across southeastern
Europe and the Middle East!

Except for ‘legends' of Amazons,
the labrys disappeared from our con-
sciousness about 2000 years ago only
to re-emerge as archaeologists and
anthropologists of the past 200 years
turned their attention to the Minoan
people of the Goddess. As wimmin in
the last 20 years have moved to
reclaim our cultural heritage, we
have also moved to take back our
labrys -- we wear it; pins, pendants,
earrings, buttons, rings -- we
incorporate it in our posters, book
covers, record jackets, event announ-
cements. Most importantly we have
reclaimed and remembered. We have
forged a link with our neolithic
foremothers. We know more of our
symbolic herstory.

Many explanations and mean-
ings are attributed to the
labrys by today's

wimmin: some see
it as a wimmin's
weapon, a statement
of our op-
position to our
patriarchal
society; some see it as a link with
our matriarchal past, a symbol of our
cultural power; some see it as a
Lesbian symbol derived from our
Amazon mothers; some associate it
with the Great Goddess and wear it
as followers of our Great Mother.
To many, it combines more than one
of these connections with our
culture and our herstory.

Again the patriarchy is attemp-
ting to take our symbol and use it
as a symbol of male violence and
power over. In the TV cartoons and
then in the character dolls, a
great muscle-bound He-man, Master of
the Universe (?) carries a labrys.
He has defiled my cultural/religious
symbol: He has insulted the Great
Mother! He has taken my beautiful
symbol of regeneration and trans-
formation and tries to make it an
ugly symbol of destruction! The
labrys is mine, is ours. He can
never achieve power-over with my
power-within.

Another word we all know which is
derived from labrys is "labyrinth",
the house of the double axe. The
Oxford Universal Dictionary notes
"labyrinth" as Greek -- of “unknown
origin" (again, so much for the
dictionary), but the definition is
"an intricate structure of inter-
communicating passages, through
which it is difficult to find one's
way...". Webster's New International
adds the problem of finding one's way
from the entrance to the center or
vice versa in the labyrinth. The
journey of wimmin in the 9980's
is most assuredly through the laby-
rinth. Once we enter and begin to
find our herstory, our cultural
past, our religion of the Goddess,
we seek the center. Our centers.
Our power-within. Our womyn
identities. Our transformations.
The way is difficult. Wrong turns.
Dead ends. Cartoon he-men who try
to steal our treasures. Two steps
forward, one step back. But we
keep going. Try to leave signs for
other wimmin. We hold the labrys--
whatever it means to each of us.

We will learn the secrets of the
labyrinth. We are butterflies.
We are Goddess.

UNTITLED

Love is like a
branching out in
directions.
Sometimes calm,
Sometimes rising un-
g and r
manding
turbulence is ine
tip-toe on the ‘line as both
are capable of smothering.

FAITHFUL AW

I saw a woman in a bar tonight

She was as aware of me as I of her.
Expected glances were welcome,
Nerves began to gossip,

Thoughts were
feelings looking for an exit, yet
wanting to be kept safe.

Aware of my faithful
feelings,

I can only say

"I saw a woman in a bar tonight."
