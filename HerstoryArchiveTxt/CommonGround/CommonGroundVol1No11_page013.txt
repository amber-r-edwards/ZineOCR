Locally, Erie County Medical Center  
(ECMC) physicians have announced that  
there are two patients being treated  
for AIDS in Western N.Y. Both are  
gay men and neither are Erie County  
residents. They are being taken care  
of at ECMC.  

AIDS has been called “America's  
number 1 health priority” by U.S.  
health officials. The disease has  
been labeled as the cause of death  
for several correctional center in-  
mates in three states. Nurses, prison  
guards, social service workers, police,  
firefighters, and even sanitation  
collectors have asked governments for  
protection against the disease.  

However, researchers have found no  
credence in the theory that AIDS can  
be transmitted through casual contact  
with a victim. They are 'now sure'  
that sexual contact is one way of  
passing the disease, because hetero-  
sexual women who have had sexual re-  
lations with male AIDS sufferers  
(who were intravenous drug users)  
have come down with the disease.  

Blood-donor programs have suf-  
fered from the AIDS scare. Both don-  
ors and recipients are afraid of con-  

tracting the disease. NYS health of-  
ficials have said that the chances  

AIDS (Acquired Immunity Deficiency  
Syndrome) has become a strong concern  
among government health officials and  
community groups. The disease, which  
makes the victim susceptible to exotic  
infections and some kinds of cancers,  
has been causing a nation-wide scare.  

From the time of its discovery in  
1981, AIDS has claimed 550 lives and  
there have been nearly 1500 diagnosed  
cases since then. The disease, which  
is apparently transmitted through sex-  
ual contact, dirty hypodermic needles  
and blood transfusions, has claimed a  
high percentage of its victims from  
the male homosexual population in  
large cities. The federal  
government has appropriated 16.5  
million dollars to find the cause of  
the disease.  

Betty was seized with panic as  

she realized her faithful friend was gone...  
raised her consciousness  
about a  
on the streets!  
he doesn't know  
proper birth  
control!  

Suddenly, she saw a familiar  
canine profile. Sure enough,  
it was...  

I'm almost  
to the suburbs! APHRODITE!  
Where can she be?  

It's you!

my paw -  
that gets 'em  
every time.”
