A relationship in which people are
more than just content is hard to find;
in fact, there are not many who would
even claim to have attained content-
ment. Everyone has his/her own idea of
what works. Some are satisfied with
warm bodies who don't give them too
many headaches, while others want ex-
citement, passion, friendship and
understanding.

If you fall into that large cate-
gory of people who want to enhance
your partnership, there are eight
points that are useful to understand
and practice:

1. A relationship works when its
participants recognize that anger and
unhappiness often stem from demands
they make on themselves or their part-
ner. For example, your partner keeps
leaving his clothes all over the
house, even though you have asked him
to confine them to the closet and the
hamper. You feel angry and yell at
him when he comes home. The thoughts
that led to your anger were probably
along these lines: “He shouldn't

have left clothes all over the place -
what a total slob." If you question
this thought you will find there is an
alternative way to think: "Why must
he do what I want him to? Do I con-
trol his actions or does he have free
will? How does leaving his clothes
around the house make him a slob?"
Now, answer the questions like this:
"Of course, he doesn't have to do
everything I want him to, although I
wish he would...He is going to do
whatever he wants and all my ranting

and raving will not change that. Leav-

ing his clothes around the house doesn't
make him a TOTAL SLOB but someone
whose idea of neatness is not like my
own." You will notice that your feel-
ings will change from anger to irri-
tation, annoyance and disappointment.
Behaviors, too, will change from yell-
ing, to discussing the problem, to
brainstorming solutions together.

By ferreting out your demands or
"shoulds" and questioning them you
will arrive at new thoughts which will
lead to more rational feelings and be-
haviors. These, in turn, engender
greater harmony, less strife and more
realistic expectations.

2. For any relationship to flourish,
it is imperative that there be mutual
respect, and that each person feel
s/he is encouraged to grow and pro-
gress. When these prerequisites are
not met, both people may suffer, feel
used and resentful and worthless or
depressed. Where there is real re-
spect, people rarely feel as if they
are being taken for granted. It is
difficult to make someone respect
you, but by behaving in an assertive
manner, and thinking rationally, you
will increase your chances.

Respect translates into many things
including a high regard for the other
person's time. No woman who is in a
committed relationship should have to
be Superwoman: working outside the
home, being the primary caretaker of
the children, cooking meals, attending
PTA meetings, walking the dog and then
providing sexy, witty companionship
for her partner. There is very little
chance that a Superwoman can sustain a
truly happy union; the inequities in
the relationship preclude it. Of
course, most human beings will take
advantage of a situation in which lit-
tle is required of them, so it be-
comes each party's responsibility to
change this pattern, if it exists.

When each person feels as if s/he is
carrying equal weight, then true inti-
macy can develop, unfettered by power
issues.

An egalitarian does not split every-
thing exactly in half. There is com-
promise and flexibility. One person
may do more of the cleaning one week
and the other person the next. The
idea is not to be picayune about mun-
dane tasks but to strive for an equi-
table distribution of chores and re-
sponsibilities. If one person prefers
being the primary caretaker and home-
maker, and the other prefers to work
outside the home, that is equitable.
If an arrangement really works for
both parties, there is no problem;
however, if it is only satisfying to
one, there will be resentment and
friction.

3. It is common knowledge that keep-
ing a long-term relationship vibrant
and interesting requires "work".

What is meant here by the word "work"

is often baffling, as the details are
rarely mentioned. For many, "work"
conjures up all sorts of negative im-
ages and may lead to a defensive at-
titude when it is brought up. For
instance, the person who says "I
shouldn't have to work at this - if we
really love each other things will
naturally get better." Dream on. Any
on-going relationship of more than a
few weeks can benefit from some ef-
fort. Unions that have weathered
many years and still seem exciting are
those in which both parties understand
the meaning of compromise, communica-
tion, consideration, support and fun.
4. People sometimes think that if a
relationship does not naturally flow
smoothly they should forget it. This
is like throwing out the baby with

the bath water. For two people to
continue to cohabitate in relative
harmony, it is necessary for each to
make a sustained effort. To be more
specific, do not assume that your
partner has ESP and can divine what
you are thinking or feeling just by
gazing into your eyes. If you believe
that love equals clairvoyance you will
surely be disappointed, frustrated and
angry at your mate when s/he fails you-
which is inevitable. Instead, speak
up: Tell your partner what you like -
whether it is a preference for dinner
or a different touch in the bedroom.
If you are unused to behaving asser-
tively, this may be a big adjustment.
Persevere, it's worth it. If neces-
sary, take an assertiveness training
course.

5. Communication is another key in-
gredient in a good relationship. The
ability to articulate what you are
thinking and feeling shows that you
know your thoughts and emotions. Some-
times you may not; in those instances
it is best to communicate your un-
certainty or confusion, rather than be
silent. Generally speaking, people
like to know where they stand with
their "significant others". Not know-
ing, which may amount to not being
told, can lead to insecurity about the
relationship and sometimes, insecurity
in oneself.

One crucial aspect of communi-
cation is the ability to really hear
what the other person has said. If
you are not sure how effective your
listening skills are, try reflecting

back what you think you heard. For

example:

mate: I hate my boss!

you: It sounds like she did some-
thing especially irritating
today. Do you want to talk
about it?

mate: Yes. She didn't even look at
that report I spent all week
writing.

you: Are you taking this personally?

mate: Of course I am. I wrote the
damn thing!

you: I know that this must be frus-
trating for you, after having
worked so hard on it, but could
there be another reason why she

mate: Well, she said something about
having to prepare for a meeting
this afternoon, and being real-
ly swamped.

Not only will you show your partner
you understand, you will also be steer-
ing her/him away from the angry feel-
ings s/he was experiencing when the
conversation started. Your caring is
apparent in your involvement.

6. Support is a relatively easy con-
cept to understand. Distilled down to
everyday events, it means: even if
you would rather swim with sharks, you
still go to that Christmas party at
your in-laws - and behave yourself.

It also includes not expecting the
laundry to be done when your partner
is taking his/her medical boards the
next day. Attitude plays a big part
here. So if you go to that party and
wear a long-suffering look as you sit
in a corner by yourself all evening,
you are not being supportive.

Support is a good example of some-
thing that is better observed than
heard. In other words, if you tell
your partner that you are behind him/
her 100% that may be helpful; however,
the message would be stronger if you
acted in a supportive manner.

7. Similarly, consideration is best
when acted, rather than stated. It
consists of thinking of the other per-
son and acting unselfishly. An
important component of consideration
is patience and tolerance. It is not
uncommon for people to be tolerant of
others in general, but come home and
let the slightest remark from their
mate set them off. If you do not take
strangers for granted, why treat the
person who shares your life with less
respect?

8. No matter how well you get along,
it is inevitable that there will be
arguments. If you can learn how to
fight fairly, these do not have to
