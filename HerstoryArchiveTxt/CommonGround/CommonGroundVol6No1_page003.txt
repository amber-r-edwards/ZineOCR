W.L.C. Provides Healthy Food

For Area Mothers, Children

by Sharon Green

The federal government funds a
nutritional supplement program
for pregnant women, nursing women,
and young children up to age 5,
entitled Women, Infants, and Children
program (WIC). I've received WIC
for both my children and it has
been a wonderful help. However,
I'm often surprised at how many
women (including potentially
eligible women) are not familiar
with this program.

The purpose of WIC is to ensure
healthy babies and children.
Applicants must have relatively
low incomes, as well as a proven
nutritional need (such as low
birth weight in infants or low
iron in children). However, the
income cut-off is not as low as
one might expect. I suspect
there are many households with
at least one full-time wage earner
that might be eligible. In other
words, one does not have to be
extremely poor to receive WIC.
Furthermore, one does not have
to be receiving food stamps or
welfare in order to qualify for
WIC.

WIC applicants must produce a
signed certification from their
doctor. Any pediatrician can do
this, as can an obstetrician/gyn-
ecologist. Because good nutrition
is so crucial during pregnancy,
the WIC program includes nutri-
tional help during pregnancy.
However, many women never learn
of WIC until after their babies
are born. When you are accepted
into the WIC program, you must
also attend a brief meeting on
good nutrition before you can
begin receiving checks.

What exactly does the WIC
program include? Each month,
the woman or child receives 4
checks. Each check specifies
certain nutritious food items
that can be purchased. The
checks are good for one month,
and they can be used at all major
grocery stores in W.N.Y. They
can also be used in many smaller
stores; look for the sign on the
door or window stating that the
store accepts WIC.

A pregnant or nursing mother
receives food for herself, such
as milk, eggs, and cheese. A bot-
tle-fed infant receives formula
and baby cereal, and the exorbi-
tant price of infant formula
makes WIC especially valuable.
When the child is weaned, the WIC
checks then change to solid food.
To give you an example, my check
last month for my three-year-old
allowed me to receive, free of
charge, the following: 15 quarts
of milk, 2 pounds of cheese,

1 1/2 dozen eggs, 72 oz. of frozen
juice, and 36 oz. of vitamin-
fortified, low-sugar cereal.

On the back of each check is
a list of certain cereals, juices,
and cheeses which you can choose
from, and most grocery store
clerks are very assiduous about
checking that you buy the correct
items. Only highly nutritious
foods can be purchased. For
example, juices must be 100% pure
fruit juice, to avoid kids drink-
ing such beverages as Hi-C or
Hawaiian Punch. In fact, since
I've never received food stamps,
but have always resented food
stamp recipients who purchase
fancy frozen dinners, shrimp, and
other expensive items I can rarely,
if ever, afford, I've been espe-
cially impressed by the amount
of control over WIC food items.

The WIC checks must be picked
up and signed for once a month
at various sites throughout the
Buffalo area. However, I've
found the act of picking them up
each month to be difficult. Ama-
zing as it may sound, some Buffalo
sites are still not stroller
accessible. After observing sev-
eral dangerous juggling acts (a woman
alone, newborn in one arm, drag-
ging a buggy up or down a flight
of stairs), I called the WIC office
downtown. They claim that there
are simply no other spaces avail-
able in these neighborhoods. In
my opinion, vacant sites will mir-
aculously appear after the first
accident.

Another problem is the lengthy
wait. Forty-five minutes is a
snap for an adult, but to a hun-
gry baby (whose mother is often
a victim of our culture's double
standard about public nursing)
or an active toddler, 45 minutes
is an eternity. And it's an even
longer eternity to the mother in
charge of said baby or toddler.

After experiencing this scen-
ario countless times, I approached
officials with the suggestion of
a box of toys at each WIC site.
The toys could be donated by us
WIC participants, and various
other sources, and parents would
then have to supervise their own
children at play. However, my
idea met with more than one down-
turned brow. Officials seemed
to feel that a toy box would en-
courage some parents to ignore
their children, and WIC doesn't
want to be responsible for any
children. Perhaps there's some
truth in such sentiments. I also
feel, though, that their response
was indicative of society's gen-
eral apathy towards the needs of
children and their parents.

One bright note: you can
have up to two proxies who can
pick up the checks for you (that
is, if you are lucky enough to
know another adult able and will-
ing to do this).

Finally, WIC checks are only
issued on a six-month basis.
Every six months, your doctor
must re-certify you or your child,
based on a physical exam. In the
case of the infant or toddler, a
routine well-baby check is accom-
panied by a finger prick blood
test.

If you or a woman you know
would like more information about
the WIC program, call their office

Child Care
Resource &

Referral
Center

How can you tell if your child
will receive good quality day care?
The Child Care Resource and Referral
Center will work on an individual
basis with parents in need of
quality day care for children.
They have pamphlets and brochures
available with do-it-yourself
guidelines also. They offer re-
source, referral, and educational
services for child care providers
and employers.

CCR&ER information bank, staffed
by professionals and volunteers,
helps parents define their needs
and locate current openings in a
wide variety of child care settings
throughout the Niagara Frontier.
This service is free of charge
to parents and child care providers.
Information is now available on
centers, family day care homes,
preschools, before-school, and
after-school programs.

CCR&ER does not provide care
or place children in care. CCR&R
does provide information to
assist parents in determining
their needs and making informed
decisions regarding the care of
their children.

Consulting services include
technical assistance, training,
and on-site visits and are
available to child care providers
upon request, regarding any aspect
of child care.
