SIMPLE GIFTS SHELTER

*From Page 9

...Battered women is a feminist issue
...a human issue. Battering (at Sim-
ple Gifts) is seen in the context of
violence against women in society."

Speaking about what Simple Gifts
offers to a woman after she "gets
out", Stephanie emphasized that this
shelter tries to support women who
are making the internal changes ne-
cessary to live independently for
"that's what happens the most. Women
for the first time are living here
with other women. They say I don't
have to do it all myself. They share
child care, share the dishes. They
get to see another way of living be-
sides an abusive nuclear family situ-
ation. Some nuclear families can
isolate and trap women. Making
connections between women as women
is important to Simple Gifts."

When asked why she worked at Sim-
ple Gifts, Margurite spoke about these
connections. “I've been lucky in a
lot of ways and I know it. I have a
lot to offer (women who seek shelter
at Simple Gifts) and a lot to learn
from these women. It's really opened

my eyes to things I never knew existed.

Both workers stressed that they
saw the importance of women helping
women. Said Stephanie, "Why women?
Women need to support other women and
to make decisions about what kind
of help is needed and how it is to be
delivered. (Simple Gifts) would be a
different kind of organization with-
out that commitment... (We maintain a)
self-help philosophy. Part of the
benefit of being at Simple Gifts is
women helping women...giving support
breaking down the isolation, reali-
zing you're not the only one who has

ever been through this.”

Simple Gifts also exemplifies the
bind that shelters can get into when
it comes to funding. Funding with
strings attached (i.e. criteria for
accepting women, paperwork, etc.) can
blunt the effectiveness of a shelter
and put limits on who a shelter can
help. On the other hand, once shel-
ters get adequate funding, workers
can put all their energies into help-
ing women--not scrounging around, and
spending precious hours and energy
fundraising and educating people about
the necessity of giving dollars. How-
ever, privately raised dollars can be
spent on the shelter's priorities,
not necessarily where the state and
local government says it must be used.
So far, Simple Gifts has resisted
"money with strings" in order to
maintain its identity, but may soon
have to choose this kind of funding
without more community support.

Shelters also are no longer the
social issue "fad" they once were. A
former Simple Gifts worker talked
about funding priorities in Simple
Gifts in early years..."Runaways was
a big thing in the early 70s, then
women and child abuse came into
fashion, and then rape prevention."
She also talked about the Coalition
for Battered Women that helped set
up Haven House Shelter, and agreed
with the observation that once Haven
House was funded, general interest in
battered women decreased, and it was
evident that Simple Gifts was going
to be a necessary alternative shelter.

When asked what Simple Gifts
current long range plans were,
Stephanie said that they wanted to

start an aftercare program to follow
up on women who used Simple Gifts.
However, without a commitment from
those who make battered women and
women in crisis a priority, battered
and homeless women will not be proper-
ly served in this community. Both
Simple Gifts and Haven House are
seeking volunteers from the community
and need your help. (See announce-
ments for more information.) ©
