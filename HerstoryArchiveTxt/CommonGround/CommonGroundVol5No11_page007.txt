focuses not only on the author but  
draws on the unrecorded history of  
a whole people. In telling her own

When and Where I Enter: The Impact  
of Black Women on Race and Sex in  
America by Paula Giddings. Bantam  
Books, $8.95

Paula Giddings draws on speeches,  
diaries, letters and other original  
sources, to movingly describe how  
Black women have transcended the  
double discrimination of sexism and  
racism from the landing of the first  
slaves in the 17th century to the  
present.

In Her Prime: A New View of Middle-  
Aged Women by Judith K. Brown,  
Virginia Kerns and contributors.  
Bergin and Garvey, $14.95.

This book challenges our culture-  
bound stereotype of middle age in  
women as simply a time of "Middle-  
aged jitter" and “empty nest syndrome."  
In fact, middle age finds women more  
energetic and autonomous and less  
restricted than during the child-  
rearing years. Informed women will  
be fascinated by the author's reports  
of women in widely divergent cultural  
environments, ranging from the prim-  
itive hunter/gatherer tribes to late  
industrial societies.

Toward a New Psychology of Women  
by Jean Baker Miller. Beacon Press,  
$5.95

quoted by the New York Times Book  
Review as possibly being able to  
“help to change your life, not with-  
out risk, but without despair."

Now a classic that is a well-proven  
resource for women.

The Second Self: Computers and the  
Human Spirit by Sherry Turkle. Simon  
and Schuster, $8.95

Sherry Turkle writes about the  
effect computers have on us. She ex-  
plores the thoughts and feelings of  
children with computer toys and  
computers in the classroom, video  
game enthusiasts, home computer  
users, virtuoso "hackers", profession-  
al programmers, and artificial intel-  
ligence researchers. She finds that  
the computer, which appears almost  
to think, has provoked us to recon-  
sider what it means to think, to  
feel, and to be human.

Women Who Do and Women Who Don't  
Join the Women's Movement by  
Robin Rowland. Routledge and Kegan  
Paul, $8.95.

This is a book in which the author  
asked a variety of women to write  
about their lives and the reason for  
their alignment or non-alignment with  
the women's movement. There are 24  
contributors drawn from five different  
countries. The contributors create  
a diverse pattern of women's inter-  
pretations of “being female" with  
surprising similarities emerging  
between the two groups, particularly  
in terms of their experience of self.

and images women writers and artists  
have about women and aging."

Values and the Future by Annie Cheat-  
ham and Mary Clare Powell. New

“futurists" who traveled 30,000 miles  
to document the lives and visions of

Relate, 2) Women Create, and 3) Women  
Heal. A book that demonstrates and

Change in Latin America by Betty

My Mother's Body by Marge Piercy.  
Alfred A. Knopf, $7.95.

Marge Piercy's tenth book of  
poetry takes its title poem from one  
of her strongest and most moving  
poems--an affirmation of continuity  
and identity. Each one of her poems  
tells a story--about wandering luggage,  
her love of animals, the influence  
of a name, apple blossoms and black-  
berries, pollution--everyday topics  
that touch us all, presented to us  
in a way that makes them linger long  
after we put the book away.
