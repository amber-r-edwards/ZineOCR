Pro-Choice Strategies

by Paulette Hammond

This report begins a monthly
series of articles concerning the
reproductive health of women on
the federal, state, and local levels,
presented by the Pro-Choice Network.
We are aiming to present an overview
of important legislation, issues,
elections and events so that Western
New York women will be informed of
such items and can take appropriate
action to ensure the maintenance of
their reproductive rights, including
the right to birth control infor-
mation and access to contraceptives
and safe, legal abortions for all
women.

Federal Level:

Voters For Choice are requesting
donations to support pro-choice can-
didates for Congress against anti-
choice incumbents or challengers.
Among the pro-choice candidates are:
Claudine Schneider (R.-R.I.), Jeff
Laurenti (challenging incumbent
Chris Smith in New Jersey), and Lt.
Gov. Harriett Woods (candidate for
Senator in Missouri). Please send
whatever you can afford to "Voters
For Choice" 2000 P St. N.W., Wash-
ington, D.C. 20036.

Supreme Court nominations: By
the time you read this, the Senate
will have probably acted on the
Rehnquist nomination for Chief Jus-
tice. His nomination poses a severe
threat to abortion rights, as well
as to civil rights. The same holds
for Scalia, who would replace Rehn-
quist should he be elevated to
Chief Justice. Please urge Senators
Moynihan and D'Amato to vote
against these nominations by calling
them at (202) 224-3121 and/or by
writing them at U.S. Senate, Washing-
ton D.C. 20510. If the Rehnquist
nomination vote has occurred, please
thank (or protest) the Senators’ vote
against (or for) the nomination.

From the NARAL Legislative Update,
8/18/86: Federal Funding of Abortions
expanded by Senate Committee--Immediate
Action Needed:

The Senate Appropriations Commit-
tee approved an amendment to HR 5233,
(Labor /HHS FY*87) which allows
to pay for abortions for women whose
pregnancy results from rape or incest.
The amendment was offered by pro-
choice leader Sen. Lowell Weicker
(R-CT) and was approved by a 13 to
12 vote. (For a copy of the commit-
tee vote, contact the NARAL Politi-
cal & Legislative Dept., (202) 347-
7774.)

The current Congressional policy
on abortion funding, referred to as
the "Hyde Amendment", allows federal
funding for abortion only when the
life of the woman is endangered.

HR 5233 has passed the U.S. House of
Representatives with this more re-
stricted "Hyde Amendment" language.

Kate Michelman, NARAL Executive
Director said, "This is a tremendous
victory for pro-choice forces. It
is the first step to regaining pub-
lic funding for abortion for women
who depend on the federal govern-
ment for health care." The bill
must now go to the Senate floor.

This is likely to be the most impor-
tant vote on public funding for abor-
tions in the 99th Congress.

NEEDED ACTION: Contact your U.S.
Senator and urge him to vote to re-
tain abortion funding for women whose
pregnancy resulted from rape or incest.

SENATE SUBCOMMITTEE REMOVES ABORTION
PROHIBITION FOR WOMEN IN FEDERAL
PRISONS: On Wednesday, August 13th,
a subcommittee of the Senate Appro-
priations Committee removed a House
provision of HR 5161, the FY'87
Department of Justice appropriations
bill, which prohibited women in
federal prisons from having abortions.
This action by the Commerce, Justice,
State, and Judiciary subcommittee was
sustained by the full Senate Appro-
priations Committee in their commit-
tee mark-up of the bill on Aug. 14th.

State Level:

The major piece of news on the
state level is that State funding
for family planning was increased
to $10 million, mainly due to an
effective lobbying campaign by
supporters of family planning
around the state. All anti-choice
legislation was defeated. A number
of bills of interest to family plan-
ning supporters were enacted (con-
tact the Network for a copy from
Family Planning Advocates.)

Mark Green, Democratic candidate
for U.S. Senate (against D'Amato),
received the endorsement of the
NYS NARAL PAC and the NYS Women's
Political Caucus. Mark is a “de-
dicated, outspoken, and tireless
advocate of women's rights and
freedom of choice." (Rev. Beatrice
Blair, Chair, NYS NARAL) He deserves
the whole-hearted support of all
feminists.

Local Level:

Of interest to pro-choice women
and men in the 31st Congressional
District is the race between Jack
Kemp (R) and James Keane (D).
Nurses United determined from Mr.
Keane that "As a matter of con-
science", he is pro-life and does
not support "abortion on demand".
However, he does not support a con-
stitutional amendment banning abor-
tion, he does not support legisla-
tion "which would in any way limit
or threaten the existence of family
planning services, specifically
Planned Parenthood." He has also
stated his support on several
other occasions for the Equal Rights
Amendment.

Jack Kemp is an implacable foe
of women's rights and has supported
all anti-abortion legislation. While
Jim Keane is not entirely pro-choice,
he is an acceptable alternative to
Kemp, and Nurses United has endorsed
Keane for Congress based on the
aforementioned information.

The next meeting of the Pro-Choice
Network will be on Tuesday, Oct. 7
at the YWCA, 190 Franklin St.,
Room 230 at 7 pm. We will be re-
viewing the year and planning for
the future. Please join us, we need
your input. For further information

Women Playwrights
Con't from page 1

Africa and possibly Eastern Europe
and the Soviet Union. All would
be performed in rotation, with
lectures and workshops by top
scholars also scheduled.

Prentice, in an interview with
the Buffalo News, said, "It will
be a double opportunity both for
the playwrights...to talk among
themselves for the first time ever,
and also for the community to see
these plays and accomplishments by
women. And it will bring in distin-
guished scholars, and practical peo-
ple too, who have a lot to offer.

Kathleen Betsko Yale, who first
suggested the idea, called play-
wrighting "the last male bastion of
writing". Yale has talked with a
number of women playwrights in pre-
paration for a book to be published
in January. "During our 3 1/2
years of interviews, we have seen
the considerable courage and grit
it takes for a woman to continue in
this public art," she said. As women
playwrights are isolated and few, she
wondered, “Why not get them to speak
to each other...to see in fact if
there is a female aesthetic. Some,
including women, feel all true art
is genderless. I say that's wishful
thinking."

Book Review:

The Little School:

Tales of Disappearance &

Survival in Argentina

THE LITTLE SCHOOL: TALES OF DISAP-
PEARANCE AND SURVIVAL IN ARGENTINA

by Alicia Partnoy. Cleis Press,
1986. $7.95.

Alicia Partnoy was among the 30,000
Argentines who “disappeared” after a
military junta came to power in 1976,
and is one of the few who lived to tell
about it. Her testimony was quoted in
the final report of the Argentine Com-
mission for the Investigation of Dis-
appearance and helped bring about the
recent convictions of four junta gen-
erals in Buenos Aires.

This book is a writer's chronicle of
imprisonment in a concentration camp
near Bahia Blanca, which the military
cynically named “La Escuelita" ("The
Little School"). Very few voices,
much less women's voices, have emerged
from the "little schools" of Argentina.
Bernice Johnson Reagon describes the
twenty tales that make up The Little
School as a “long soft freedom love
song..."

At noon we wait to hear the
sound of the bread bag sweep-
ing the floor, that smell pur-
ifying everything; we wait to
touch the bread: crunchy out-
side, soothingly soft inside.
We wait for it so we can either
devour it with greed or trea-
sure it with love...When the

medium mixes with hunger, and
four claws of anxiety pierce
the pits of our stomachs, eat-
ing a piece of bread, very
slowly, fiber by fiber, is our
great relief. When we feel our
isolation growing, the world
we seek vanishing in the sha-
dows, to give a brother some
bread is a reminder that true
values are still alive. To be
given some bread is to receive
a comforting hug...

During her years as a political
prisoner, Alicia's stories were
smuggled out of prison and published
anonymously in human rights journals.

Cleis Press is an independent tra-
ditional publisher of progressive women's books.

ployment of the Handicapped.
