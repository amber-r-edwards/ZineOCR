PRESERVING THE PAST: Women’s Oral History  

REPORT ON THE BUFFALO WOMEN'S ORAL  
HISTORY PROJECT  

The women who started the Buffalo  
Women's Oral History Project -- Mad-  
eline Davis and Liz Kennedy -- set for  
themselves some ambitious goals. They  
wanted to produce a comprehensive,  
written history of the lesbian com-  
munity in Buffalo, using as the major  
source, oral histories of lesbians  
who "came out" prior to 1970; to  
create and index an archive of oral  
history tapes, written interviews,  
and relevant supplementary materials;  
and to give this history back to the  

community from which it derives.  
Through time, other women have worked  
on the project, Avra Michelson and  
presently Wanda Edwards.  
Why an oral history?  
The women on this project feel that little re-  
search exists which concentrates on  

"common" lesbians. We know about  
more famous women -- the artists,  
authors, and those who kept diaries.  
But those who are interested in  
studying the "invisible" women, must  
rely on oral histories; to collect  
the information you must ask the  
people who had been there. The  
study of the more famous individual  

women also does not reflect the so-  
cial history and development of the  
lesbian group as a whole, and par-  
ticularly the history of an area such  
as Buffalo.  

How did the lesbian community here  
grow, and what were the trends? What  
can we learn from the past?  

The research turned up many inter-  
esting facts. People have the image  
of lesbians in the 1940-50's as a  
group of "poor people who were forced  
to band together", whereas the women  
themselves have pointed out that they  
were conscious of banding together

in order to create a lesbian community.  

Who would have guessed that Buffalo  
had fifteen gay bars in the 1940's?  
To date the project has collected  
narrations from nearly 50 lesbians be-  
tween the ages of 30 and 72. The  
group has been primarily white, but  
includes Black, Native American and  
Hispanic women. Kennedy and Davis  
wish to publicly thank all the wo-  
men who have helped with this project,  
both with the narrations and the de-  
velopment of ideas. They are still  
very interested in locating more  
narrators from the community, par-  
ticularly Black lesbians and women  
over 50, to further develop their re-  

search. Those interested should con-  
tact The Buffalo Women's Oral His-  
tory Project, 255 Parkside, Buffalo,  
N.Y. 14214.  

It is important to realize too,  
that this work is not done alone and  
in a vacuum. It includes supplemen-  
tal research in medical cases, news-  
paper articles and networking with  
other research groups across the  
country.  

The Project has made a variety of  
presentations to date. They have in-  
cluded: “Methodological Issues In Re-  
searching Lesbian Oral History", and  
"Buffalo Lesbian Bars of the Fifties."  
The most recent presentation, Dec-  
ember 10, was "Roles in the Buffalo  
Lesbian Community in the 1940-50's"  

Their long-range goals include  
publishing a book, which could be one  
of the first historical studies of a  
working class lesbian community, and  
the establishment of ongoing archives  
to document the continuing develop-  
ment of the community.  

CG will carry an interview with  
the Project coordinators in a future  
issue.@
