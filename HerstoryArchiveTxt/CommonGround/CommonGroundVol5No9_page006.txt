The meanest person in the  
world is one who gives you a  
recipe and "forgets" to tell you  
the little things she does to  
make it special.

I collect cookbooks. One of  
my favorites was printed in  
Buffalo in the early 1920s. It  
is a mixture of recipes, quotations  
and homespun wisdom. Cookbooks  
were different in those days.

Recipes today lead you step  

by step, telling you to open cans,  
use large or small bowls and to  
turn on the oven. Life was  
simpler in Grandma's day. It was  
taken for granted that anyone using  
the cookbook would know all the  
basics. Take the recipe for pastry:  
"One cup flour, 1/3 cup fat, 1  
teaspoon salt, ice water to make  

a stiff dough."

Today the person submitting  
the recipe would be deluged with  
calls for more directions..."what  
kind of flour", "do I sift the  
flour", “is that 1/3 or 2/3  
cup of fat", "what kind of fat",  
“how much ice water", “how do I  
know when I have stiff dough",  
and “what do I do then".

I can sympathize with today's  
cooks. My mother's pie crusts  
were fabulous; light, flaky and  
utterly delicious. Once when I  
was about 10 years old, I asked  
her to tell me how to make a pie.  
The directions were simple: Put  
a pound of cold lard in a bowl  
and add the flour. Cut the lard  
into the flour with two kitchen  

knives. “How much flour", I in-  
terrupted. "Oh, you just add it  
until it feels right", she said.  
"But how do you know when it  
feels right", I asked. "You just  
know", she answered.

I wandered away when I learned  
that you also added cold water  
until it felt right. Guess I never  
learned how it felt when it felt  
right as my pies were never as  
light and flaky as mother's used  
to be. My mouth waters when I  
think of them.

One of my favorite cake recipes  
also left a lot to chance. "Take  
the butter left over from break-  
fast", it started. I always  
hoped the baker made her cakes on  
the same day of the week and after  
serving breakfast to the same peo-  
ple. Visions of cake batter bub-  
bling in a sea of fresh churned  
butter, or of cake dry as toast  
when the family had used mounds  
of butter on their breakfast pan-  
cakes, appeared to me as I read  
this recipe.

My cookbook has two recipes  
for “Lightning Cake". I guess  
even Grandma had times when she  
needed fast food. One recipe  
calls for: 1 cup of sugar, 1  
good cup of flour, pinch of salt,  
2 small teaspoonfuls of baking  
powder. Run above through a "sieve"  
(Yes, that's sieve, not seive.)  
Take the same cup (the good one,  

I imagine) 1/3 cup of melted  
butter; break 2 eggs into the  
same and fill with milk, whip  

well together; flavor with lemon.

Bake in floured tin in a moderate  
oven.

The other recipe called for a  
“Heaping" teaspoonful of baking  
powder and butter the size of an  

egg. Notice how teaspoons and  
tablespoons were always “ful” in  
those days but cups never were.

Fillers of homespun wisdom were  
sprinkled throughout the book; "How  
to Preserve a Husband", “Recipe for  
a Happy Home" among others. A fa-  
vorite was for "Stewed Scandal";  
“One scruple of truth, 2 grains  
of ignorance, 2 ounces of envy,  
2 ounces of malice, 2 grains of  
curiosity. Stir them well. Add  
1 whisperer, 1 backbiter, 20 excla-  
mation points, 10 shrugs, 10 nudges;  
1 afternoon for calls. Watch it  
closely, stir it frequently. Will  
keep for years." That recipe could  
be updated simply by substituting  
"coffee break" for "1 afternoon  
of calls".

One of the last recipes is  
"For Indigestion": One quart and  
pint of boiling water, 1/2 pound  
of brown sugar, 2 tablespoonsful  
Babbit's bicarbonate of soda, 10  
cents worth of essence of pepper-  
mint, 15 cents worth of liquid  
rhubarb.

Add to boiling water, 2 table-  
spoonsful of soda, the sugar, let  
stand to cool, then add peppermint  
and rhubarb. Take 1/2 wine glass  
at any time you feel distressed.

Seconds anyone? Obviously  
this writer takes no responsibility  
for the accuracy or results of  
these recipes. Those were the  
good old days.

Grandma always said "what's the  
sense of having things if you  
never use them?"  
I used my china cups, the glassware/even  
occasionally the  

Lately I've remembered that  

black shamrock dishes that were  

gifts for their wedding/and  
I always cook soup in her old battered kettle that  

popped corn/broiled syrup into candy/cooked  

mashed potatoes for every holiday dinner.

I turned in mid-air, something convulsed her//  
for years she would tell the story and  

never quite get to the end//I couldn't  

figure out what was so funny/but  

I always finished the story for her.

We played the piano together/harder  

music than either of us could manage alone.  
At first she'd take the right hand and  
leave the easier part for me//later she  
encouraged me to try the hard parts, the  
fun parts//finally we even tackled  

the “Rustle of Spring". Grandma said  

"If at first you don't succeed...."

Grandpa went out to work in the garage///  
I have her piano now//I keep  

a little rug on the bench  

like she did so the wood  

won't get scratched.

One summer I had terrible  

nightmares/she would come out in the  

night to hold me, stroke my hair, talk  
calmly and softly or sing while I lost the  
horror of the whiskery old man that always  
chased my brother and me//while I  

came back to the world.

I can remember  

Grandma said "a dull knife is more  

dangerous than a sharp one" and kept every  

knife in her kitchen glittering/but I  

don't like sharpened knives. Grandma told me  

the first version of walking in someone else's shoes  
a mile before you judge them: "You never really know  
why people do what they do...." she said.

She's a short little lady now/shrunk to just under  
my chin/I can hardly connect her with the  
beautiful young girl I have photographs of.

The beautiful girl some unknown admirer sent  
valentines: blue parchment and lace with  

gold flourishes.

One has a cupid, complete with  

bow and arrow and one  

Psyche, holding a nosegay of  

pansies//heart's ease they called it.

I had them framed in round  

walnut shadow boxes to match the parchment/they  

hang in the upstairs hall and I pause  

every time I climb the stairs to  

imagine that beautiful woman she  
must have been/that  

wonderful child.
