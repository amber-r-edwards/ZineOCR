again because she believed I  
was a feminist and had put  
her down for not having an  
abortion.  

The Pro-Choice Communication  
Network also has found  
the crisis pregnancy centers  
misleading as all the informa-  
tion is anti-abortion, and  
abortion is not considered an  
alternative. A PCCN counter-  
picket took place September  
21 at the Crisis Pregnancy  
Center at 3210 Main Street.  

One of the best places to  
call for advice or sympathy  
seems to be the Crisis Services  
line. There I was advised  
after talking that abortion is  
between a woman and any supreme  
being she calls God. Further,  
the phone conversation suggest-  
ed involvement in Planned Parent-  
hood, PCCN or NOW to counter  
the Right-to-Life people.  

Marilynn Buckham, Buffalo  
GYN Womenservices administra-  
tor, says most abortions there  
are given to women ages 16-  

24, from Western New York,  
Canada and Pennsylvania. 95%  
say that they have support  
in their decision; 95% bring  
a support person with them.  

Buckham reports some name-  
calling particularly among  
men brought to the clinic as  
support and the Right-to-Lifers.  
She also states that patients  
are expressing a great deal of  

anger and frustration at the  
demonstrators.  

A 32-year-old Canadian woman  
who came as support for a friend  
told me her thoughts on the group,  
“They would make more sense if  
they acted like people instead  
of prophets. It is easy to be-  
come emotional when you feel  
righteous."  

No one can deny free speech to  
the protestors but if they are  
too loud or the police receive  
calls they will be taken to the  
police station. If no one  
presses charges, they will be  
released.  

In this case police refuse to  
press charges themselves as  
they consider this issue too  
controversial.  

However, a spokesman for the  
Buffalo Police Commissioner  
states, "Anyone who breaks the  
law will be arrested."  

Police presence is obvious  
at 260 Elmwood, particularly  
Saturdays when two patrol cars  
are parked within view and  
consistent patrol is maintained  
on Elmwood and through the plaza  
parking lot.  

What is denied the protestors  
is the right to harass, trespass,  
obstruct access to the clinic and  
invasion of a woman's constitution-  
ally granted right to privacy.  

The Right-to-Life group does  
not seem to understand abortion  
historically. It was practiced  
in ancient societies and through-  
out history until the mid-1800s.  
So-called humanitarian reform  
and religious bias helped make  
abortion illegal at that time.  

New York State realized that  
women must control their own bodies  
to be able to control their lives  
in society and made abortion  
legal on demand through the 24th  
week, in a medical facility with  
an attending doctor, in 1970.  

In 1973 came the Supreme Court  
ruling that a woman's right to  
privacy—including abortion—  
was guaranteed by the 14th  
amendment.  

Right-to-Life does not seem  
to understand abortion in a  
societal context.  

The New York Times found in  
a recent poll that over 60% of  
Americans believe abortion is  
a private decision.  

In 1984, 6700 abortions were  
performed in Erie County.  

A woman who does not feel she  
should have a child at a  
particular point in her life  
will always find a way to abort.  

This frontal attack by  
Right-to-Life groups, not only  
in Buffalo, but nationally has  
led to hundreds of bombings,  
burnings and vandalized abortion  
clinics since 1977.  

Since January of this year  
abortion clinics have been

RIGHT-TO-LIFE CLINIC COUNTERPICKETED  
By Mary Dickson  

Three television stations and  
two radio stations covered the  
September 21 counterpicketing of  
the Crisis Pregnancy Center at  
3210 Main Street.  

The picket was organized by  
the Pro-Choice Communication  
Network.  

40-45 people passed out leaflets  
and carried signs to let the  
public know that the Crisis Preg-  
nancy Center is an arm of local  
Right-to-Life groups.  

The center purports to pro-  
vide pregnancy tests and alter-  
natives for pregnant women.  

However, women who have gone  
to the center give a different  
account.  

A pregnancy test is performed  
and then pregnancy is over-  
estimated by weeks (apparently  
to discourage abortion.) Women  
are given anti-abortion lit-  
erature, Right-to-Life propa-  
ganda and subjected to religious  
rhetoric.  

They also view graphic anti-  
abortion films. Several women  
report they were actually  
locked in while viewing the films.  

PLANNED PARENTHOOD CLINIC  
TO OPEN  
By Mary Dickson  

A new Planned Parenthood  
Clinic will open in West Seneca.  

Three hearings were held by  
Health Services Agency of West-  
ern New York. The public had the  
opportunity to present opinions  
at these hearings.  

Right-to-Life attended all  
three meetings, gave opinion  
and tried to prevent the approval  
of the clinic.  

Nonetheless, the clinic was  
approved and Right-to-Life left  
one meeting en masse.  

The new clinic will provide  
birth control and not abortion  
services.  

The Pro-Choice Communication  
Network will provide escorts  
for the patients from the opening.  

Margaret Snell, contributing  
columnist to Common Ground (From  
a Laborer's View) has just returned  
from a thirty-day fact-finding  
tour of the U.S.S.R. Ms. Snell  
traveled in the Russian Federated  
Republic, visiting Moscow, Lenin-  
grad and Repino on the Bay of Fin-  
land. She visited Kiev in the  
Ukraine and the site of Babi Yar,  
where thousands of Ukrainians of  
the Jewish faith along with Soviet  
prisoners of war of all faiths  
were slaughtered by the Nazis.  

Ms. Snell visited Stalingrad,  
the site of the great and historic  
battle that halted the Nazis'  
march and was the turning point of  
the war. Ms. Snell visited the  
offshore oil wells of Azerbaijan  
and its capital city of Baku. She  
met with Soviet elected officials,  
trade unionists and economists.  
Ms. Snell would be happy to answer  
objectively and to the best of her  
knowledge any and all questions  
concerning the U.S.S.R. submitted  
by the readers of Common Ground.  

bombed at a rate of one every  
two weeks.  

The persons responsible for  
this terrorism are not necessarily  
members of Right-to-Life but  
are obviously sympathetic to the  
Right-to-Life philosophy.  

The Federal Bureau of Inves-  
tigation is finally, through  
pressure by Pro-Choice groups  
and concerned citizens, inves-  
tigating this violence.  

Womenservices administrator,  
Buckham says the harassment of  
staff, doctors and women seeking  
abortions is “domestic  
terrorism."  

She goes on to add that the  
tactics used by the anti-  
abortionists are those of  
domestic terrorism regardless  
of whether it occurs in Lebanon  
or Buffalo.

NOW - PAC ENDORSEMENTS  

The Political Action Committee  
representing the Buffalo Chapter  
of the National Organization  
for Women announced its endorsements  
for Mayor, City Council and County  
Legislature. PAC Chair Heidi Jane  
Siegfried said, "We believe that it  
is imperative that candidates who  
are sensitive to women's issues and  
women's rights be elected to public  
office." Sixty-five years ago women  
gained the right to vote. Women  
worked and died for that right for  
fifty years before obtaining it.  
Now the gender gap is growing because  
women realize the need to vote their  
own interests rather than simply  
following the lead of men, and NOW’s  
endorsements support candidates who,  
in their view, support NOW's issues.  

NOW PAC examined the voting re-  
cords of incumbents, and questioned  
candidates on a variety of issues  
of importance and concern to NOW  
locally. Endorsements are based  
on the candidate's “sensitivity  
to barriers women face in their daily  
lives and...perceptions that the  
candidate is a consistent advocate  
of women's agenda," according to  
NOW's press release. No candidate  
received NOW's endorsement unless  
they support the ERA, are pro-choice,  
support lesbian and gay rights and  
support affirmative action as a  
remedy for discrimination against  
women and minorities.  

NOW's endorsements are:  
Mayor: George K. Arthur  
City Council:  
Delaware - Alfred Coppolla  
Ellicott - James Pitts  
Fillmore - Dave Franczyk  
Masten - Dave Collins  
Niagara - Joal Giambra  
North - David Rutecki  
University - Archie Amos  
County Legislature:  
Fourth District - Joan Bozer

ference here in the Queen City.  
They have already made the first  
cut of cities interested. On  
September 12, Lois Reckitt, Nation-  
al NOW Vice President was in town  
to tour Buffalo hotels and other  
aspects of the local area to help  
determine Buffalo's suitability  
as a NOW Convention site for '88.

OBESITY IS A DISABILITY  

The Court of Appeals (5-1) de-  
termined that “obesity” qualifies  
as a disability. As a result, as  
long as the condition is not shown  
to affect job performance, obesity  
cannot be used as grounds for not  
hiring someone. Based on this  
finding, the Court reaffirmed an  
Order of the Commissioner of  
Human Rights directing the Xerox  
Corporation to hire a woman who  
was approximately 100 pounds over-  
weight.

tion (May 7, 1985)  

LIFE INSURANCE IS NOT SUPPORT  

Based upon Domestic Relations  
Law Sections 236 and 240, the  
Court does not have the right to  
modify any portion of a pre-equit-  
able distribution requiring life  
insurance, since it has been de-  
termined that life insurance is  
not considered "support".  

Lindbloom v. Lindbloom  
(July 12, 1985)  

POLICE RESPONSIBLE FOR INFANT  

Police were informed that a  
father had threatened to harm his  
daughter and had possibly violated  
a Family Court order of protection.  
Subsequently, the father injured  
the child. The police department  
was found to be negligent by not  
taking the father into custody or  
otherwise preventing the assault.  
The Court held that a “special  
relationship had been created..."  

Sorichetti et al v. NYC  
(July 9, 1985)  

DAMAGE TO CHILD AFTER BIRTH  

Contention on behalf of totally  
blind, 14-year-old plaintiff,  
is that her disease, which caused  
the blindness, was the result of  
too much oxygen administered by  
hospital personnel during the  
first 13 days of her life. The  
Appellate Division has directed  
that a new trial be held based  
upon a lack of informed consent.  

Flores v. Flushing Hospital  
and Medical Center et al.  
(June 25, 1985)  

SURVIVING SPOUSE GETS ALL  

A husband and wife own a resi-  
dence as tenants by the entirety.  
(This means that if one of them  
dies, the other party receives  
entire interest in the property.)  
In accordance with their separa-  
tion agreement, it was agreed  
that they would sell the resi-  
dence within a specified period  
of time. The wife died before the  
divorce became final and before  
the sale of the home could be com-  
pleted. The Court determined that  
the husband should get the entire  
proceeds since the separation  
agreement did not change the status  
from tenancy by the entirety to  
tenants in common.  

Matter of Violi  
(July 2, 1985)  

DOCTOR NOT NEGLIGENT IN DEATH  

An obstetrician was found  
blameless by the NYS Court of  
Appeals in the death of a 16-week  
old fetus. It was alleged that  
the doctor was negligent in  
performing the amniocentesis  
procedure on the mother's womb.  
A 4-2 decision of the Court,  
utilizing case law on prenatal  
wrongs, determined that there  
was "no duty running from the  
doctor to the mother." Thus,  
under New York Law, the doctor  
could not be held liable for the  
death.
