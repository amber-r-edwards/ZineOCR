February is Black History  
month, recognizing an area of  
American experience long bereft  
of adequate attention. Black  
women, however, doubly oppressed  
in our white male-dominated so-  
ciety, have received practically  
no attention for their contri-  
butions.  

Offered here is a list of  
Black women's contributions and  
"firsts" we can remember not only  
in February, but throughout the  
year. This list is a sampling,  
and does not pretend to be com-  
prehensive. A reference list is  
included for a more complete view  
of the experience of the Black  
woman. Particularly worthy of  
note in this list is Sage: A  
Scholarly Journal on Black Women,  
founded in 1984, and the only  
such journal of its kind. Pub-  
lished twice yearly by the Sage  
Women's Educational Press, Sage  
focuses on one aspect of Black  
women's lives in each issue.  
Future issues planned include  
“Black Women as Workers,” "Black  
Women in the Diaspora," and  
"Black Women as Artists and  
Artisans."

The Collective  
-Meets...  

Born to make  

often lack the  
those major, last-minute  
changes in CG's entire layout even  
though we know it would improve the  
paper.  

In addition to consolidated lay-  
outs, late arrivals and exhaustion  
affecting placement, we have also  
developed a policy on regular col-  
umns that affects where some arti-  
cles are placed. We are fortunate  
to be able to count on our regular  
columnists for continuing themes,  
topics or viewpoints, and we have  
tried to develop a consistent place-  
ment for them to enhance reader  
appeal. Announcements and resource  
items, both heavily read and a key  
focus of OS, are placed toward the  
back where our monthly columnists  
are also featured. We believe this  
creates a good balance between the  
need for variety and change in the  
front pages that attracts new reader-  
ship, and the importance of main-  
taining a coherent and somewhat  
predictable format that allows the  
steady readership to know where key  
revealing features are located.  

Just a few words more on "mechanics."  
Proofreading is a subject upon which  
we've been called to task several  
times by writers. Yes, Virginia, we  
do use dictionaries, and we admit  
that we're going to plead guilty  
with extenuating circumstances:  
“womanpower shortfall.” As our small  
group sings on late into Sunday even-  
ing to ready the pages for the printer,  

1 or 2 with us  
and not only will you earn our  
undying gratitude, but you will enjoy  
the paper which arrives beautifully  
printed in your mailbox even more.  

With our present guilty cadre,  
we double our efforts to search for and  
destroy typos. (We understand the  
BN made the same resolution this year!)  
On the less mechanical and more  
spiritual side of CG, we have received  
excellent feedback on the "theme" ap-  
proach that we tried this past year,  
such as December's "Women and Reli-  
gion" and our annual "Women and Arts"  
issue. Our current plan is to run  
about four "theme" publications per  
year to be able to both explore topics  
common to many of us in more depth,  
and increase our commitment to reaching  
out to a more diverse group of women  
contributors. We're proud to announce  
that “Woman's Press," our women and the  
arts issue, will be published in April  
this year (see the call for material  
in this issue). We are also giving  
early notice that we are looking for-  
ward to an issue on “Women and Fit-  
ness" this summer, and another on  
“Women and Children" this fall. As  
always, we hope for submissions from  
women with a variety of approaches to  
each theme to reflect the diverse na-  
ture of our women's community. Most  
of OS's writers are not professional  
authors - they are women with some-  
thing to share. Please consider  
sharing your thoughts in our summer  
and fall issues.  

And now for the subject we speak  
most consistently about in this column:  
Our Finances. Like most small busi-  
nesses, both profit and not-for-profit,  
struggling through these economic  
times makes for shaky fiscal conti-  
tions. Our subscription and adver-  
tising increases have actually increased  
this past year, but not enough as yet  
to offset projected cost increases  
due to inflation and other factors.  
The appropriate analogy is not that  
you are joining a sinking ship in  
contributing your money, time, or  
effort to CG, but that you are be-  
coming part of a women's group that  
is committed to survive.  

Although every decision we make  
may not be the right one in your  
eyes - you may be more interested  
in a poetry review than an article  
on women and fat liberation - we  
believe that we are living up to  
our commitment to reflect the di-  
versity and interests of our wo-  
men's community as a whole. This  
does not mean we are striving for a  
bland, banal, middle-of-the-road  
policy on anything from article
