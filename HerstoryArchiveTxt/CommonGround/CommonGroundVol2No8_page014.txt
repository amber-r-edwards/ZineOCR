VIEWS ON TV

by Susan Clements

Throughout this particularly cold  
winter, I've spent a good deal of time  
parked in front of the boob tube, and  

feel bound to comment on several things  

I've seen, since the TV commentary in  
the Buffalo News has carried a deci-  
dedly misogynist slant of late.  

March brought the return of "Cagney  
& Lacey", an excellent police-adven-  
ture series starring Tyne Daly and  
Sharon Gless as female detectives.  
Many women I know were glued to the  
TV set for the return of this series.  
This wonderful show has been cancelled  
twice due to anemic Nielsen ratings.  
Extraordinary viewer response actu-  
ally brought response from the network.  
It seems that people are interested  
in shows with strong women characters.  
It is heartening, in the age of such  
cheesecake-laden drivel as “We've  
Got It Made", to see a series where  
women act like real people, and where  
female friendship is not trivialized.  
"Cagney & Lacey" can be seen on CBS,

"St. Elsewhere" has recently been  
dealing sensitively with the issue of  
rape. In the last few shows, a series  
of rapes terrorized the hospital's  
staff and patients. Before the rapist,  
a resident doctor whom everyone knew,  
was caught, the women became justifi-  
ably frightened and suspicious of the  
men that they worked with. The men  
responded by becoming defensive. The  
hospital's efforts to provide protec-  
tion and rape prevention education  
for the women resulted in a lot of  
anger. I think the writers have done  
a good job showing the anxiety that a  
series of rapes produces for a group  
of people that work together.  

Once the rapist was caught, anger  
intensified, and the rapist's friends  
were ostracized. As often happens in  
real life, the suspect was released  
and allowed to return to work pending  
trial. This made the women feel en-  
raged and helpless. "St. Elsewhere"  
is a worthwhile show to watch.  

Commercial Hit List:  
Sometimes commercials can be the  
worst instances of blatant sexism on  
TV. This month's worst offender is  
an ad for Hills Brothers Hot Chocolate  
Mix, where tiny tots having a tea  
party echo the grown-up commercials.  
"How come he never asks for my hot  
chocolate?" a little girl asks another  
mini-wife in training, Ugh! There's  
nothing like getting a head start on  
the next generation.

kibbitzer.

On February 26 at MC Compton's  
an audience of about 90 people were  
treated to an evening of poetry to  
music by three local performers--  
Compton's Jill Kurek on keyboard and  
bass, Poet Melissa Ragona and new-  
comer Teresa Taylor and her poems.  
"Voices of Women" is fast becoming  
a well-respected forum for local  
talented women. EMMA, which spon-  
sors "Voices" is planning several  
events throughout 1984-5,

Said the Niagara  

The January wind roars down  
from Georgian Bay  
raking my waters  
with its iron teeth.  
Part of my  
self  

stiffens  

still as death,  
while underneath  
the fish and flowers feed  
within the folds  
of my hidden flow.  

When the wind turns sweet  
and loosens the cold-boned crust  
on my back,  
I say,  
"Come,  
my other self.  
Be one with me again.  
For in me -  
the life-blood  
of the Mother -  
all things are reborn.  
In the warmth  
of my ever-flowing depths  
you will find  
yourself,  

and be free."
