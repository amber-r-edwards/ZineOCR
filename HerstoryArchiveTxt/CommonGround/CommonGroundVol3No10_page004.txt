UNITED NATIONS WORLD CONFERENCE
IN NAIROBI, KENYA
by Sharon Green

Ten years ago, at the United
Nations International Women's Year
World Conference in Mexico City, the
U.N. Decade for Women was declared.
Five years later, in 1980, an international
conference for women was held in Copenhagen,
and on July 15 - 26 the final meeting will be held
in Nairobi, Kenya.

The themes for the decade have

been "Equality, Development and Peace"

and the main task of the Nairobi
Conference is to review and appraise
the achievements of this decade for
women. Also, the non-governmental
Organization of the U.N. will hold
a forum in Nairobi from July 10 -
19, which will focus more specifically
on the issues of equality,
development, peace, education, health,
and employment for women.

Because it is important for women
to be acknowledged as active in
international affairs, we encourage

CG readers to remind The Buffalo News
to give the July conference in Nairobi

sufficient and accurate coverage.
This can be done by writing letters

to Editor Murray Light c/o The Buffalo

News, One News Plaza, Buffalo, NY
14240. Letters or calls should also
be made to local radio and TV
stations, as well as other newspapers
and magazines.

Finally, CG would like very much
to include some coverage of this very
important women's event. However,
so far we have been unable to locate
anyone in the WNY area who will be
attending. If any CG readers know
of someone who will be there and who
might be interested in writing their
reactions and observations, please
send name and address to CG, P.O.

Box 313, Bidwell Sta., Buffalo, NY
14222 attn: Sharon Green, or leave
a message at 881-4383.

Director at Shippensburg State University
(1980-1983). She was a former Human
Rights Commissioner for the State
of Pennsylvania, served on the editorial
board of Social Policy magazine, the National
Advisory Board of the American Civil Liberties
Union, the National Women's Political
Caucus, the Corporation for Public
Broadcasting, and the National Board of the
Coalition for Human Needs and Budget Priorities. She
was an invited guest of the Swedish
government's program "Opinion Builders."

During her lifetime Dr. Heide
actively demonstrated intellect,
force, caring, and commitment
articulating the women's
imperatives for society!
In her writing and her public
speaking, she was described as “outrageous,
witty," "compelling," “a gentle re-
volutionary,"” "brilliant humorist,"
“sensitively articulate." A partial
list of her titles illustrates
her radical perspective and wit:

Feminist Menopause

Security,

Masculism - Beyond Ball

Two books
scope and
and work are scheduled
for publication in the Fall of 1985 to
Daughters, Inc., P.O. Box 70, Buffalo
New York 14222. Both books were in
press at the time of her death, and
her daughters have requested that
memorial gifts be sent to Margaret-

daughters to assist with the

cost of publication. Dr. Heide's

Feminism for the Health of It weaves
together her unique humor, her cre-
ations of new words, and astute
analyses of a broad range of social
and political issues including
scholarship, economics, medicalization
of health care, communications
and the media, and international
policy. A Feminist Legacy: The
Ethics of Wilma Scott Heide by
ethicist Eleanor Humes Haney in-
cludes a biography of Wilma's life,
a history of NOW just prior to and
during Wilma's Presidency, and a
study of feminist ethics that emerged
from Wilma's life and work.

INCITER

(NOTE: Common Ground is sorry to
announce in this issue the demise
of yet two more feminist publications. In addition to the Lesbian
Inciter, described in this letter,
New Women's Times, out of Rochester,
New York, has also ceased publication. New Women's Times had
published for ten years, and gave CG
a good deal of help and advice

when this paper first started about
three years ago. We hope to run

a more complete article on the
issues surrounding their decision
in a future issue.) +

Dear Friends:

We are sad to announce that
another Lesbian space is gone.
The Lesbian Inciter collective
published its last issue--no. 14
in February. The present collective
does not wish to continue to
publish the paper. Instead of
letting the paper die, we'd like
to find other Lesbians who would
be willing to take it on. This
letter is to request that you or
other Dykes take on the Inciter.

We would like whoever takes on
the Inciter to follow our most
basic policy of being a paper by
and for Lesbians only. Also,
please refer to our policy circle
(any issue, page 2). We'd like to
find a group that agrees with the
gist of our other policies as well.

What we have to offer is our
computerized subscription list,
interested new subscribers, back
issues, selections, review books,
and envelopes. We also currently
have $400, and accounts payable
from bookstores. We'd like to
pass on some seed money, but at
this time aren't sure what we will
have left to offer.

LETTERS

ANTI-RACIST

Dear Common Ground:
The following piece was written
by my friend Susan Wiseheart in
Grand Rapids, Michigan. It appears
in the first issue of an anti-racist
white women's newsletter. This
newsletter is a space for white
women (specifically; not exclusively)
to network and support each
other in our opposition to racism
in ourselves and in the world.

People of color may also read and
share this newsletter, as you have
your arts and words to us.
Copies of the newsletter are available

and are welcome.

I am aware that racism is unique to
me, that it means I am,
constantly
into the com-
fortable privilege. I must remind myself

and others that in the U.S.
racism directly adversely affects all
peoples of color from all heritages
and that there are many such heritages here; African, Asian, Hispanic, and Native American Indian. I
must school myself about all races
and cultures, admit to the genocidal
and slave-holding propensities
of my race, search out reasons to
feel good about my whiteness (abolitionist women, witches, a handful
of admirable whites.) I must, in
short, root out and challenge daily,
consistently, with fervor and commitment, my own racist assumptions
and beliefs which have been instilled
in me by decades of living in a
racist society.

At the same time, I must search
out and be cognizant of those things
in people with whom I relate--
family, friends, co-workers, acquaintances--and be ever on the
lookout for new and innovative ways
to effectively confront them in
those with whom I have influence.
And this is only a beginning. It
involves reminding everyone I know
that we are a multi-racial society.
It includes presenting the extremely
elusive (because so ingrained and
accepted by all) damages done to
white people as well as peoples
of color by racism in such a clear
and unmistakable way that other
whites (and I) feel it in the
depths of our beings, know it for
the disease it is, see the value in
eradicating it from ourselves and the
world around us. And this is just
to do with attitudes and with beliefs. They are the barest tip of
the mammoth iceberg of racism's
influence, these personally held
convictions that then go on to
shape the institutions which pervade
and control our lives.

Next and at the same time, imperfect as my attempts so far have
been at becoming unracist and ongoing as they must continue to be,

I must challenge institutional
racism. Behaviors, policies, and
procedures of institutions and
those who comprise them are what
make up the stuff of our lives.
Whites own and control them all in
the U.S. From government to religion
to housing to education and
economics, the systems are run by
whites. True, there are sometimes
peoples of color in seemingly
decision-making places within them
but, in essence, the final say is

with white men. White women,
though, by virtue of our skins and
blood ties, are accorded privilege
not given to any person of color,
simply on the basis of our whiteness. So another aspect of my work
as an anti-racist is to pit myself
against institutional racism. The

first step is to learn it backwards,
forwards, and inside out, to know
how it manifests, even

never
also means
using

and learning

cards, workshops,

parades,

alternative

readings, confrontations,
new programs, phone calls, badgering
officials, doing in-depth audits
of institutions, publicizing facts,
educating, being aligned with and
in coalition with organizations
fighting for the elimination of
racism. These are just a few of
the possibilities. This newsletter
is part of it. Reading the books

on the lists is part of it. And
never giving up, never stopping,
never allowing myself to sit back,
rest, or quit. Because that is all
too easy to do when I am white.

Too easy to get focused, as I did
at the '84 Festival, on other work,
and to "forget" about racism, too
easy to wait for a woman of color
(again) to remind me. Too easy

to ignore it, let it pass me by,
because it does not go for my vitals
with direct deep wounds, only corrodes
and eats away slowly and insidiously and, if I choose it to
be so, nearly unnoticed. Or noticed
and shrugged off with the old help-
less-guilt immobility. So being
anti-racist also means working to
be vigilant, awake, conscious, com-
mitted, and consistently so.

Then, besides addressing personal
and institutional white racism, I
have (we have) the task of simul-
taneously working to eradicate all
the other -isms that oppress me
(us) or anyone we care about.

White racism does not exist as an
isolated phenomenon. Classism,
ageism, anti-semitism, sexism,
heterosexism, ableism, colorism,
militarism, witch-hunting, etc. are
all parts of the whole of oppression
that saps away the vitality and
creativity of millions of earth's
people for the seeming benefit of
a few. (I question the real benefit
of life at the cost of others'
lives or well-being.) I must abhor
and struggle against all the -isms,
the ones that victimize me and

the ones where I am part of the
oppressing group. If this world
would become as I would have it;
safe, healthy, and life-affirming
for all, I have no other choice.

To me, being anti-racist means
keeping all of the many-faceted
aspects of oppression in my con-
sciousness constantly too, and,
while sometimes focusing my work

in a particular direction, never
allowing my anti-ableist work to
be racist, for example, or my anti-
militarist work to be anti-semitic.
None of it is easy. Often I must
forgive myself for not doing well
enough and then go on to try and
do better. It's difficult, puzzling,
conflicting, complex, and dangerous
work, and absolutely necessary.
