BLACK FEMINIST  
SPEAKS OUT  

The most important task of the wo-  
men's movement today is the defeat of  
Ronald Reagan in 1984. The second  
most important task is the raising of  
the consciousness level of working  
class women! One task cannot be ac-  
complished without the other!  

The politicizing of working class  
women is the most imperative task in  
the feminist agenda. We must ask  
ourselves why are working class eth-  
nic white, Black and Hispanic women  
conspicuous by their absence in the  
feminist movement? Has the feminist  
agenda clearly understood and clearly  
addressed those issues relevant to  
working class women? Have we clearly  
understood that capitalism, and in  
many cases trade union enforced  
division of labor has wrecked havoc  
upon the pay scales and working con-  
ditions of women, Blacks and Hispan-  
ics? Not only are most corporate  
executives male but all decision  
makers in the trade unions are  
also males!  

We must be careful not to trade  
feminism for Kirklandism. The dis-  
astrous policies of the 1980's un-  
der Reaganism have led to the "femin-  
ization of poverty!" Our struggle  
must usher in the 1990's with the  

"feminization of power!"  

To seize power must become our  
goal. To seize power by any and all  
lawful means necessary! We must  
organize and radicalize working class  
women, the unemployed, the poor, the  
handicapped, the welfare mothers, for  
through them, the dispossessed, lies  
the path to power.  

Radicalize! Radicalize! and teach  
the class struggle. Reagonomics is  
not only a declaration of war upon  
women, but Reagonomics is waging class  

warfare upon the entire American  
working class! Our task is therefore  
clear: the defeat of Reaganism is our  
number one priority! Our ultimate  
goal is the "feminization of power!"  
We have the expertise, we have the  
numbers, we have the anger, we must  
develop the determination! It can  
be done! It will be done! We will  
no longer be the silent breeders of  
sons to be slaughtered in wars against  
the sons of other poor mothers! We  
will no longer be the silent sewers  
to receive the wastes of pornographic  
male sexuality! We will no longer  
be the silent slaves in the offices  
and factories supporting by our  
sweated labor, for semi-subsistence  
wages, an oligarchy of insensitive  
Anglo-Saxon elite males!  

We will be heard! We will seize  
power! Power! Power! to the daughters  
of the working class!

LETTERS  

Dear Common Ground:  

I want to comment or really,  
rather, express puzzlement about a  
seeming contradiction in feminism to-  
day. I thought early on in the move-  
ment's crystallization in the 60's that  
it was generally resolved to avoid  
the "star" system. Today we see  
spokeswomen for feminism who seem  
sometimes to be our only voice -  
having some theory to voice or even  
copyright. I thought these women just  
spoke for themselves, adding insights,  
but that most feminist thought evol-  
ved from group consciousness. You  
see, I find that oppressive - and an  
imitation of male history - where  
individuals are "credited," and ego has  
a lot at stake in breakthroughs. To  
me that actually limits and inhibits  
the possibility of breakthroughs for  
feminism and real change for women as  
a whole.  

Instead, we watch “stars" emerge  
or ascend, while the great number of  
women are left in a morass of sorts.  
Are we just supposed to admire the  
"stars"?  

I thought we were all fallen stars,  
from a time when women as a whole  
had more say and authority in society.  
I thought we all rise, or none of us  
has risen very far.  

I guess I am doubly oppressed in  
my feelings: In my family the boys  
were the “stars". Always, they were  
the greatest, the smartest, etc. I  
might have done better than my broth-  
ers and cousins in grade school,  
high school, or undergraduate work,  
but they are the ones recognized by  
the family - making 10 times as much  
income as I, considered the "stars".  
(I am sort of a clod on the ground  
below, by comparison, according to  
family values) i.e., rather hopeless.  

I turn to feminism - hoping to  
restore my esteem, my sense of worth  
as a woman person.  

Instead I find “stars" and the  
rest of us (groupies?) who I guess  
are just supposed to be autograph  

seekers, and in awe of feminist "gu-  
rus" of the movement, I gather.  

I find it rather depressing act-  
ually. My brothers and cousins were  
“built up" all their lives to the  
point where they think they are  
gods, while I have been torn down,  
put down, put in "my place" with such  
grim regularity, I shudder to think  
of the psychic toll it has had on  
me.  

I come to feminism and find high-  
priestesses, and I suppose I'm  
supposed to be a "true believer" -  
but I believe each person in life  
can be privy to part of the answers.  
I guess I really think a healthy  
women's movement with real grassroots,  
and elitism don't mix very well.  

My thoughts on the situation -  
Joan Van De Water

Utility Problems?  

The New York State Public Service  
Commission's Consumer Services Divi-  
sion is available if you have a com-  
plaint about utility service, billing,  
or if you have been threatened with  
cut-off of services.  

The CSD was established to strength-  
en and expand consumer services at the  
Commission. It has a consumer com-  
plaint resolution unit, a Statewide  
outreach and education program, and  
a policy staff to address consumer  
concerns.  

It is responsible for pro-  
tecting consumer rights, which include  
having utility companies obey strict  
rules with regard to termination of  
service, budget plans, the use of de-  
ferred payment agreements to help  
consumers pay their bills, and similar  
actions.  

According to Lisa Rosenblum,  
Director of the Division, the CSD is,  
"...Here to make the Public Service  
Commission more responsive to consum-  
ers, to provide an independent review  
of complaints, to expedite treatment,  
to inform utility consumers about  
their rights through our broad out-  
reach program, and when billing prob-  
lems exist, to help keep service on  
until appropriate arrangements can be  
made."  

When you call the CSD, it will  
initiate an investigation of your  
problem. "If we're dealing with a  
billing complaint, we review appro-  
priate billing files," said Rosenblum.  
"If a discrepancy is found, we send  
a field representative to a residence  
to check the meter for accuracy."

consumers to call in Buffalo and the  
Western New York Region are: gas,  
water, electricity complaints -
