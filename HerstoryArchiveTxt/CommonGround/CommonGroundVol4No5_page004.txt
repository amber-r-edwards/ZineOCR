Female executives are earning  
less now than two years ago and  
20% less than male executives,  
according to a study released by  
a California State University  
professor, Dr. James Boulaarides.  
He said that there were no sig-  
nificant differences in tests of  
572 male and female executives in  
talents or abilities. The pro-  
fessions included banking, busi-  
ness, education, law, industry  
and retail.  

"Female executives are actually  
worse off now than they were two  
years ago. Based upon performance,  
there should be no salary difference."  
He found there had been a drop of  
5% from a similar study conducted  
two years ago, “But the gain is  
not as great at the managerial level  
as it is down at the worker level.”  
Female executives make 80% of  
male executive salaries and working  
women earn 60% as much as their  
male counterparts.  

President Christos Sartzetakis  
recently announced that Greek women  
should help the nation confront a  
military threat from Turkey by  
having more babies. The country's  
five largest feminist organizations  
issued a joint announcement stating  
"Women are not child manufacturing  
machines which must give birth  
to soldiers for war....It is the  
unchallenged right of a woman alone  
to decide whether she will have  
children, how many and when, and  
this right cannot be ignored in  
favor of any national interest or  
other excuse."  

Sartzetakis also expressed op-  
position to abortion stating, "As  
a nation we must encourage more  
births because by the year 2000  
Turks will number 85 million and  
we Greeks only 12 million.” Greek-  
Turkish enmity dates back to the  
Ottoman Empire and was reinforced  
by the July 1974 Turkish invasion  
of Cyprus.  

When called on by the feminist  
groups to receive their delegation  
and issue a clarification and apology  
for his comments, the President's  
spokesman said, "I can't make any  
comment on this issue. But it would  
be ridiculous to accuse the Presi-  
dent of being a sexist.”  

State Sen. Ralph Marino and  
Assemblyman Frederick Schmidt  
have proposed legislation that  
all people applying for marriage  
licenses be tested for the AIDS  
Virus. The testing can only  
scan for antibodies that result  
from exposure to the virus. These  
tests present problems, for a  
positive result does not mean  
a person will get AIDS. Researchers  
say 10% to 20% of these may some-  
day develop the disease.  

Negative results are not clear,  
because antibodies take months to  
form and some AIDS victims die  
without ever developing antibodies.  
It can take six months or longer  
to develop antibodies after ex-  
posure to the virus.  

A national panel of academic,  
business and government experts  
have recommended that parents of  
newborns or newly adopted infants  
be allowed to take a minimum of  
6 months off from their jobs.  

They said that 3 months of this  
time should be paid and warned that  
otherwise the family is in danger  
of losing its central function.  
According to the Bureau of Labor  
Statistics, almost 50% of women  
with children under the age of 1  
are working.  

Members of the Yale University  
Bush Center Advisory Board on  
Infant Care Leave say such leaves  
would be a first step to relieve  
stress on such families and  
strengthen them. They noted that  
two-thirds of all the nations in  
the world, including 81 Third  
World nations, have some provisions  
for parents of infants.  

Though the U.S. has a “strong  
sense of individualism," today's  
families are discovering that  
"families can't be entirely self-  
sufficient, they can't both work  
and (successfully) engage in the  
wonderfully rewarding... experience  
of making a new human being."  

The committee recommended that  
fathers or mothers receive 75% of  
their income for 3 months while  
caring for an infant and that  
job benefits such as health in-  
surance should continue. The  
cost of such a policy, funded by  
either employer-employee contri-  
butions or through private insurance  
would be 1.5 billion dollars  
annually. Rep. Patricia Schroeder,  
a Colorado Democrat, has introduced  
a bill that would require 18 weeks  
of unpaid leave be granted to any  
employee who wanted to take care of  
a newborn, newly adopted or seriously  
ill child.  

T. Berry Brazelton, pediatrician,  
researcher and author, said "Young  
parents aren't going to put up with  
this much longer. They are beginning  
to feel very empowered." He warned  
when infants are separated from their  
parents too early, they fail to bond  
with their parents and may not de-  
velop a basic sense of trust.  

Researchers are concerned that  
up to 90% of toxic shock syndrome  
cases are not reported. Statistics  
from the National Center for Di-  
sease Control say that reported  
cases have dropped by more than  
70% since 1980. Officials estimate  
only 10% of cases are now being  
reported. States do not require  
physicians to report these cases.  

Women have erroneously come  
to the conclusion that toxic  
shock is no longer a problem.  

Rely tampons were linked to 71%  
of the 50 toxic shock cases  
reported to the Center for Di-  
sease Control during September  
1980. They have been removed  
from the market, but cases are  
still being reported.  

Recently, a new editor was appointed  
at The Spectrum, the student news-  
paper at U.B. Marie Michiel, a  
Black woman, is the 3rd woman in  
the history of the newspaper to  
serve as editor-in-chief. She is  
also the first Black to hold this  
position.  

Geraldine Ferraro told a 10 nation  
conference on women and the media  
that during her vice-presidential  
campaign the press "seemed to have  
accepted the notion that a woman  
could not be informed about typi-  
cally male topics like foreign  
policy and national security."  

She said, “There is no doubt I was  
held to different standards because  
I was a woman. But if I had to  
single out any particular media  
for criticism, I would single out  
the Murdoch press." (Rupert Mur-  
doch is the publisher of the N.Y.  
Post, the Chicago Sun-Times, the  
Boston Herald and other news-  
papers).  

Other women at the conference  
commented also. Greek Cultural  
Minister and former actress  
Melina Mercouri said, “Every day  
of my life I'm insulted as a  
woman and an actress...They try  
to ridicule me because of my  
clothes, my private life. But  
I haven't let them get me down."  

Nina Kiselove, editor of the  
Moscow-based International Women’s  
Review, did not criticize her  
country's media coverage, but  
commented that women had not yet  
achieved full equality in the  
Soviet Union.  

Yugoslav journalist Tlic Slavenka  
Drakulic angered the Soviet delegate  
by stating that pornography in  
certain cases "functioned as a step  
toward social freedom.”  

The N.Y. State Health Department  
will designate hospitals to pro-  
vide treatment for AIDS patients  
in order to cut high costs for  
care. The program, called Case  
Management System, will have the  
state reimburse hospitals for a  
percentage of their AIDS care  
costs. New York City will be the  
first to take part in the program,  
because “most of the AIDS patients  
outside of the city are in the  
state prison system and will have  
their own programs," Health Depart-  
ment spokesperson Peter Slocum said.  

Medicare currently picks up less  
than 75% of the hospital costs for  
AIDS patients and none of the bills  
for outpatient services.
