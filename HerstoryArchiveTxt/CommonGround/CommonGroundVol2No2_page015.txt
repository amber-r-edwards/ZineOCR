Harriet Ross Tubman  
By Cherin Silverstein  

"Tell my brothers to be always  
watching unto prayer, and when the  
good old ship of Zion comes along,  
to be ready to step aboard" was a  
cryptic message sent by Harriet  
Tubman, the fugitive slave who is  
better known as the "Moses" of her  
people, as she helped over 300  
slaves to freedom. Her cryptic  
messages were never understood by  
anyone except those she intended  
to rescue.  

Born in the 1820s on a planta-  
tion in Maryland, Harriet Ross  
Tubman was not only a fugitive  
slave with a $40,000 reward hanging  
over her head, she was also a Civil  
War scout and nurse as well as a  
rescuer of slaves.  

At the age of 13, Harriet was  
hit in the head with a 2-lb. weight  
by an overseer. The blow frac-  
tured her skull and the pressure  
on her brain caused her to suffer  
from spells of somnolence the rest  
of her life.  

Afraid of being sold out of  
state when her master, Anthony  
Thompson, died in 1849, Harriet  
ran away to Philadelphia. She  
returned to Baltimore, Maryland,  
in December of 1850 to bring her  

sister and two children to  

In 1851 she rescued her brother  
and his family and later that same  
year Harriet brought another party  
of eleven, including another bro-  
ther and his family, to freedom.  
She had planned to rescue her hus-  
band but he had remarried, and  
declined her help.  

In the ten years preceding the  
Civil War Harriet made approxi-  
mately nineteen trips back to  
Maryland, freeing more than 300  
people. Occasionally she worked  
with an anti-slavery group that  
was connected with the Underground  
Railroad. In 1858 or 1859, Harriet  
settled in Auburn, New York, which  
was to remain her home the rest of  
her life.  

A very religious woman, Harriet  
had foreseen the Civil War in a  
vision. After the outbreak of the  
war in 1861, Harriet served as a  
scout and spy for three years in  
South Carolina. She often ob-  
tained military information from  
negroes behind the Confederate  
lines. In 1865, she worked as a  
nurse at a freedman's hospital in  
Fort Monroe, Virginia. When the  
war ended, Harriet began the Har-  
riet Tubman Home for Indigent Aged  
Negroes. The home continued for  
several years after her death.  

Although she could neither read  
nor write, Harriet helped pay for  
her home with the publication of  
the book, "Scenes in the Life of  
Harriet Tubman," (1869) written  

for her by Sarah Hopkins Bradford.  

The book was published by Auburn  
neighbors. Money from another  
book, a revised edition of Mrs.  
Bradford's book, "Harriet, the  
Moses of Her People," (1886)  

helped to support the many black  
children as well as the many aged  
blacks who lived in Harriet's home  
at that time.  

In the late 1860s Harriet began  
her long fight to be compensated  
for her time served in the war.  

Her application was supported by  
many prominent persons, including  
then Secretary of State, William H.  
Seward. Harriet was turned down  
because there were no laws regarding  
compensation to negro slaves.  

In 1879 Harriet again submitted  
a petition asking for $1800 for  
"three years service as nurse and  
cook in the hospitals, and as com-  
mander of several men (8 or 9) and  
as scout during the late War of  
Rebellion." A Senate Committee  
finally recommended $25 a month for  
the rest of her life, but this was  
reduced to $20 before Congress  

finally enacted a private bill.  

Harriet died of pneumonia in  
March of 1913. At ceremonies which  
were addressed by Booker T. Wash-  
ington, a plaque was erected to  
her memory. Harriet Tubman, whose  
parents had "come in chains from  
Africa" died a free woman in Auburn,  
New York.
