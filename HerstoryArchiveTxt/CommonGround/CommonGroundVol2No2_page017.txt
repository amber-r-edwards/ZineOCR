SIMPLE GIFTS  
CLOSING:

Community  

Analysis  

By Bridget Radford  

On June 24th, I was fortunate to  
attend Sisterfire in Tacoma Park,  
Maryland. Sisterfire is a one day  
festival of women in the performing  
arts sponsored by Roadwork, a pro-  
duction company based in D.C. Two  
words readily jump into my head to  
describe this incredible event--  
"Oh, Wow!".  

Last year between 2,000 and 3,000  
women attended. This year over 6,000  
women came to celebrate 7 hours of  
music and fine women. With some  
changes in the placement of the sta-  
ges even more women could be accom-  
modated next year. And there will  
definitely be a next year!  

Our group of six (MC, Griz, Anna,  
Mary, Sandy and yours truly) spread  
out our blanket, situated our  
miscellaneous belongings and checked  
out the scene. Anna and I were tossing  
the old softball around when the  
lively African beat from Women from  
the Calabash brought the crowd to  
their feet. Sisterfire '83 had begun.  

There were two stages plus street  
performers. On the music stage we  
were entertained by Women of the  
Calabash, Ronnie Gilbert, Toshi Reagon,  
Elizabeth Cotton, Orquesta Sabrosita,  
Linda Tillery, Teresa Trull, Cathy  
Fink, Meg Christian and Sweet  
Honey in the Rock. The second stage,  
called the Cove, was the setting for  
other performing artists such as  
Ella Mae Lentz, Flamboyant Ladies,  
Mischief & Jo Carson.  

For me there were three highlights  
(in addition to being surrounded by  
such a fantastic group of women).  
The first was Elizabeth Cotton, es-  
pecially when her great-granddaughter  
came on stage to sing. The second  
highlight was a newly written, never  
before performed song by Meg Chris-  
tian called “Happy Birthday to You".  

The third was a music workshop by  
Sweet Honey in the Rock. For those  
of you who have never heard of Toshi  
Reagon, I highly recommend her,  
especially if you like Rock 'n Roll.  

A word of caution for those who  
want to attend next year: the weather  
is very hot and there's little shade  
to be found. Refreshments are  
available as well as showers. It's  
a good idea to bring a jug of water  
and a good sun screen, watch your  
neighbor and in time (if you labor)  
you will find all the faults  
you have in mind.

Dear Common Ground:  

Thank you for taking me and the  
issue (the nuclear arms race) ser-  
iously enough to wade through a lot  
of verbiage to get an interview out  
of it for the September Common Ground.  

I want to clear up two points  
about my personal concern.  

One, was that I became shocked as  
I did a lot of homework in prepar-  
ation (I was co-chair) for a YWCA  
luncheon on peace issues. I did  
not merely attend one, but spent  
months sending for material from

those of Simple Gifts. However,  
I immediately began checking  
because they provided vitally  
needed services for battered  
women, support groups, crisis lines,  
community centers, anti-rape task  
forces, women's studies programs,  
or newspapers will be lost.  

In turn, the visibility and in-  
ternal support of the women's move-  
ment as a whole will be dramatically  
decreased. Women cannot afford to be  
complacent. We know what our needs are  
and are in the best position to di-  
rect programs to serve those needs.  
We must not expect the professional  
model of social services to meet  
all our needs--they cannot be  
expected to create social change. That  
is not the way they are set up.  

The issue of women-battering will  
remain unresolved, the problem  
will not go away, unless we change  
the way society operates with re-  
spect to women. Women must make  
strong connections between the  
many programs which seek to im-  
prove women's lives and apply the  
analysis of one problem to the  
others and find the common denom-  
inator. Reform is also not enough,  
however, and it is for this reason  
that alternative programs which are  
seeking real change must be en-  
couraged. Programs which follow  
a feminist model of structure and  
analysis outside of the traditional  
systems can begin to force real  
change.  

What conclusions can be drawn from  
this situation? The politics of  
funding--which rewards traditionally  
structured and psychotherapeutically  
focused agencies in preference to  
other alternative, but effective,  
programs, was one factor that led to  
Simple Gifts' demise. Another was the  
general competition of pro-  
fessionally staffed service programs  
diverting the already limited com-  
munity interest away from Simple  
Gifts.  

As feminists, we view this situ-  
ation as dangerous in a number of  
ways. Simple Gifts was more than  
just another shelter. It was the  
alternative structure and philosophy  
that helped promote social change.  
Without these feminist alternatives--  
a battered women's shelter, a book-  
store, women's studies program, a  
newspaper-- issues are not kept de-  
batable, not brought up for recog-  
nition and discussion, and are not  
dealt with by community members  
(women's community, and larger  
community) in a society-wide con-  
text. The "System" assumes you can  
fix a problem by dealing with the  
specific individuals involved, or  
by coping with the results of prob-  
lems. Feminism looks at the issues  
more holistically.  

Women cannot rely on agencies  
with traditional methods to serve  
the victims of violence against women.  
People who work within the system can  
be feminist, but that is not enough.  
The system itself is, and will con-  
tinue to be, male-identified.
