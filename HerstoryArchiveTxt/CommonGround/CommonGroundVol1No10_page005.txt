Self Defense Collective.]

Self-defense is a women's issue.

It is important for women to learn
basic techniques to defend themselves
in dangerous situations. Self-defense
is also a feminist issue. Women in our
society tend to be seen as victims,
passive and powerless. We are not
only viewed this way by men, but often
we are taught to see ourselves as weak
and helpless. Learning the techniques
of self-defense is one way to combat
this—both in the way we are seen and
the way we see ourselves.

This is the philosophy of Nyu Li Tao
(New-Lee-Dow), the Buffalo Women's
Self Defense Collective. The collective
is an outgrowth of the Nyu Li Tao,
(literally "the way of women's
strength") martial arts school of
Buffalo which closed in about 1979.
Students in this school decided to
join together in a collective, to
adopt the style of the school and
offer practical courses in self de-
fense to women in the community.

What is taught in these courses
should not be confused with tradition-
al offerings of martial arts, however.
In covering basic techniques, for
instance, martial arts prohibits hit-
ting "below the belt" and puts more
emphasis on the correct form in ex-
ercises. The collective, on the other
hand, emphasizes effective blows to
all vulnerable areas, and puts more
emphasis on how to respond in
practical situations than the form.

It is not technique only, but
attitude which is discussed and prac-
ticed. Women in these courses begin
to learn to see themselves capable
of self-defense. Readings (see
Resource Directory in the back of
this paper) are used to help women
talk about their fears, and to turn
their fears into anger. Women often
start the course thinking “I should
go along with what an attacker wants."
This attitude generally changes to
"[An attacker] has no right to take
advantage of me—I refuse to let this
happen.” Women are encouraged to
concentrate on this feeling and use it
to their advantage.

related to injury; however, most
injuries were not serious, and

victims of completed rapes were
more seriously injured than those
who got away. Those victims who
were subjected to extreme violence
were those who resisted slightly or
passively, or resisted during the
act of intercourse. However, offen-
ders believed that they would have
been deterred if the victim had
resisted more vigorously physically
and verbally.

The overall conclusions of the
study, then, point to the fact that
there are no guaranteed best methods
of self-protection. It appears that
vigorous resistance is the most
successful rape prevention tactic,
yet it is also more likely to incur
greater risk of injury. Women must
make their own choices, but it seems
that two basic strategies are essen-
tial:

1. Awareness and preparedness.
The best way to resist rape is to
prevent a potential rape from becom-
ing an actual attack. The existence
of a typical "warm-up" period to a
rape, plus the selection process en-
gaged in by many rapists, suggests
that suspiciousness, trusting our

own intuitive reactions and generally
assertive and confident behavior may
prevent women from being perceived

as likely targets in the first place.
To do this, we must first acknowledge
that rape can happen to us, and begin
to be attentive to our surroundings
when we are out alone. We must also
be willing to take whatever action
is necessary, from refusing to engage
in conversation with a stranger, to
crossing a street to avoid a crowd.

Nyu Li Tao is the only group,

(as far as the collective knows) in
Buffalo which teaches all women's
courses, and which teaches only women.
Far from being anti-male, the all-
female collective has found that

women teach women self-defense more
effectively than men do, especially
since the focus of the course is

to help women prevent attacks. Men
often do not realize that the realism,
and power women feel when they learn
self-defense, is an emotionally
charged situation. Many male teachers
also do not realize it is an internal,
attitude change that makes self-defense
a realistic, practical solution for
women. Many women feel they look

at the world differently than men do,
and this perception must be taken into
account in any self-defense course.
Many women also find male teachers
intimidating, perhaps because male
teachers make assumptions about the
women in their classes which may not
be true.

The women in Nyu Li Tao try to
make no assumptions about their
students. Before they teach how to
punch, for instance, they teach how
to make a fist. Women's bodies also
have different strengths than men's.
Where martial arts taught to men might
emphasize punches, to take advantage
of male upper body strength, women's
self-defense would properly teach more
kicks because of women's lower center
of gravity. Most importantly, women
teaching women provides the students
role models, something the collective
sees as crucial.

Nyu Li Tao also emphasizes that
although they teach women self-defense
so they can better protect themselves,
the fact that a woman does fall
victim to a mugging or rape does
not make it her fault. It is the
attacker's fault. Self-defense
techniques serve to make women less
vulnerable and more confident. Blaming
a victim ignores the fact that only
men rape, whereas focusing on the
issue of women's vulnerability shows
how all women can reduce the risk of
attack.

Nyu Li Tao presently consists of
six collective members, and they give
about three courses (8 sessions each)
a year to the women's community.
Childcare is provided. They will also

of men on a street corner, without
fear that we are “overreacting” or
being rude. For women, a polite and
trusting attitude toward men may be
a luxury we cannot yet afford. We
need to decide, in advance of an
attack, that we are willing to risk
and experience pain or injury to
avoid rape, and that we will stren-
uously resist. Hesitation or ambi-
valence is dangerous.

2. If all else fails, we must
be prepared to respond aggressively.
It is at this point that physical
self-defense techniques can be life-
savers. In addition to teaching us
ways to neutralize an attack, learn-
ing self-defense can make us gener-
ally more self-confident and less
afraid of pain or injury! Yet, in
order to use these tactics, we must
first be clear, in our minds and in
our bodies, that we do not have to
be victims any longer, that we have
as much right to freedom of movement
as any man. It is in our certainty
that we have the right to be free of
sexual threat or abuse and our deter-
mination to vigorously resist any
attempts to limit this freedom, that
our most powerful tools for self-
protection lie.

Chris Dietz has been concerned
with the issue of violence against
women for 10 years. She is a member
of the EMMA collective and is current-
ly researching the relationship be-
tween incest and woman battering.

She also teaches a course on self-
protection for women.

1. Self-Defense is a process consist-
ing of: 1) increasing awareness
about patterns & politics of as-
sault; 2) taking reasonable pre-
cautions to avoid attack; 3) pre-
paring for the possibility of as-
sault not only by learning self-
defense tactics and techniques,
but also by developing the self-
confidence and judgment necessary
to determine appropriate responses
to different attack situations.

2. There are no magic formulas to de-
terring an assailant. Most im-
portant is to have the wherewithal
to be able to assess the situation,
determine the best response, and
then act on it.

3. Women of all ages, ethnicity, edu-
cation and lifestyles are able to
successfully resist attackers.

4. The vast majority of attacks are
planned in advance. Frequently,
an intended victim is watched by
an assailant before he approaches.

5. According to one study, assailants
frequently engaged in a selection
process in choosing victims. Most
assailants selected women they per-
ceived as vulnerable or available.
Physical appearance, assertive body
language, and a wary, suspicious
attitude often led to elimination
as a prospective victim.

6. Frequently, assaults are preceded
by a casual conversation ranging
from two minutes to two hours. Be-
cause these exchanges are 'typically
friendly and impersonal’, women
often respond in a polite and ami-
able way. Despite friendly over-
tones, women who have found them-
selves in these situations have
usually felt uneasy. Those who
were likely to ignore, repress or
rationalize these feelings were
more likely to be attacked.

7. According to Dr. Frank Javorek in
a study conducted with Denver Gen-
eral Hospital Crime Prevention
Unit, women in his study were able
to escape weaponless attackers over
85% of the time if they 1) yelled
to attract attention, and 2) re-
sisted. He found that those women
who did only one of the above, es-
caped over 50% of the time. Women
who did neither rarely escaped.

8. Dr. James Selkin found further,
that in weaponless assaults, the
sooner a woman resisted, the great-
er the likelihood of escape. Wo-
men who bide their time may lose a
strategic advantage in that while
they hesitate, the assailant has
time to check things out to re-
assure himself that help for her
is not nearby.

9. In assaults involving weapons,
biding one's time until an oppor-
tunity to escape presents itself,
i.e., the assailant is momentarily
distracted, is usually a good idea.
The risks involved in resisting an
armed assailant are obviously much
greater than those involved in
weaponless assaults.

10. Research findings suggest that rape
prevention is more possible through

vigorous and aggressive resistance.

Passive resistance (verbal stalling,
slapping, pleading) correlates high-
ly with extreme violence.

Compiled by:
and Karate Association,

Violence occurs in over 80% of all
rape attempts. It's the nature of
the crime in that the primary aim
of the sex offender is the ex-
pression of power, dominance, and
control. Non-resistance doesn't
necessarily insure that violence
won't occur.

Assailants have weaknesses that can
be exploited: he has to get close;
he's afraid of being caught; he
fears and feels pain; he's capable
of being injured.

Most assailants are looking for
victims who will be passive and
cooperative. Aggressive, vigor-
ous victim refusal to be raped
is the most effective resistance
reported by both attempted rape
victims and deterred assailants.

Women who appear to be alert and
suspicious and not overwhelmed by
fear and panic are more likely to
prevent or escape assault. For
instance, in one study none of the

deterred assailants interviewed
perceived their intended victims
as being frightened. Actual de-
fenders claimed that the victim's
fears, i.e., crying, overt nervous-
ness, verbal stalling, encouraged
them to complete the assault.

All women experience fear when
confronted with an assailant.
However, the sooner we can move
past panic and paralysis and fo-
cus on our escape, rather than
the possibility of injury or
death, the more effective our de-
fense will be.

Women are capable of developing
accurate and fast techniques and
using the element of surprise in
an attack to compensate for a po-
tential and relative lack of
strength. Self-defense is not a
sparring match.

Self-defense is a serious, prac-
tical skill that nearly everyone
is capable of learning.

Self-defense is the process of
reclaiming physical integrity
that results, as Py Bateman has
written, in our turning our fears
into anger at intrusions upon
our self-respect.
