A RECIPE FROM THE KITCHEN OF THE BEANSTALK  
SWEET POTATO-CHOCOLATE NUT CAKE  

1/4 tsp nutmeg  

1 tsp salt  

2 cups mashed  

cooked sweet potatoes  

1 1/2 cups oil  

4 eggs  

1 cup chopped nuts  

(Raisins optional)  

4 oz semisweet chocolate  
1 tsp pure vanilla extract  
2 cups flour  
1/2 cup sugar  
1 tsp baking powder  
1 tsp baking soda  

2 tsp cinnamon  

1/2 tsp ground ginger  

1/4 tsp ground cloves  

Butter and lightly flour a 10" tube pan. Place chocolate  
and vanilla in a small saucepan and set, covered in a  
large pan that is filled with boiling water. Sift all dry  
ingredients together & set aside. In another large bowl,  
beat the sweet potatoes with the oil, then beat in the  
eggs one by one until blended. Slowly add dry ingredients  
& mix well, stir in nuts. Put 1/3 of the mixture in an-  
other bowl & stir in the chocolate which will be melted  
by now. Alternate the batters in a tube pan, to get the  
marble effect. With a knife, cut through both batters to  
slightly swirl together. Bake in preheated oven at 350°  
for 1 to 1 1/2 hours or until the sides shrink away from  
the pan & the top springs back to the touch. Let cool 15  
minutes & set on cooling rack.  

SUGAR GLAZE: beat 2 or 3 tablespoons boiling water into  

1 1/2 cups confectioner's sugar until it looks like thick  
cream sauce. Drizzle over the cake.
