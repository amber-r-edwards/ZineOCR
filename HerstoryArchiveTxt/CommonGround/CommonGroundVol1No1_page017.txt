I AM AN ADOPTEE WHO HAS JUST BEGUN TO  
search for my mother. I was born May 20,  
1951 in Our Lady of Victory Homes in  
Lackawanna. I know that my mother would  
now be 55 or 56, and that her maiden  

name was Flynn. She was one of four child-  
ren, and her father was in the lumber  
business in Buffalo. She attended nurs-  
ing school briefly (probably mid 40's)  

and then did secretarial work prior to  

my birth. She was unwed at the time of my  
birth—my father was a Jewish man, in  

real estate and would now be 54-55.  

Since my adoptive parents are both  
deceased, I have almost no family, and  

am most eager to find out if she is alive  
and perhaps even meet her, if she would  
also want to. She can contact me through  
this paper, or through Our Lady of Vic-  
tory Homes. Thank you.

Free Cancer Screening  
at Roswell Park  

Cancer Screening at Roswell Park  
Memorial Institute is open to anyone  
and it's free of charge. To make an  
appointment, call the receptionist  
Monday through Friday at 845-4401.  

You will be sent a medical history  
form to fill out, a hemoccult test kit  
to check for hidden blood in the stool,  
a map of Roswell and confirmation of  
appointment.  

Appointments can be made for morn-  
ings, afternoons and some evenings.  
They will even do "group" exams of  
friends for support.  

The screening takes approximately  
one hour, including waiting time. You  
will get a complete physical exam, and  
special tests: urine, blood pressure,  
pap smear and stool test. They check  
for abnormalities which might indicate  
cancerous or precancerous conditions on  
the skin, head, neck, breasts, genitals,  
colon and rectum.  

They do not diagnose you, but if  
there is an abnormality, they will re-  
fer you to your own physician or one  
at Roswell.  

If cancer seems to run in your fami-  
ly, it would be wise to have a screen-  
ing for your peace of mind.  

For Can-Dial taped cancer infor-  
mation, call 845-3380.  

OMEGA™ is extending its hours of business effec-  
tive September 13, 1982. The store will now be open six days a week, with the  
addition of Mondays, and new store hours will be Monday - Friday, 11am-7pm and  

Saturday 12-5pm. Plans are also in the works for a Saturday morning children's  
story hour. Watch for details!  
September 13-18 the store is holding a "Back to School" sale. All purchases of  
$5.00 or more of books and records will be discounted 10%.  

EMMA is also organizing a mail order purchase service, aimed at serving the rural  
women of Western New York and women with limited access to transportation.  
If you would like your name added to the mailing list for this service, or if you  
would like more information, contact the bookstore.  

The bookstore also invites women to participate in the second annual "EMMA RUN"  
to be held in Delaware Park. This year the run will be co-sponsored with  
Common Ground, and it will take place October 2. To enter, you must have sponsor-  
ship fees totaling $5.00 or more, or pay a $5.00 entry fee. Prizes will be  
given to those women with the most sponsorship dollars. This run has different  
distances to choose from, and is non-competitive. Pick up your entry form at  

the store!  

Plans are in the works for another community event in the fall, with information  
to be published in the bookstore's upcoming newsletter. Many women attended the  
last event which was co-sponsored with other groups,  
reading at Oscar Micheaux Theatre in April, and thoroughly enjoyed it.  
EMMA carries many of the books mentioned in the resource listing in this news-  
journal, and is networking with Common Ground to have these books available.  
Resources available at EMMA will be coded with an
