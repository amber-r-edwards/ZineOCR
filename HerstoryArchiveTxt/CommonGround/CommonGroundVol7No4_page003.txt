Librarians in

by Judith Geer and Ilona Middleton

The New York Library Association  
(NYLA) was created almost 100 years  
ago to promote the needs and  
interests of libraries and  
librarians. Within the structure  
of NYLA are the usual sections and  
committees which are part and  
parcel of most professional  
societies. Also appended to the  
NYLA "animal" are roundtables, or  
smaller, more specific groups  
dedicated to a single issue or  
concern of librarianship. One such  
group, entitled the Roundtable on  
the Concerns of Women (RCW) was  
formed several years ago to examine  
the attributes of an almost  
entirely female profession (85% of  
librarians in the U.S. are women)  
and to address the informational  
needs of our women clients.

NYLA holds an annual conference,  
varying the site to a different  
part of the State each year. The  
1988 conference was held this year  
in Buffalo from October 12th  
through the 16th. Last fall, when  
we officers of RCW began planning  
the programs that we wanted to  
sponsor at the 1988 conference, we  
knew we didn't have to look far.  
Western New York is blessed with a  
plethora of gifted women writers  
and publishers from whom to enlist  
help. We finally settled on two  
presentations, one featuring area  
publishers and one a local writer.

The panel of publishers was  
entitled "Women's Presses: Heading  
Toward the 21st Century.” It was  
held Thursday morning, October 13th  
and featured Bonnie Johnson, one of  
the publishers and editors of  
Earth's Daughters, (CG's own) Beth  
Mann, one of the "founding mothers"  
of Common Ground, and Sara Stauffer  
Whaley, founder of Women's Studies  
Abstracts.

In the course of the  
discussion all three women were  
pointing out that small,  
particularly women's  
presses, furnish a forum for the  
creative expression of women,  
allowing diversity in content and  
the ability to take risks with  
format - something you can't get  
with a big press. Risks are also  
taken when dealing with  
controversial topics. Beth Mann  
revealed that Common Ground was one  
of the first newspapers to print  
articles on AIDS.

Sara Stauffer Whaley stressed  
the need for an abstracting service  
that will document the works of

small amount of misconception;  
misrepresentation and ridicule;

women. All three speakers  
expressed concern over the fact  
that women still have a difficult  
time getting published, hence the  
greater need for the small women's  
press.

The qualities of commitment and  
dedication were especially apparent  
in these women as they recounted  
the enormous amount of time  
entailed in sustaining a small  
press and the constant battle to  
secure funding.

Our second program on Saturday,  
October 15th featured Gabrielle  
Burton, award-winning author of the  
novel HEARTBREAK HOTEL. Ms.  
Burton's talk was in two parts: a  
touching, funny reminiscence of her  
childhood love affair with  
libraries, and the difficulties  
encountered in getting the  

controversial HEARTBREAK HOTEL  
published. Written in  

stream-of-consciousness style and  
inspired by Ms. Burton's feminist  
outlook, HEARTBREAK HOTEL was  
rejected by 28 publishers before  
emerging from over 800 entrants as  
the winner of the Maxwell Perkins  
Award for excellence for a first  
novel. At this point Scribner's  
agreed to publish the work. It has  
since seen publication in Britain  
and recently has been made  
available in paperback.

Ms. Burton revealed that she  
began writing in the early 1970s  
because she wanted to create a  
rational argument in essay form to  
convince her husband that he should  
share housekeeping chores with her.  
Her essay turned out to be 160  
pages long and was eventually  
published as her first book, I'M  
RUNNING AWAY FROM HOME BUT I'M NOT  

Gracious and soft-spoken, Ms.  
Burton was an entertaining,  
thought-provoking speaker and we  
were very happy that over 50  
conference-goers elected to attend  
this program.

We RCW members were indeed  
fortunate to be able to hear from  
these talented women and will most  
certainly benefit professionally  
from their valuable insights. We  
look forward to presenting at least  
two programs with feminist themes  
at future conferences of our  
Association, and feel this is  
something other professions should  
do if they are not already doing  
it. Awareness of the various  
facets of feminism becomes  
increasingly important considering  
the political climate in this  
country.

CALL FOR ACTION!  

I am sure that CG readers were  
appalled at the recent Police  
Department inaction directed by  
Mayor Griffin as a so-called "crowd  
control policy" for Right to Lifers  
blocking the entrance to the  
Avenue Womanservices  

Selective police enforcement -  
in this case, non-enforcement -  
obvious bias in the  

application of the law. The —  

Mayor's consistent declaration of  
Right to Life Day on IWD is  
sufficient proof that his  
interference in police policy is  
motivated by his own particular  
brand of politics. Thus far, only  
Council Member Pitts has seen fit  
to make a strong statement against  
Commissioner Degenhart's "policy,"  

and Degenhart has proudly pointed  
to all the congratulatory  
correspondence he has received that  
supposedly supports his “policy.”  
Since Police Policy in Buffalo  
appears to depend on a "mail vote,"  

the solution is obvious. Direct  
your correspondence to:  
Police Commissioner Ralph  
Degenhart  
74 Franklin Street  
Buffalo, New York 14202  

Pitts, Council President George K.  
Arthur, your District Council  
Member, and optionally the Mayor.  
They can all be reached at Buffalo  
City Hall, 65 Niagara Square,  
Buffalo, N.Y. 14202. It also  
wouldn't hurt to send a letter to  
the Buffalo News.

"Place in the Center" - Angela Davis  

by Yetta Kurland  

"We must place ourselves at the  
center," Angela Davis told the 200  
women who gathered to hear her  
speak in Milwaukee, Wisconsin this  
July for the Second Conference of  
the National Association of Women's  
Centers.

Angela Davis not only  
brilliantly mapped the historical  
progression of the women's  
movement, but gave an encouraging  
and accurate analysis of our  
present state and where we are  
headed, and offered some ideas for  
solutions to some of the problems  
the movement has - and is - facing.

She cautioned women about  
thinking we have "finished the  
job." Often people assume because  
there has been a women's movement  
and a civil rights movement we have  
eliminated racism and sexism. We  
must realize that these movements  
have not ended, and that these  
oppressions have not ended: "We  
haven't won as many victories as we  
may have thought...we still have a  
long, long way to go."

Angela Davis spoke of the  
conflicts that often arise between  
"the old generation, and the new.”  
We must recognize what women before  
us have done: “younger women tend  
to be impatient, and therefore feel  
defeated if it is not possible to  
make the changes they want today or  
tomorrow, but we're talking about  
social change...something of  
enormous magnitude." We must "reap  
the fruit" of the generation before  
us, says Davis, “and then the seeds  

DECEMBER 1988 COMMON GROUND  

may be thrown again, so that they  
also may be reaped when the time is  
ripe."

"There was a lot of racism in  
the movement." Women of color were  
forced to choose between fighting  
for the liberation of women or the  
liberation of people of color.  
"Although there was militancy in  
both movements, we could not work  
together. But now," Davis says,  
"the consciousness is there, but  
consciousness is not all that's  
necessary." We need to use what  
other women have fought to secure  
for us. We need to demand that  
that consciousness be used "to  
create a truly multi-issue women's  
movement, not in spite of our  
differences, but rather,  
acknowledging those differences as a  
creative force."

Davis cautioned women about  
falling into a "politically  
correct" blindness, where “the  
reality surrounding us can directly  
conflict with our 'political  
correctness'...we need to make the  
transformation from theory to  
practice." We need to look at  
ourselves as well as ‘out there,'  
for racism and sexism.

Angela Davis ended her speech  
with an assessment of the women's  
centers in this country. "We have  
not yet incorporated a truly  
multi-racial, multi-issue agenda  
in our women's centers...most  
centers still are racially  
homogeneous." We need to be able  
to create in these centers a safe  
space for all women, not in spite  
of their differences, but from  
their differences.
