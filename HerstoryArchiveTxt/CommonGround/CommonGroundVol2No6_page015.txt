VOICES OF WOMEN  
part one  

It has been a long time since an  
evening of entertainment by and for  
local women has been presented in  
Buffalo, and if this first in EMMA's  
new series called "Voices of Women"  
is any indication, quality perfor-  
mances will be a new regular feature  
for the area.  

A standing room only sing-along  
crowd packed into the performance at  
Church of the Ascension hall to hear  
four different and talented women  
on January 28.  

First on stage was Marnie O'Shae  
in an outrageous red and black get-  
up (in honor of the "Lizard Ball",  
she said), who gave the audience some  
real crowd-pleasing songs, including  
the popular "Engineer Song" written  
by Peggy Seeger. O'Shae has a full,  
throaty voice and a good rapport with  
the audience. Her performance star-  
ted the show off splendidly.  

O'Shae, who performed at some  
other events last year, has also been  
singing with Kathy Moriarty. Mori-  
arty joined O'Shae on stage for some  
rock and roll and close harmonized  
numbers including the Roche sisters’  
“Hammond”. They looked good on stage  
together, and the crowd liked the  
duet.  

Moriarty then had a solo set,  
which continued to show off her  
smooth, versatile voice. She did a  
variety of songs, including the  
oldie John Denver “Eagle and the  
Hawk" and some soft rock. She also  
included a jazz-scat, a Terry  
Garthwaite number, and a new original  
piece. Moriarty has been playing,  
singing and writing locally for a  
number of years, and always gets a  
good crowd and a good audience re-  
sponse to her music.

NEWS  

INCREASE IN INFANT  
MORTALITY RATE  
FOR BLACKS  

"Something is very wrong in New  
York State," said Sara Rosenbaum,  
director of the Child Health Divi-  
sion of the Children's Defense Fund.  
Her statement refers to the fact  
that New York has the worst record  
in the country in the amount of  
medical care available to low-income  
women in the early stages of preg-  
nancy.  

Ms. Rosenbaum said New York State  
has been registering sharp increases  
in the percentages of women who  
receive no pre-natal care or get  
attention late in the pregnancy.  

Of all the 59 states and the District  
of Columbia, New York's 21.3% rate  
for non-white women in the late or  
no-care category was the highest.  

She blames these problems on the  
poor administration of Medicaid, and  
the problem of bureaucratic delay  
resulting from the lack of on-site  
application process.  

A report issued by the Food Research  
and Action Center finds that infant  
mortality among blacks has increased  
9% since 1978. “Black babies are  
more than twice as likely to die in  
the first year of life than white  
babies and are nearly twice as likely  
to be low birth weight babies," said  
the report.  

Ms. Rosenbaum blames the high  
infant death rate on other factors,  
such as Reagan administration budget  
cuts in maternal and infant care  
clinics, removal of 700,000 children  
last year from Medicaid and the Aid  
to Families with Dependent Children  
category of welfare, dropping immun-  
ization rates, with only 10% of black  
children being immunized against  
polio.  

inevitable announcements, handled  
with aplomb by emcee Gerri Bayer),  
another long-time performer, Susan  
Clements, took the stage (although  
she did give it back eventually).  
Clements, after bantering with the  
emcee, gave the audience a perfor-  
mance of "mushy love songs” as she  
put it. The mush, which included "I only  
Want To Be With You" and "The French  
Waltz". For those who tired of  
hearing about perfect love, Clements  
had the audience singing and clapping  
along to a country-western parody,  
“You Done Stomped On My Heart”.  
Clements, who did the local “folk  
circuit" for a while, hasn't done  
much performing lately, and the  
audience made it clear they think  
it has been too long between per-  
formances. She is an excellent  
guitarist, with a clear, even voice,  
good stage presence and a pleasing  
sense of humor. Her original songs  
were well received also.  

The final performer was Iona  
Penteldon, who accompanied herself  
on the piano. She performed  
gospel and children's songs with a  
rich and powerful voice. She had  
the audience swaying, singing and  
clapping to tunes such as “One Day  
At A Time", "I’m On My Way" and “Put  
Your Hand In The Hand". She also  
performed a few original tunes, including  
“Friendship", written for the child-  
ren at Trinity Day Care Center.  

The evening was very much a suc-  
cess. With EMMA planning perhaps  
nine more events this year, we can  
look forward to other satisfying  
performances. If you want an evening  
of good entertainment in a suppor-  
tive atmosphere, check out the other  
“Voices of Women" events this year.  

FEMALES FIND FEET FINE,  
FIGURES FAT  

Through a survey of its readers,  
Glamour magazine says American women  
like their feet; but generally think  
the rest of their bodies are too  
fat. The information was taken from  
a survey on body image that polled  
33,000 women between the ages of  
18-35.  

Seventy-five percent of those  
women questioned considered them-  
selves to be overweight--though the  
survey showed that thirty-five percent  
were clinically underweight and  
only twenty-five percent were too  
heavy. Half of the women who an-  
swered the survey said they used  
diet pills to keep their weight  
down and fifteen percent reported  
self-induced vomiting as a method  
of weight control.  

ROCHESTER BLUE SHIELD  
DISALLOWS HOME BIRTHS  

The Rochester, N.Y., Blue Shield  
plan has decided to stop reimburse-  
ments for home births, saying that  
they are more dangerous than hospi-  
tal deliveries.  

Rochester Blue Shield is the only  
plan of 69 plans nationwide that  
will not pay for home births super-  
vised by a physician. Forty of the  
plans will reimburse for home births  
attended by certified nurse-midwives  
who must be supervised by doctors,  
said Charlotte Crenson, a spokesper-  
son for Blue Cross-Blue Shield Asso-  
ciation in Washington, D.C.  

Kevin Foley, a spokesperson for  
the State Insurance Department, said  
Blue Shield of Rochester has done  
nothing illegal. Medicaid in New  
York must reimburse for home births.  

This audience seemed to like  
Penteldon, who does blues.  

RIGHT TO LIFE TARGETS  
SIX SENATORS IN VENDETTA  

The National Right-to-Life Commit-  
tee has targeted six senators as  
political enemies of the anti-abortion  
movement.  

Republican William Cohen of  
Maine, Nancy Kassebaum of Kansas and  
Charles Percy of Illinois, plus  
Democrats Max Baucus of Montana,  
David Pryor of Arkansas and Carl  
Levin of Michigan were the six  
pointed out by the Committee.  

Douglas Johnson, the Right-to-Life  
legislative director said there  
was no one vote to single them out,  
rather a failure to act on anti-  
abortion issues generally.  

The same spokespeople, however,  
proclaimed Ronald Reagan the only  
presidential candidate to support  
the unborn child.  

CHILD-ABUSE HEARING  

A hearing to help determine legis-  
lation on the sexual abuse of chil-  
dren will be held on February 29  
at 10 A.M. at the Mahony State  
Office Building, 65 Court Street.  
The hearing is being sponsored by  
state groups studying domestic vio-  
lence and sexual abuse. Anyone  
interested in testifying should call  
the office of Assemblyman William  
Hoyt of Buffalo--847-3100.  

LOW DRAFT REGISTRATION  

REPORTED IN NEW YORK  

Only eight percent of the draft  
eligible men in New York City are  
registered with the government, says  
General Thomas Turnage, head of  
Selective Service.  

He feels that these young men  
haven't registered because they  
don't know that they are required  
to sign up. Selective Service is  
planning a publicity campaign to  
encourage those young men to regis-  
ter.

CONTROVERSIAL STUDY  
RELEASED ON AIDS  

A new government-funded study that  
links AIDS to blood transfusions  
shows that donors needn't have the  
disease to pass it on. The report,  
published in the New England Journal  
of Medicine will be raising some  
controversy as to the safety of the  
nation's blood supply.  

Officials from the nation's  
blood banks are calling the study  
"misleading", and are reporting  
increased screening of blood donors  
among the high-risk groups: homo-  
sexual men, Haitians, intravenous  
drug users and hemophiliacs.  

YOUNG BOYS EXPLOITED  

Philippine officials report that  
men posing as sponsors for inter-  
national relief agencies have been  
maintaining sex rings of young boys  
in resort towns on the islands,  
involving as many as 1,000 boys.  

A school principal in the town of  
Pagsanjan reported that some of  
these 'sponsors' registered to help  
an unusual amount of young boys,  
while never requesting girls to aid.  
The principal implied that these  
‘sponsors’ bribed officials to look  
the other way.  

HOSPITALS REQUIRED TO  
REPORT CHILD ABUSE  

A new regulation to increase re-  
porting of child abuse and neglect  
will be implemented in hospitals  
throughout New York State by April,  
said State Health Commissioner David  
Axelrod. The new rule will expand  
reporting requirements, now imposed  
on doctors and other health care  
workers, and require hospitals to  
set up formal procedures to report  
abuse. The state will also distri-  
bute a manual on abuse and neglect,  
and another on sexual abuse.  

Last year, the state hot line on  
child abuse received 125,000 calls  
on abused or neglected children,  
Axelrod said. The 24 hour, toll  
free number is 1-800-342-3720.
