NOTES FROM

WAND

The November 7th meeting of Women's  
Action for Nuclear Disarmament began  
with a potluck supper, and was a time  
when we could express our feelings  
about the recent elections. Express  
them we did—both during the potluck,  
and at the beginning of the meeting  
itself, when we also shared our ex-  
periences with the recent voter regis-  
tration drive.

The Citizens for Mondale/Ferraro  
Coalition, of which WAND was a part,  
and the Rainbow Coalition, registered  
a total of 17,000 new voters in Erie  
County. And in Erie County, the Mon-  
dale-Ferraro ticket won by a margin  
of 14,000 votes. This was gratifying  
to us, and we felt that our combined  
work had made a difference.

The Facilitators of the four  
District groups reported on their  
ongoing political and educational  
work, and anyone interested in joining  
the groups should phone the following  
numbers: Buffalo area, Rita 882-6494  
(evenings); Williamsville area,  
632-4397; Tonawandas, Eileen  
29 (evenings); and Southtowns,  

a ee

Festival of Trees, and WAND will  
decorate a tree with the theme  
"Ask the World of Us." The  
tree will be decorated with paper  
cranes, a peace symbol; and a hand  
will tell the story of Sadako  
Sasaki. Sadako is the Japanese girl  
who died as the result of the Hiroshima  
Bomb, and before she died, her quest  
was to make 10,000 paper cranes, a  
Japanese symbol of hope and life.  
After her death, her school friends  
completed her task, and Sadako and  
the cranes became an international  
peace symbol.

Our next WAND meeting will be  
January 16. The potluck will be at  
6:00 p.m. and the meeting at 7:30 p.m.,  
and we welcome all interested women.

“Hife’”’

"...A Hife By Any Other Name..."

by Ruth Geller

The problem was simple: I didn't  
know what to call her. “Friend"  
seemed insubstantial, and "lover" im-  
plied impermanence. "Mate" either  
sounded affectedly British or con-  
jured up visions of Zoo Parade. "The  
woman I live with" was abhorrent to  
my literary sensibilities because of  
its dangling participle. I considered  
and rejected “the woman with whom I  
live." The situation I referred to  
was, shall I say, queer enough to  
many people; I didn't want to further  
put them off by slapping them with  
correct grammar.

She suggested "partner," but I  
never felt quite comfortable with that.  
I always felt like I was talking about  
a business. Our Relationship, Inc.

When people knew her, I just said  
"Shane," and they knew what they'd  
heard about her, if not the truth.

It is with people who didn’t know her  
where the problems arose: when I was  
at work (where I go sporadically,  
part-time, and against my will); when  
I was in line at the supermarket or  
bank; to people who knew me casually  
but didn't know how I lived.

It was not a major problem, but  
as the years passed, I got increasing-  
ly annoyed that I had no simple accep-  
table understandable way to define her.

We were lying in bed with  
our respective reading material when  
it struck me that I wanted to marry  
her. I'd never wanted to get married,  
ever, to anyone; but after being with  
her for almost twelve years, I realized  
that I wanted to marry her. Not one  
of those pretend homosexual ceremonies  
that both of us find a little silly,  
but a real marriage, recognized by  
the State, to declare in the old-  
fashioned way that this was the woman  
I would love and cherish in sickness  
and in health, for richer or for  
poorer, till death do us part.

Knowing we could not do this, I  
think for the first time in my life  
I felt deeply and seriously discrim-  
inated against as a lesbian. More-  
over, I felt insulted. We share a  
love that is very special, and yet  
its existence is not recognized by  
that world out there as valid or  
real. I started expounding on this  
while she lay there with one of those  
"how come it took you so long to see  
the obvious" expressions on her face.

After a while I realized that even  
marriage wouldn't solve my problem  
with definitions, since she was  
neither a husband nor a wife. Then  
I got a brainstorm: we wouldn't be  
husband and wife; we'd be wusband and  
hife! She thought it was a brilliant  
idea (I love her for her good judge-  
ment) and I gave her the first choice  
of what to be. She decided against  
wusband because it sounded like some-  
thing in past tense, and it made her  
feel insecure. So I would be the  
wusband and she would be the hife.

A couple of days later we applied  
for a home mortgage. And wouldn't  
you know it, one of the first ques-  
tions was "marital status."

When that man across the desk asked  
Shane her marital status, we looked  
at one another, and I saw her lips  
move toward a smile. I, too, was  
tempted to smile but I knew if I did,  
she'd laugh. She gave me a look that  
said: Please? Can't I? Just this  
once? And I responded with a stern  
look that said: Come on now, don't  
mess around. This is a mortgage.

She sighed, and said, "Single,"  
and a great moment was lost.

But I am still tempted. Really  
tempted. One of these days, in  
casual conversation in line at the  
supermarket, I'm going to pop out with:  
“Yeah, the peppers are really beauti-  
ful, aren't they? My hife makes great  
stuffed peppers.”

It hasn't happened yet, but the  
day is coming. I can feel it. I can  
feel it in my wusband bones.
