The Supreme Court reaffirmed the
historic 1973 Roe v. Wade decision
regarding a woman's constitutional
right to privacy in controlling her
own pregnancy when it struck down,
as unconstitutional, abortion re-
strictions in Akron, Ohio, Missouri,
and Virginia. Since 1973, at least
22 states have passed some sort of
restrictions on abortion, many by
using a loophole in the 1973 decision
which says states have that right
if the health of the woman is in-
volved. There are an estimated
1.5 million abortions in the U.S.
each year, and in some localities,
such as Washington D.C., abortions
outnumber live births.

The most important ruling con-
cerned the necessity of hospitaliza-
tion for abortions in the second
trimester of pregnancy. This re-
striction made access to abortion
difficult for poor women, or women
whose local hospital or doctor
refused to perform abortions, since
it forbade clinics to do these
abortions.

Justice Lewis Powell, writing for
the majority, cited improved medical
technology and safe dilation and
evacuation abortion methods as one
reason to allow early second trimes-
ter abortions in licensed clinics
or outpatient facilities, refuting
the claim that these restrictions
are for the women's health. Accord-
ing to the Buffalo News, Justice
Powell wrote: "[the restriction
in Akron, Ohio] has imposed a
heavy, and unnecessary, burden on
women's access to a relatively in-
expensive, otherwise accessible and
safe abortion."

Interestingly, Justice Sandra
Day O'Connor in writing her dissent,
also used the improvement in medical
technology as part of her reasoning
for disagreeing. As medical ability
to keep younger and younger fetuses
alive improves, the point at which
a fetus is "viable" outside the
womb moves earlier and earlier in
a pregnancy. This part of Akron, Ohio
ordinance was the centerpiece of
anti-abortion legislation, and a
model for other area's anti-abortion
fights, because it seemed to fall
under the "woman's health" loophole.
Its failure to be upheld is a
victory for pro-choice activists.
More than 20 states require "full
service" hospitalization for abor-
tions after the first trimester.
Clinics, where as many as three-
fourths of all legal abortions are
performed, will now be able to do
these abortions much less expensively
than hospitals. States may
require clinics be licensed for
surgery, however. This may pro-
hibit some alternative or self-
help clinics.

Also struck down were restrictions
requiring 24-hour waiting periods
after a woman decides to have an
abortion, and counseling or informed
consent detailing fetal development,
warning women that a fetus is a
"human life," in addition to
an explanation of the abortion pro-
cedure. Both these regulations were
designed to discourage women from
having abortions, and were favorite
tactics of anti-abortion groups.

Twenty states have rules which
require either parental notification
or consent for abortions for minors.
The High Court ruled that such con-
sent laws must allow the minor an
opportunity to prove she is suffi-
ciently mature to make that decision
herself, and for the courts to ob-
tain consent for her if it can be
determined that an abortion is in
her best interests. This ruling,
while not permitting abortion on
demand for minors, does allow a
young woman some rights, and gives
the courts some flexibility in the
decision making.

The court did not overturn reg-
ulations that require a second
physician be present during second
trimester abortions. This was de-
termined to be within a state's
rights under Roe v. Wade, because a
fetus could survive at that point,
and because the woman's life is
also more at risk. The other
regulation left standing is one re-
quiring a pathology report on
the fetus after the abortion.

This latest set of rulings
affects the abortion debate in
several ways. Among them, it
brings the argument firmly back to
the right of a woman's privacy,
guaranteed by the constitution,
in controlling her pregnancy,
and away from individual states'
rights to impose restrictions.

It thus maintains a national
standard for abortion rights. Since
Roe v. Wade, the U.S. had again
developed a patchwork of state-by-
state regulations, many of which
were effectively removed by the
court's decision. By reaffirming
Roe v. Wade, this decision also
supports other pro-choice legis-
lation.

Jo Osborne, Executive Director
of Buffalo Planned Parenthood,
said, "The climate and momentum is
pro-choice now. [The decision]
makes such a strong statement of
reaffirmation of the 1973 decision.
Abortion is legal, and you can't put
restrictions on it."

According to Time Magazine June
27, Justice Powell emphasized that
it reinforces and clarifies a woman's
right to privacy. He wrote, "The
court repeatedly and consistently
has accepted and applied the basic
principle that a woman has the
