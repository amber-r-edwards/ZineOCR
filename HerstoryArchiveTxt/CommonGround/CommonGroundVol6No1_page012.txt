I was one of the idea people  
behind this theme issue of Common  
Ground. Regrettably, too few CG  
collective members are mothers.  
Our articles, in my opinion,  
don't always focus enough on  
motherhood. Yet the vast majority  
of women, at some point in their  
lives, will become mothers.  
Because giving birth alters—  
perhaps even devastates—the life  
of a woman in a myriad of ways,  
motherhood warrants the attention  
of all women, and especially  
feminist women.  

I am the mother of a 7-year-  
old boy and a 3-year-old girl.  
Their births turned my world  
upside-down. They have already  
presented me with some incredible  
challenges. They have also  
brought me joys and emotions I  
had never before felt. What are  
some of the hardships and rewards  
of raising children?  

Probably the greatest hardship  
is mothering in a vacuum. The  

nuclear family structure isolates  
us in separate dwellings, connec-  
ted only (but thankfully) by  
telephone lines. Each day in each  
dwelling, we replicate countless  
household tasks, resulting in an  
enormous waste of resources and  
time. We who are mothers squeeze  
all these monotonous tasks be-  
tween the demands of babies and  
children. So our children have  
limited contact with playmates,  
especially in winter. Worse,  
we mothers have far too little  
contact with, and support from,  
other mothers.  

Because the extended family  
has all but disappeared from  
the American scene, our mothers,  
aunts, and sisters are no longer  
close by to share their experience  
and to share children. Conse-  
quently, whenever we need to  
get out alone, we embark on the  
most dreaded of all the respon-  
sibilities of motherhood: The  
search for the perfect babysitter.  
And without family nearby, we  
mothers live in constant fear  
of getting sick.  

In a society that so ideal-  
izes the nuclear family, there  
is little community recognition  
of the effect of isolation on  
mothers—especially new mothers  
and stay-at-home mothers. I  
was pleased to see this lack  
of community support mentioned  
in a recent (August 10) front  
page article in THE BUFFALO NEWS.  
“Child Abuse and Neglect Become  
a County Crisis," by Peter Simon,  
lists, among other factors con-  
tributing to child abuse and  
neglect, the following: "Pro-  
grams providing counseling,  
parent-training, day care, in-  

The Pros  

home support, respite care, re-  
creation and transportation are  
badly inadequate or non-existent."  

So problems of isolation,  
whether it be for a brief mater-  
nity leave or for many years,  
remain largely unaddressed by  
our society. One notable excep-  
tion is the recent spate of Doula  
services across the country.  
These services exist to “mother  
the new mother," providing  
various at-home care services  
after a baby's birth. However,  
not all new mothers can afford  
such a service.  

The other major hardship of  
motherhood is that society does  
not view our work as work. His-  
torian Gerda Lerner recognized  
this when she titled a chapter  
of her book The Majority Finds  
Its Past "Just a Housewife." We  
are expected to care for children  
daily, no matter how draining,  
how trying and how tiring; nowa-  
days, we are even expected to  
do this while maintaining a paid  
job elsewhere.  

My first real jolt over lack  
of “job status" occurred when my  
first child was a newborn. Be-  
cause he was a poor sleeper, I  
did not get an uninterrupted  
night's sleep for three months.  
One night, in desperate exhaus-  
tion, I asked my husband to walk  
the floor with him for a while.  
The pat response, "I can't. I  
have to get up for work in the  
morning," was not very well  
thought out. Incredulous, I  
snapped, "Well, so do I. In  
fact, I still haven't gotten  
off work today, or the day be-  
fore. Or the day before that."  

Furthermore, society's inabil-  
ity to view mothering as real  
work means that we have no  
guaranteed breaks, no weekends  
or holidays off, no comp time,  
or personal leave. Of course,  
we all finagle our alone time,  
through our own resources. And  
often, it is at a price, either  
monetary (babysitting or day  
care) or personal (doing what  
society and/or our husbands deem  
acceptable, such as bowling or  
Tupperware parties).  

When our children are grown,  
do we receive unemployment or  
a pension? Of course not, since  
we never received wages for all  
those years of work as a mother.  

So these have been my great-  
est hardships as a mother. Per-  
sonally, my isolation has been  
enhanced by having a very small  
family, and parents who died  
before I had children. The  
other personal hardship for me  
these past seven years has been  
putting my career on the side-  
lines. I taught nothing when  
my children were infants, and  
when I did return, it was only  
to teach 1 or 2 courses a sem-  
ester. Mothers can rarely lunch  
with a colleague, read a journal,  
attend conferences, or luxuriate  
in the library. So motherhood  
has made me feel somewhat intel-  

lectually stifled.  
Despite all the hardships,  

being a mother has many rewards.  
One is a powerful sense of accom-  
plishment, and the first time  

and Cons of MOTHERHOOD  

most of us feel this is when we  
give birth. Enduring labor, de-  
livery and the postpartum period  
is a supreme accomplishment.  
Other more routine accomplish-  
ments with our children often  

go unnoticed; yet occasionally  
we sit back and realize just  
how much we are shaping the  

life of another human being.  

Another sense of power comes  
with being able to instill in  
our children the values that  
are important to us. For me,  
it is rewarding to raise my  
children in a non-sexist manner,  
since I often feel powerless  
to alter many other sexist in-  
stitutions in society. However,  
we mothers can have a hand in  
reversing the damaging effects  
of sex-role stereotyping both  
with our children and with their  
playmates.  

Another reward of parenthood  
is gaining a real sense of our  
history and our lineage. Now  
we are part of a family that  
will continue after we die. I  
delight in telling stories about  
my parents and grandparents to  
my children, so they too will  
someday have this sense of con-  
nection. I am also careful to  
emphasize matriarchal as well  
as patriarchal lines. In fact,  
not using my husband's surname  
is a symbol to my children that  
mothers are as important as  
fathers.  

Raising children also enables  
us to grow as adults. We learn  
countless skills, often out of  
necessity, at every stage of our  
child's life. We also learn res-  
ponsibility, and I think that  
having children is the ultimate  
responsibility. And we grow  
because we learn from our chil-  
dren, whose lives and experiences  
are different from ours.  

Finally, but most importantly,  
the best reward of all is recei-  
ving pure and often spontaneous  
affection. Young children are  
perhaps the only humans capable  
of loving women in a totally  
unbiased manner and who accept  
us unquestioningly for who we  
are. It's wonderful to be  
needed. And there's nothing  
in this world to match the hugs  
and kisses of one's child.
