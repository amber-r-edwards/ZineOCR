"I'm not really interested in  
what they do. I'm interested in  
what we do -- and in finding ways  
to do it.”

That was one of the messages  
delivered to Buffalo by Judy Grahn,  
who spoke Oct. 28 and 29 at the  
Allentown Community Center. A  
longtime writer and activist in  
the women's, lesbian-feminist, and  
gay movements, Grahn is the author  
of Another Mother Tongue: Gay  
Words, Gay Worlds, 1985 winner of  
the Gay Book Award of the American  
Library Association, as well as The  
Highest Apple: Sappho and the Lesbian  
Poetic Tradition; The Queen of  
Wands, her most recent book of poetry  
and five other books of poetry. She  
is also editor of True to Life Adventure  
Stories, Volumes I and II.

I drove 100 miles to hear Grahn  
read from The Queen of Wands and her  
next book of poetry, The Queen of  
Swords, and The Highest Apple. I  
met Grahn this summer at the Feminist  
Women's Writing Workshop at  
Wells College, where she was visiting  
poet and lecturer. Knowing  
what a powerful speaker she is, I  
wanted another infusion of that  
energy.

I also wanted to hear her read  
"Descent to the Butch of the Realm,"  
a long, immensely powerful many-level  
poem from The Queen of Swords,  
as yet unpublished. I heard her  
read it this summer -- and believe  
me, it's worth driving 100 miles  
for, or 1000.

The prose books Another Mother  
Tongue and The Highest Apple are  
an attempt to “reclaim our own history,"  
in the author's phrase. How  
did she come to write them? In 1974  
after writing the long poem "A  
Woman Talking to Death," Grahn was  
temporarily drained of poetry.

“From a book by Elizabeth Gould Davis  
I got the idea that women have a cultural  
history of our own," she said.  
"I began working on what was to become  
a series of five or six books.

I added the idea that gay people also  
probably have a cultural history of  
our own.”

"I began doing research," she  
continued. “The information snowballed,  
and I added some autobiography. As a  
lesbian poet, lesbian activist, and lesbian  
feminist, I turned out to be a very  
good subject for study."

"Another Mother Tongue is a very  
warm, wet book," she said. "I  
asked the question, 'What are the  
warm, wet facts of history?’ as opposed  
to the cold, dry facts. It's  
cultural history." The Highest Apple  
is a spin-off of the major work --  
"a chapter that didn't get in,"  
Grahn said. “I wanted to do a chap-  
ter on Sappho, but I was too tired.  
I always knew about Sappho, but I  
never really had seen much of her  
work. Six weeks after I finished  
Another Mother Tongue, I was invited  
to a small (west coast) college  
to give three lectures about Sappho.  
So I had to find out about her.  
(The book) lays down the basis for  
an entire Sapphic poetic tradition."  
In it, Grahn uses the work of nine  
American lesbian poets: Emily  
Dickinson, Gertrude Stein, H.D.,  
Amy Lowell, Audre Lorde, Adrienne  
Rich, Olga Broumas, Paula Gunn  
Allen, and Judy Grahn.

In Another Mother Tongue, Grahn  
sets up a way "to live in our pluralistic  
society" that is fundamentally  
different from the accepted way.  
“In mainstream American culture, you  
hear that everyone who doesn't fit in  
is marginal,” she said. "Black,  
Hispanic, gay and women writers are  
considered marginal." She noted that  
the idea of women as marginal "is  
ludicrous, given that we produce all  
the people. It's like saying a female cat  

EDITOR'S NOTE: CG was fortunate  
to receive two separate reviews  
of Judy Grahn's recent poetry  
reading in Buffalo, written by  
two well-known local writers.  
Since each brought something  
different and unique to the review  
we decided to run them both, in  
keeping with our philosophy of  
presenting the many perspectives  
of women's lives. Judy Grahn is a  
key figure, a pioneer of contemporary  
poetry, and a leading light of feminist  
philosophy who brought such a  
powerful response from Dickenson  
and Slavin that it seemed important  
to share both of their thoughts.

is marginal, and a tomcat is the  
main cat."

The orthodox view of the world  
implies "a circle that has a center"  
and, on the periphery, margins, she  
said. "The scheme is wrong. The  
picture is wrong. These two books  
posit the idea that none of these  
groups are marginal--that culture is  
a set of overlapping circles...Each  
one is central...for the people in  
it, and everyone else is marginal."

“So for me, a gay person, the gay  
political structure is multi-cultural  
--and for me, a white male Harvard-  
educated heterosexual is marginal.  
I'm marginal to him; I'm also marginal  
to southern rural black people.”

What about gays? "Gay people are  
not marginal--the closet makes us  
seem so...If we could dye all gay  
people, then fly over the U.S. with  
a spectroscope that would tick every  
time we flew over one, we'd see that  
gay people are on the margins of all  
kinds of groups...on the borders be-  
tween one group and another.”

The gay position at the border,  
Grahn said, symbolizes a gay function  
in society.

I think that's why Another Mother  
Tongue is such an important book, a  
book that should be read by everyone,  
not just the gay 10 percent. It's  
not only a cultural history of that  
10 percent--it's a cultural history  
of the 100 percent. To call gay people  
marginal, with the implication  
that society could do fine without  
them, is as ludicrous as to call women  
marginal. It would take only one ge-  
neration for society to collapse  
without women. Well, it wouldn't  
take much longer for society to col-  
lapse without its gay people, who  
stand on the borders, at the cross-  
roads, between one group and another,  
one idea and another, one time and  
another.

It's fitting that Grahn spoke to  
Buffalo during Halloween week. Hal-  
loween is a gay holiday for historic  
reasons, one of our pagan holidays.  
“Among the Celtic people in Europe,  
a brown-skinned, tribal indigenous  
people (who) intermarried with, and  
were killed off by, the white colo-  
nial Celts and later by the Romans,  
people believed the year didn't fit  
together too well at the end, and  
you might fall through the cracks  
where the holidays stand guard.

Maybe the world still doesn’t  
fit together too well. Maybe we'd  
all fall through the cracks if it  
weren't for the gay shamans who  
guard the joints and guide us from  
one segment to another.

You find gay people at the bor-  

borders, Grahn said. "You find gays in  
border towns, wherever there's a  
joining of one world to another,  
a neighborhood with a joining...  
One gay function is to carry cross-  
cultural attributes from one culture  
to another."

In tribal cultures, gay people  
belonged to a priesthood, Grahn said.  
“They were trained to go into the  
wilderness, consort with wolves,  
know the winds and the trees--and  
bring these back to the village.  
They also carried one village's ideas  
to another village...This was done  
by cross-dressed or specially-  
dressed gay men who did not dress  
like the rest of the males, the war-  
riors."

“Gay culture is (not a subculture;  
but) a supra-culture, a trans-cul-  
ture," Grahn said.

The center of any non-majority  
culture is the traditionals, Grahn  
said, "The traditionals remember the  
songs, the stories, the names of  
things--so that even when the people  
are colonized, they can find their  
way back by listening to the traditionals."

On Monday, October 28, at the  
Allentown Community Center, poet  
Judy Grahn read from The Queen  
of Wands and the forthcoming book  
The Queen of Swords. This was a  
Just Buffalo Series sponsored  
reading and a tour de force for  
Grahn--who has many tours de force  
and has yet to receive from the  
literary establishment the critical  
acclaim she deserves. Witness  
the absence of the literati  
from the October reading. De  
facto, Grahn brought to the series  
a critical perspective on the  
politics of the arts. Recently  
there have been complaints about  
gross sexism in certain Just  
Buffalo Literary Center events;  
and every area feminist let alone  
lesbian feminist poet to read in  
the series (a recent development  
except for Karen Lynn Peterson's  
early readings), has received  
second billing to a male poet,  
most of whom have lacked comparable  
skill and compatible themes. Recently  
the one person aware of these  
problems left Just Buffalo's  
employ. And, unfortunately, many  
who need a critical perspective  
on this politics of the arts did  
not attend the Grahn reading.

On Tuesday, October 29, during  
the noon hour, Grahn discussed  
her brilliant The Highest Apple  
essays (Spinsters Ink, 1985), on  
people attended. While the literary  
center deserves credit for sponsoring  
Grahn, it needs to take seriously the  
inaccessibility of noon events. Few  
U.S. poets earn their living by their art;  
many work at other jobs during  
the day. Further, Just Buffalo's  
publicity for events is poor,  
untimely and skimpy, heightening  
inaccessibility. Introducing  
another type of inaccessibility,  
the workshop was interrupted  
frequently by passers-through,  
causing the poet to lose her train  
of thought. Rendering a poet  
inaccessible to an audience  
also renders the audience in-  
accessible to the poet, an  
uncommendable double-edged  
practice.

In the future, Grahn will  
be "materializing poetry to take  
it out into the world; in short,  
facilitating access to poetry in  
forms other than the traditional  
chapbook, reading, collected  
works volume and leather bound  
shelf piece. Grahn's rationale  
for materializing is: “The more  
of myself I can take out into  
the (hostile) world the more at  
home I feel." This rationale  
set this reviewer to enjoying  
the poet's worldly self, in-  
cluding her pink Another Mother  
Tongue t-shirt, (Another Mother  
Tongue, Beacon Press, 1984 is  
Grahn's history of gay culture)  
worn beneath a black pinstriped  
teal blue shirt, under a black  
cotton smock. It was a wonderful  
mealy look--and later came a  
mealy, satisfying line of poetry:  
“What a disheveling needly  
thing she was." Poet Judy Grahn  
is tangible, as tangible as, e.g.  
her two volume collection of True  
to Life Adventure Stories  
(Diana Press, 1978, 1981), i.e.  
as Grahn describes the stories,  
as tangible as “the sound of a  
rock hitting another rock.”

Grahn began by reading from  
The Queen of Wands (The Crossing  
Press, 1982) her understanding  
of women's presence in the  
world and also the results of  
researching women's power in  
the world. (Wands is the ‘first’  
suit in the Tarot, standing for  
the discovery of the true self;  
its element is fire). As indeed  
she already has, Grahn wants to  
find in the world "lots of  
forces". To demonstrate—she  
read first "Helen's Names"  
(p. 16), each name on her tongue  
a glass marble spun out onto the  
ground glinting history:

Nona, Ilona, Lena,  
Ellen, Ella, Ellie,  
Nellie, Nell, Hel-Anie,  
Helaine.  
Lena, Lana, Lanya  
Helanya,  
Hello, Helanya.  
“Helanya./Hello, Helanya" seemed  
for Grahn the source of an internal  
tickle. As she read, and even as  
her Norse-looking brows arched  
high, her eyes crinkled at the  
corners. Among Grahn's many  
powerful attributes is her sense  
of humor. This reviewer appreciates  
poets with a sense of humor.

Grahn read next the title  
poem of The Queen of Wands. The  
poem concedes “how the world  
works:" On the one hand, “It is  
all like nets./ On the other hand/  
a spider lives in the topmost  
branches of a pine,/her house a  
god's eye gleaming among the  
needles" (p. 37). And then,  
there came a gleaming phrase,  
"the sun the center of my eye,”  
and a disturbance at the damn  
door of the community center,  
and a spurt of applause from  
first one set of hands, then  
several. The line of poetry,  
“whosoever chooses to love me..."  
rolled from the poet's tongue  
accompanied by a glint from the  
sun center of her eye and by a  
burst of sisterly laughter from  
the almost all-women audience.

*

As Grahn read "The Queen of  
Wands," my eyes lit upon her  
finely drawn sturdy hands, her  
left hand balled in a fist to  
turn pages, then thrust into  
her trousers pocket. Now this  
same hand perched on the upper  
edge of the open page. Grahn's  
is not a patient hand. Soon it  
tensed the lower edge of a page  
between thumb and index finger,  
then lay open on the page as if  
it were the page itself. Ex-  
citement surfaced at the knuckles,  
taking the hand to curling down  
the page and to showing a  
dimple at the base of the index  
finger, and finally, to leafing  
through The Queen of Wands in  
search of another poem.

In seemingly little time,  
Grahn came to another aspect of  
women’s presence in the world,  
The Queen of Swords; with this  
aspect, she came also to her own  
desire to have all her powers,  
"the lower as well as the higher."  
(Representing consciousness and  
connectedness, swords is the  
third Tarot suit; its element is  
air, the psychic realm). From  
this work in progress, Grahn read  
"Descent to the Butch of the  
Realm," a poem a year underway  
and nearly complete. We came to  
refer to it as the wild cherry  
poem.

Lately, Grahn said, “What  
I've been doing with poetry is  
researching it." She noted  
later, "We're not an endless  
resource." Archetypically, in  
the poem's title, the word  
"butch" might as well be “dyke”;  
both words are related to the  
word “goat." "The general idea  
is someone in charge of sacrifice..."  
Grahn said. The poem turns on a  
"trick of insight," like catching  
someone at “a very butch thing  
to do, changing a tire." And,
