'Girls are Cheered,  
Not Cheerleaders'

by E.R. Mann

Educating daughters has seldom  
been a priority in any culture or  
time, except to educate them (or  
leave them ignorant) to the degree  
that makes them optimally marriag-  
able.

Why then, would anyone go to  
the trouble and expense of provi-  
ding private, single-sex education  
for girls? Of what value is it  
to the girl (or parent) for her  
to be educated in an all female  
environment? Don't women want  
to be integrated into society?

We resent and try to bring down  
all male clubs and institutions,  
why support the ghettoizing influ-  
ence of all girl/all women insti-  
tutions?

As the product of an all girls'  
school education from grade four,  
and through high school at Buffalo  
Seminary, I would like to offer  
the following explanation: There  
is a vast difference between all  
male and all female institutions  
in this society. All male is  
highly valued and sought after  
and powerful, all female has a  
history of being an auxiliary to  

prestigious. I've never yet  
heard the argument pro or con,  
about male-only or female-only  
(Black-only, older women-only,  
lesbian-only, etc.) institutions  
where at the bottom of all the  
rhetoric on both sides wasn't  

the idea that these groups support  
and empower their members by and  
because of their exclusivity.  
Those with the power never refer  
to their grasp of power, access  

or prestige, au contraire! They  
are merely exercising their rights  
of free association and assembly  
privately. What is all the fuss  
about? Those seeking access to  
the power and membership of  

a club, a profession, a public  
office, see very clearly the  

value of that unexpressed access  
to power and want some too.

Getting off the topic of sin-  
gle sex education for girls? No  
indeed!

The key concept underlying the  
arguments for and against single  
sex education is what value is  
placed on the activity. Segrega-  
ted education where the boys learn  
all the skills for success in life  
and where the girls learn the  
skills for marrying a successful  
man is merely a more obvious ver-  
sion of the coeducational insti-  
tution where girls and boys attend  
the same classes and are expected  
to achieve--and are rewarded--  
differently.

The benefits of an all girls’  
school which academically and  
socially challenges young women,  
lie in the overt value and empower-  
ment placed on female achievement.  
Boys and men have life long oppor-  
tunities to be leaders, excel at  
sports, win academic kudos, organ-  

ize and direct and learn about  

the world as they would define  

it. Girls deserve this experience  
at success too.

Educating a daughter to value  
her self and her achievements and  
to rely on her own intelligence  
can happen in any setting. I sub-  
mit it is more likely to happen  
in an environment where all the  
energies are focused on her and  
where her female self is not sub-  
orned to male defined stereotypes  
or expectations. Until women and  
girls are more equally valued for  
themselves in mainstream society,  
there is a place for single-sex  
activities and education, as long  
as these are not merely a retreat  
from excellence.

If parents value their daughters  
for themselves, and are therefore  
interested in educating them,  
choosing an all girls' school is  
a viable and valuable alternative.  
A girl can find much the same sort  
of empowerment and experience  
participating in Girl Scouting  
or other leadership training and  
development programs for girls.

The essentials are different, but  
the essentials are the same:  

valuing girls and their achieve-  
ments. Some of these other pro-  
grams are less expensive than a  
private girls' school too, although  
not as all encompassing and  

intense, and not to everyone's  
taste.

The following are some comments  
submitted by Bob Foster, current  
Headmaster at The Buffalo Seminary,  
which I solicited on the topic of  
single sex education:

Elisabeth Mann, a 1973 graduate  
of The Buffalo Seminary and a per-  
son affiliated with Common Ground,  
wrote me a letter back in June  
requesting that someone do up an  
article setting forth "the rela-  
tive advantages and disadvantages  
of single-sex education for females."  
Since in a school, faculty exit  
with whoops of joy in June and  
return late in August, long past  
the September deadline for Common  
Ground, the task devolves upon me.  
I would as soon write an article  
on quantum mechanics or the sudden  
disappearance of the dinosaurs,  
since more is known regarding these  
phenomena than about Elisabeth's  
topic.

Very little solid work has been  
done weighing the pros and cons of  
single sex education (the lonely-  
sounding, inappropriate term applied  
to the experience). I can recall  
--back in her year, in fact,  
scratching around for solid infor-  
mation. The best that I could  
come up with back in '72-'73 was  
a lot of self-serving material  
from boys' schools that had already  
made up their minds to go "coed"  
(it was the fad back then) and a

Single Parent Adoption

by K. M. Schwede

Most little girls grow up  
believing that someday they will  
be a mother. I was no exception,  
but I never wanted to marry. Even  
as a young child I knew I would  
never marry though I always knew  
I wanted to have children.

Parenthood, by choice, for a  
single woman is not always an  
easy issue. Involving a man in  
the process creates potential  
legal issues. Artificial insem-  
ination within the medical system  
is not always available for  
single women and can be very  
expensive. Informal arrangements  
for artificial insemination are  
difficult and subject to health  
risks. Adoption is often closed  
to single people, and when children  
are available for adoption by sin-  
gles they are usually older--not  
infants--, and likely to be  
physically and/or mentally handi-  
capped, and come with a history  
of "problems."

Several years ago an unmarried  
friend adopted a child from South  
America. She was able to adopt a  
baby and eventually adopted three  
children. This presented an inter-  
esting but also the conflict of  
taking a child from its own cul-  
ture: should one do that? Is it  
ethnocentric? How do adoptive  
parents present the child's true  
cultural heritage--especially if  
they know little about it? On  
the other side, birth rates are  
so high in many countries, and  
the poverty so extreme that many  
children may well die from mal-  
nutrition or disease on the  
streets or in over-crowded  
orphanages.

The major problems with inter-  
national adoption are the constantly  
changing and unstable political  
issues involved in the process:  
finding a good agency to work with,  
preferably one that has handled  
adoption for single women success-  
fully, avoiding the more conserva-  
tive agencies; and finally cost,  
which is now between $5,000 and  
$10,000. Each country has differ-  
ent regulations, such as the par-  
ent(s) must come to the country  
to pick up the child, a culturally  
appropriate name must be chosen,  
etc. It is not totally risk free.  
It is possible to have a picture  
of the child, to be paying monthly  
support and to still have trouble  
getting the child out of the coun-  
try due to internal political  
problems.

In Buffalo, there is a support  
group for single adopting women.  
The group provides advice and in-  
formation about which agencies are  
best to use, problem solving sup-  
port through the adoption process  
and social activities for women  
and their children during the  
year.

Nationally there is a group  
that publishes materials to sup-  
port international adoption by  
single women and men. For more  
information write to: Committee  
for Single Adoptive Parents, P.O.
