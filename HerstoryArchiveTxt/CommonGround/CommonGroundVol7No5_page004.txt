NEW BIOGRAPHIES

THE LONGEST BOOK REVIEW EVER

WRITTEN IN THE HISTORY OF THE
WORLD, NO Aca

by Judith Geer

The books began piling up on my
dining room table last summer.
"There!" I'd say, adding one to the
pile. "Another good one to write a
review about." There are four of
them now in a neat pile awaiting my
attention, so I'll get to it. All
the books are autobiographies by
women — two American, one Chinese,
one French — who try to make sense
out of their surroundings and find
truths in the hostility and beauty
of life.

Cheng, Nien. LIFE AND DEATH IN
SHANGHAI. New York: Grove Press;
1986. ISBN 0-394-55548-1

Nien Cheng, author of LIFE AND
DEATH IN SHANGHAI, has a quiet,
elegant writing style, even when
describing devastating cruelty.
Mrs. Cheng was a highly educated,
wealthy widow living in Shanghai
with her actress daughter, Meiping,
when the Cultural Revolution
erupted in 1966. The Chengs had

lived in many parts of the world
over the years before Mr. Cheng's
death when he had been an executive
with Shell Oil Co. Upon his death
in 1957, Mrs. Cheng had taken his
place in the company and as such
was targeted early on by the young
zealots in the Cultural Revolution
as someone who needed
"re-educating." This re-education
began when young people broke into
her home and began smashing her
porcelain collection, burning her
books in the yard and interrogating
her about her beliefs. Meiping was
spared persecution at first because
she belonged to a union and as such
was considered properly

proletariat. Mrs. Cheng was
frequently subjected to vicious
verbal harangues as the young Red
Guards returned several times to
loot or destroy her belongings.
Eventually she was taken off to
prison where she spent seven years
suffering hunger, cold and disease
and surviving by her wits,
ostensibly for being well-educated
and having foreign ties. When Mrs.
Cheng was released from prison she
learned that her beloved Meiping
had committed suicide.

So, Meiping was really dead,
just as I had suspected...Yet
how desperately I had clung to
the hope that I would somehow
find her alive when I came out
of prison. Now my last spark of
hope was snuffed out. Now there
was nothing left. It would have
been less painful if I had died
in prison and never known that
Meiping was dead. My struggle
to keep alive and fight against
adversity, so vitally important
at the time, suddenly seemed
meaningless. (p. 360)

It wasn't until much later that
she found that her daughter had
actually been murdered during a
supposed interrogation session.

Mrs. Cheng's persecution did not
end with her release from prison.
Several years of precarious living,
always staying one or two steps
away from re-arrest, ensued before
the political climate in China
changed with the death of Mao and
the fall from grace of his powerful
widow. Mrs. Cheng was able to
leave for the U.S. in 1980, and has
made her home in Washington, D.C.
Her story is a real page-turner,
offering insight into a culture in
crisis as well as into the mind of
a brilliant, deeply caring woman of
courage. She writes, as follows:

In this atmosphere of freedom
and relaxation, I feel a
lightening of spirit, especially
since I have completed this
book. What I enjoy more than
anything else is the wealth of
information available in the
form of books, magazine
articles, and newspaper reports,
and the various activities that
bring me into the company of
people who share my interests.
I live a full and busy life.
Only sometimes I feel a haunting
sadness. At dusk, when the day
is fading away and my physical
energy is at a low ebb, I may
find myself depressed and
nostalgic. But next morning I
invariably wake up with renewed
optimism to welcome the day as

another God-given opportunity
for enlightenment and
experience. (p. 538)

Marguerite Duras

Duras, Marguerite. THE WAR: A
MEMOIR. New York: Pantheon Books,

1986. ISBN 0-394-55236-9

Journalist Marguerite
Duras has produced a stunning
little book called THE WAR,
containing a diary she kept over 40
years ago and some short stories
all dealing with the waning days of
World War II. Mrs. Duras' staccato
prose lashes out relentlessly,
pulling the reader into a world of
jumbled emotions, magnified
seemingly beyond understanding by
the horror of the times. A diary
Ms. Duras kept while waiting for
her husband, Robert, to be released
from a concentration camp begins
the volume. She states that she
only recently found the diary and
cannot remember having written it.
The trauma of her ordeal, evident
in her tormented words, would
surely account for such a lapse of
memory. Ms. Duras and Robert were
both members of the French
Resistance but only Robert was
captured and incarcerated. When
the camps were liberated one by
one, in the spring of 1945, Ms.
Duras describes the anguish of
estimating how long it would take
for a liberated Robert to return to
her in Paris. The nation was in
turmoil and communications were
almost non-existent. When she had
finally convinced herself that he
must be dead, friends in the
Resistance located him, sneaked him
out of the liberated camp and brought
him home to her, literally on
death's doorstep.

French

I heard stifled cries on the
stairs, a stir, a clatter of
feet. Then doors banging and
shouts. It was them. It was
them, back from Germany.

I couldn't stop myself - I
started to run downstairs, to
escape into the street.
Beauchamp and D. were supporting
him under the arms. They'd
stopped on the first-floor
landing. He was looking up.

I can't remember exactly what
happened. He must have looked
at me and recognized me and
smiled. I shrieked no, that I
didn't want to see. I started
to run again, up the stairs this
time. I was shrieking, I
remember that. The war emerged
in my shrieks...

In my memory, at a certain
moment, the sounds stop and I
see him. Huge. There before
me. I don't recognize him. He
looks at me. He smiles...It's a
smile of embarrassment. He's
apologizing for being here,
