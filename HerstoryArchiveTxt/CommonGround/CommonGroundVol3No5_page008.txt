refer enthusiastically to this  
partitioned 'studio' with its  
cold skylights and miniature  
penny-in-the-slot gas fires;  
they describe the pleasant  
trivialities of our daily  
routine with its strenuous  
arguments over mop and duster,  
its egg and cheese suppers  
cooked on a gas-ring, its  
adornment by coloured bowls  
of bluebells or wallflowers  
picked up cheap from a pave-  
ment flower-seller. (pg. 114-115)  

Winifred's first novel ANDERBY  
WOLD is published in 1922, when she  
is 25 years old. Her journalistic  
skills attract the attention of Lady  
Rhondda, publisher of the progres-  
sive London journal TIME AND TIDE,  
and Winifred begins writing reg-  
ularly for it (she becomes its  
director in 1926). In June 1925,  
Vera marries and goes to the States  
to live with her professor hus-  
band. Rather than diminishing  
during this separation, the friend-  
ship between Vera and Winifred  
grows stronger, buttressed by  
lengthy correspondence and the depth  
of experience they had shared in  
the past. Months later Vera and  
her family return from the U.S. and  
take up residence with Winifred  
once again.  

After a long sojourn in South  
Africa (where she visits Jean Mc-  
William and becomes staunchly anti-  
apartheid) and the publication of  
several other books, Winifred's  
literary success and reputation as  
an effective activist for social  
causes burgeons. It is ironically  
at this time that her fatal illness  
begins to show itself. With great  
tenderness and restraint Vera re-  
lates Winifred's last months of life  
and her own grief knowing her friend  
would soon die.  

I was struck while reading TEST-  
AMENT OF FRIENDSHIP by how remark-  
ably strong these women were to  
have broken through the wall of hor-  
ror and sorrow after World War I,  
to have forged lives for themselves  
and through it all to have remained  
constant to a relationship which  
any one of a number of events which  
they endured could have destroyed.  

Finally, there are many moving  
moments in TESTAMENT OF FRIENDSHIP,  
but one of the most beautiful parts  
is a letter which Winifred had  
written to her mother who had ex-  
pressed concern for her daughter's  
feelings over Vera's forthcoming  
marriage. I leave you with this  
little jewel of prose since it so  
completely crystallizes the philos-  
ophy of these remarkable women.  

"As for suffering, dear  
heart, don't you see that long  
ago I saw that this was in-  
evitable? It is a thing that  
one cannot escape from unless  
one hides from life. Do you  
think for a moment that when I  
see what I do see of human sor-  
row...that I should want to take  
the easy road? I ask nothing  
better than to be allowed the  
very high privilege of ‘writing  
with my heart's blood,' if that  
may be. I ask that I may suffer  

for those things which are high  
and brave and lovely, and that  
I may not be weak when suffering  

For the end, success,  
ruin or achievement, I think that it matters so little.  
The stuff of life that matters  
is experience. I ask that I may  
be permitted to love much, to  
serve to the utmost limit of my  
capacity, and to keep faith with  
that high vision which men call  
God. I shan't do it wholly.  
Nobody does that. I ask to  
never stop caring. Such things don't matter." (pg.  

144-145)

THE SAMPLER  

Stretched tautly  

between cork protected  

metal hoops  

A cross-stitch sampler  

waited for its first injection  
of embroidery floss.  

Six year old fingers  

felt out of place; left hand  
balancing porous cloth,  
finger tips throbbing  

from needle bores.  

Right aim, three strikes  
equals an out,  

an impatient squiggler  
wondering why she must  

learn this art.  

"Two strands at a time," the old lady  
Umpire calling foul.  
“Not such a long thread or  
it will get tangled. Precision,  
precision, precision."  
Under-developed vocabulary disallowed  
cussing the ump;  

“Mumbling extended the battle.  

The ABC's got bloodied  

The message slipped with stitches.  
Impatience danced a leit-motif:  

Knotted floss,  

holey cloth.  

Quixotic quest destined  

for retirement within a hopeless chest.  

Time claimed the old lady  
nineteen years ago.  

A lady hardly known then;  

known so well now.  

Her words outlived the sampler's  
precisely gnarled thread,  

the mumbling loquacity  
subconsciously weaving the  
multicolored pattern on  

my life.  

Art that must be learned.
