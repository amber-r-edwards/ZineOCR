COMMON GROUND

Vol. 1 No. 5

By Maria Ceraulo

It may not look like your average  
class: twelve or so women sitting  
in a circle (maybe on the floor). It  
is difficult to tell who is the teach-  
er because no one monopolizes the  
conversation.

This is the atmosphere at the  
Women's Writing Workshop in Poetry,  
which is part of the Women's Studies  
College at the University of Buffalo.

The Workshop began in the  
spring of 1971, the semester  
after Women's Studies College  
was launched. It was start-  
ed in response to a demand by  
women writers for a stress-free  
writing environment. Since its  
inception, the Workshop has  
reached between 100 to 200 wom-  
en (Many women choose to re-  
peat the course.)

"We encourage a creative  
writing space for women writ-  
ers," says Lisa Albrecht, who,  
along with Susan Prince, co-  
ordinates this Workshop.  
"We see a lot of wounds  
in the University system. In  
some English classes, a pro-  
fessor sits in the front of the  
class and 'hands down' his  
wisdom."

The course is student-run.  
Women are recognized by "ro-  
tating chair" - the last person  
to speak recognizes the next  
person, who in turn recognizes  
someone else. With freedom  
comes added responsibility.  
Each woman acts as class faci-  
litator at least once. This  
might include leading a writing  
exercise or reading and discussing a  
published author.

"Our environment is very support-  
ive," says Susan, a senior at U.B.  
"Because we have women of different  
capabilities, we really encourage  
newer poets who may need extra self-  
confidence. At the same time, we  
don't let the class become dominated  
by older poets."

Every semester, Susan and Lisa  
creatively try to ease the stiffness  
and anxiety of the first few meetings,  
when trust among writers must be  
established. In the first class, the  
group writes a poem collectively.

A sheet of paper is passed and each  
woman adds a line, seeing only the  
previous line written. "We also do  
personal herstories," Lisa explains,  
"to get a better feel for our back-  
grounds and where everyone is in  
their writing and their lives."

A typical class begins with a  
"check in" when students can tell  
how their day went and what mood  
they're in. If there is no class  
exercise, a woman will pass out

copies of her poem and read it a-  
loud. After a moment of silence  

for students to "digest" the poem,  

a discussion begins. "Criticism  

is always done in a constructive  
way," Susan notes. During this time,  

the poet cannot respond, but fre-  
quently jots notes down on what is  
said. According to Lisa, "we believe  
the writer needs feedback and we  
don't want confrontations between  
her and the students during the  
discussion." Afterwards, the poet

is free to respond to criticism, make  
her own comments or say nothing.

"We are interested in how women  
write," Lisa says. "We believe a  
woman's total experiences are valid  
and important to her writing.

By its nature, the workshop often  
delves beyond writing itself. Susan  

explains that "lives are changed  
in the workshop because women are  
exposed to different things and  
approaches about writing and  
themselves."

The workshop recognizes that  
historically as women, we have been  
denied our voices. Women's issues are  
often raised. "For many women," says  
Lisa, "the workshop crystalizes and  
personalizes these issues. Some  
women call themselves feminists  
after our class who didn't before  
they started the class. Writing is  
thinking and if you are thinking  
about your life and how to change  
it, you have to look at women's  
oppression."

Susan adds, "It's hard to put a

name on what happens in the class.  
We are committed to helping women  
gain confidence in their writing  
and to share it publicly. In our  
class, this may mean going beyond  
yourself."

For the past five years, the  
Workshop annually publishes A  
Room of Our Own. It is an anthology  
of poetry written and collected by  
the Women's Writing Workshop. Be-  
cause it is funded by the University  
(Sub Board I), the women are al-  

ways aware of budget cuts. The  

publication's funding was de-  
nied two years ago. After pro-  
test from the Workshop, the  
Board later reversed its deci-  
sion. Just recently, the Work-  
shop was re-funded for its  
Spring ‘83 publication.

At least twice a year, the  
women hold a public reading,  
usually at the end of every  
semester. About 50 people at-  
tended the most recent reading,  
held December 10 at Bethune  
Hall. According to the teach-  
ers, it is not uncommon for  
some women to take the course  
after seeing the group's read-  
ing.

"Although we are very grate-  
ful for the University's co-  
operation and space," notes  
Lisa, "sometimes a university  
setting is a barrier in reach-  
ing some women." Most of the  
writers are U.B. students, but  
arrangements can be made for  
community visitors.

To help reduce expenses, the  
women agree to teach one semes-  
ter of the year on a voluntary  
basis, and are paid for one  
semester.

The course is taught at Women's  
Studies College, 108 Winspear on  
Thursday evenings. For more

COMMON GROUND is still soliciting  
material for our special issue on wo-  
men and the immigrant experience. We  
are looking for personal her-stories,  
tales your grandmother told you, the  
experiences of women who have come here  
from another country, the experiences  
of women who have moved from one part  
of this country to another, from one  
culture to another, also book reviews,  
narratives, essays on immigration,  
works by Native American, Latina and  
Black women, Asian and Jewish women--  
anyone who has a story to tell. All  
material must be in by JANUARY 15, 1983.
