#1  

Night-times are  

Five blankets cold.  
Day-times, clothes  

Peel from the skin..  

As the green walnut ripens  
Two summers golden  

With acrid sweetness  

#2  

We corn-maidens dance  

Our ritual of Autumn  
Silk-tasselled-hair-flowing  
Green-tattered-skirts-rustling  
Taking from earth-mother  
And..her fruition; giving.  

#3  

Two young naked bodies entwined  
Rocking, sleeping in the hammock  
Nurturing; healing ancestral cradle  
Wounds of girl-babies, unwanted.  

#4  

Old grandmother, white-haired  
Prune-lipped, dour-eyed  

Pained of life  

Sun-baked, red-skinned and mottled  
Leathery arms, crinkled, awaiting  
her dust,  

#5  

Amethyst and Rosebud, Sunshine  
And Starburst, earth-children-free  
As the wind encircling  

Listening and mouthing  

Our words and bodies  

Shadows of ourselves, ever-moving.  

#6  

Gypsy womyn around  

The campfire you  

Dance, Sing, Share  
Stories of yourself-skin  
We listen  

#7  

Healing...  

You reach out giving  

Hugs to feel the flesh  

Of another as your-  

Self; wizened from lack-love  
And too little of the  
Nurturant of touch.  

#8  

Your revolutionary politics is "process"  
And without attachment to results  

You sow your seed; other wimmin  

Come later and reap your produce,  
Re-seeding the land burnishing peace-tools  
Which you come to work with,  

Laid-by in farewell.

“Rainbows Gini, Rainbows Mary,  

Go where you're gonna go,  

Do what you're gonna do, because  
You go in love." **  

Goodbye songs, farewell hands  
Reach, arms, hugs, Seneca Womyn's  
Dreams go out into forever  

No boundaries or nations  

Hold this Seneca Womyn  

Her tribal nation is Peace.  

**Farewell song sung at Seneca  

by Eleanor Skelton Cash  
Written August 25, 1985 at Seneca Women's  
Peace Camp  

POETRY  

Herstories voiced in circle  
bonding earth and woman  
sounding cycles  
of conscious infinitives  
a journey of self healing  
in mind of emotion  
motioning self love.

FOR THE POET  

Who writes the poem  

offering to caress,  

a shoulder for despair?  

Who walks the night crying  

for the touch or embrace,  

seeing her  

reflection of the moon?  

Who longs for the shadows  

their bodies would make,  

dancing by the window  

wide open to starlight?  

Who lavishes affection on a cat,  
speaking dreams and fantasies  
to twitching ears glowing in the deep,  
letting shivers arch soft hairs on the neck  
and lift the breast?  

Ah, she...  

She writes endlessly  

taking in the days,  

A process of transformation:  
Bearing witness,  

bearing pain,  

baring the soul so tender  

in spiral-bound books,  

on blue lined sheets;  

writing for none to see.  

Who sings a poem for this poet?

THE MISSING CHAUFFEUR  

I am  

who I was not intended to be,  

a woman who chooses.  

No barriers here, there is always a danger.  
Out in suburbia, a shiny red station wagon  
meant for me, remains driverless.  

I never wanted it, never met its owner,  
didn’t go to college to catch him.  

In the end,  

we all must stand ourselves.

CUBIC ZIRCONIA ISN'T A GIRL'S BEST FRIEND  

Watching the mauve and navy sunset tonight  
eating plain yogurt.  

Dreaming of blueberries and your smile (how white  
your teeth were after we came back from the  
beach and your face was tan!)  

Waiting for your licorice arm to  
pick me up and sweep me away or  
even for your cherry-covered voice  
"I thought of you once today."  

Darkening sky - a glittering dot  
"I wish he loved me  
half as much as I love him."  
does a wish on  
zircon ever count?

I was wearing red  
and stayed after school  
because I knew you had  
detention  
that day.  
I walked up three flights of  
stairs alongside of you,  
my heart doing thump-thump  
that doubled the beat  
of my feet upon the cold,  
nervous stairs, said stupid irrelevant  
things and saw your locker.  
You flashed that wicked smile that so  
reminded me of someone  
and my stomach turned  
as I watched you walk away.  
I leaned up against the  
wall and thought how  
unfair adolescence was.
