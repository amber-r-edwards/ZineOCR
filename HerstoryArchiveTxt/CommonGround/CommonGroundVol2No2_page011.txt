MOSCOW WOMEN

Hansson and Karin Liden. N.Y., Random  
House 1983.

When Americans think about Soviet  

women, it is vital to remember history.  

Twenty million Russians died in  
World War II, a majority of them men.  
During the 2-1/2 year blockade of  
Leningrad alone, nearly one and a  
half million people died of starva-  
tion and other causes. Proportion-  
ately, that's as if 2,400,000 New  
York City residents had died... or,  
in the nation as a whole, as if  
World War II had cost the U.S. 25  
million people.  

Add to that the 20 million Soviet  
citizens who died of persecution and  
in camps during the Stalin years.  
Imagine the death of 50 million  
Americans in a generation -- a gen-  
eration, moreover, that was pre-  
ceded by the Russian civil war,  
the revolution and World War I.  

The U.S.S.R. was invaded and  
bombed by the Germans during W.W.II.  
Houses, apartments, and factories  
were reduced to rubble. Everyone  
over 14 went to work; education was  
suspended; the food-delivery system  
was decimated. Women stepped into  
heavy jobs in industry and agri-  
culture. And when the war ended,  
things did not return to their pre-  
war state. There was a shortage of  
men, especially young, able-bodied  
men -- not only for work in factories  
and on farms, but also for family  
life. There were not as many men  
to marry. No husbands... fathers...  
sons. It is hard to overstate the  
impact on generations of women.  

In 1978, two Swedes, Carola  
Hansson and Karin Liden, recorded  
interviews with 13 Moscow women.  
Just that statement hides a multi-  
plicity of problems for the authors.  
"We could not simply enter the  
country with tape recorders in hand,"  
they reported. Instead, they borrowed  
a machine once in Moscow and  
smuggled the finished tapes back to  
Sweden. The women's real names  
could not be used.  

As in the U.S., daycare is a  
problem. Liza, a 28-year-old divorced  
editor, describes a typical Monday  
morning:  

"I woke at six, pulled my [three  
year old] child out of bed,  
packed a bag for the whole  
week, and then he and I took  
off for the subway. It took  
us fifty minutes to get to  
the daycare center. I took  
him inside... He cried, 'Mama  
I don't want to stay here...'  

I said, ‘Emil, sweetheart...  
I'll pick you up on Friday...'  
It was terrible, but I had to  
hurry off to work. I left him  
crying..."  

COMMON GROUND OCTOBER 1983 PAGE EIGHT  

At least Liza and Emil, because  
of help from Liza's parents, have  
their own apartment; 25 percent of  
Russia's city-dwellers (and a major-  
ity of young couples and single  
people) live in communal apartments,  
sharing kitchen and bathroom with  
other families.  

Most Russian women work full-time:  
women hold a disproportionate number  
of jobs in the textile, food, service  
and child-related industries (average  
pay: 100 rubles -- about $130 -- a  
month or less), whereas most miners,  
for instance -- average pay 200 rubles --  
are men.  

Birth control seems practically  
non-existent. Condoms are either so  
heavy they eliminate sensation or  
uselessly flimsy. Says Sonya, an un-  
employed linguist:  

"There are lots of home rem-  

edies... My grandmother told me  

that a little urine kills sperm  
... Some women (have abortions)  
ten or fifteen times. Often it  
is the only way out... since so  
many men absolutely refuse to  

use condoms."  

Pills are inferior, dangerous, and  
only sporadically available (the  
State, disturbed by Russia's low  
birth rate, doesn't encourage their  
use); there's a long wait for an  
IUD; diaphragms are available in  

two sizes; and jellies and creams are  
hard to find.  

Because abortion is legal and  
state-sponsored, Russian women have  
trouble understanding why it is a  
major issue for Western feminists.  
Russian women, in fact, seem puzzled  
about feminism as a whole. Over and  
over, they express bewilderment --  
after all, equality for women is an  
accomplished fact in Russia! -- and  
then they go on to describe appalling  
sexism.  

"I've never been discriminated  
against," says Lyuba, 32, an artist.  
"No one ever said there ought to be  
a man in my place. No, it's the fact  
that I'm a mother that gets in my way.  
Of course employers prefer men be-  
cause... if a child is sick the man  
keeps on working, but the wife has  
to stay home... When the children are  
12 to 15, the woman can begin to  
advance."  

Out of 320 members of the Com-  
munist Party's Central Committee,  
only 8 are women. The powerful Pol-  
itburo is 100 percent male. Yet in  
interview after interview, these  
women say boys -- but not girls --  
should be brought up strong, brave,  

aggressive, and self-reliant. Ac-  
cording to Lida, a chambermaid who  
wanted to be a geologist but was  
discouraged -- because of her sex --  
by her parents,  

“A girl, of course, can be  
spoiled with toys and finery.  
She can learn from the  
beginning to be well-groom-  
ed, kind, charming and grace-  
ful.  

The authors asked some of the  
women if they're familiar with our  
women's movement. Here's what they  
said:  

Liza: "Yes, I'm familiar with  
the movement to legalize abortion  
and women's rights, but where the  
right to vote is concerned -- here all  
women have the right to vote. We  
don't need a women's movement...  

But I think when women were emanci-  
pated, it actually amounted to men's  
liberation from the family... Here  
equality consists of the woman  
carrying the heaviest burden."  

Nadezha Pavlovna, a Ph.D., mem-  
ber of the Communist Party, and uni-  
versity professor: "We don't need  
that here. Emancipation is part of  
our life. I assure you that question  
isn't a problem here..."  

Tanya, 24, a sociology teacher:  
"We're so different from you. We  
aren't active. We've been taught to  
leave our problems to the government  
...(It) thinks for us, takes care of  
us... Perhaps we ought to be a little  
more active, but I don’t know how...  
You can hardly go to your repre-  
sentative and tell him that you want  
to write your dissertation, but have  
two children who need to be cared for.  
There are more serious problems [like]  
the lack of housing."  

The authors asked Lyuba if she  
resented having to stay home with the  
baby for five years while her husband  
pursued his artistic career:  

"Perhaps I did feel envy. But  
more than that I felt despair.  
It was as if something died in  
me, and I felt paralyzed. I  
neglected myself -- didn’t wash  
or dress or comb my hair. I  
did everything I was supposed  
to for my husband and the child  
-- washed, cooked. But I didn't  
want to do anything else. I  
would have preferred to die,  
but the child needed me..."  

Said Natasha, 22, a law student:  
"It's harder for a woman to get  
a part-time job, and then she  
has the children... When (a  
woman) is around 35 to 40 years  
old, life becomes difficult...  
she begins to get fat and  

lose her glow. This is quite  
natural. Her home, her fam-  
ily and her job leave her no  
time for herself... There's  
hardly a man who can manage to  
be faithful..."
