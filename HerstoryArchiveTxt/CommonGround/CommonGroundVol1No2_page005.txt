Diary of a Music Festival

by Marilyn

Editor's Note: Common Ground asked  
Marilyn to report on her experiences  
at the 7th Annual Michigan Womyn's  
Music Festival, which is a great  
gathering of mothers and daughters  
on women's land for a week of music,  
workshops, arts, crafts, food, work,  
friendships, networking and fun.

The following is a diary of her  
experience there.

9:30 a.m. Thursday, August 12,  
at a train station in the Midwest -  
finally, it's time for this adventure  

to begin! I'm ready. Barb's train  
has been delayed an hour. (Somehow  
I knew this would happen.) I'm glad  

I brought my latest engrossing-but-  
not-too-taxing novel to read. It's  
going to be so good to see her after  
10 days' separation. I've been in  
the Northwest for a week visiting  

my cousin and seeing the magnificent  
countryside there and have stopped  
here for a short family visit be-  
fore going on to the Seventh Annual  
Michigan Womyn's Music Festival.  
Barb and I have been looking forward  
to this festival for months. Meg,  
our upstairs neighbor and a corner-  
stone in our ‘family of friends', is  
meeting us in Brighton, Mich., so we  
can drive in tandem to the festival.  
We'll meet Margaret and Jeanette  
there on Friday.

Four days in the woods listening  
to wonderful music with 8,000 women,  
mostly lesbians, including a circle  
of my own friends and my lover. The  
idea is bucolic and I'm excited!

7:30 p.m. Thursday, on the Music  
Festival grounds near Hart, Michigan -  
Finally. Campsite chosen. Tents  
pitched. Lost gear retrieved. This  
process took forever! It was about  
3:30 p.m. when we turned onto U.S. 31  
and saw a Colorado car loaded with  
women and camping gear with a "Bored?  
Try Women's Music" bumper sticker.

We tooted and waved and followed a  
growing string of similarly-laden  
cars all the way to the festival  
land. It was a wonderful high to  

see all those women, those dykes,

parading up the highway!

But then another reality hit.  
At the parking lot we were told  
the shuttles are not making com-  
plete runs as they did in past  
years. Instead of making pick-  
ups at the parking lot and trans-  
porting women to the camping area,  
they are picking women up at the  
registration booth about a quarter-  
mile in. Great. So it's a hike.  
Of course, Barb and I didn't pay  
any attention to weight or bulk  
when we packed. Luckily Meg did,  
and she depends  

never  

aaa  

with an empty backpack and some  
woman-power to help us truck all  
our gear in.

The festival is in a new place  
this year, so everyone is dis-  
oriented, even the veterans of all  
the previous festivals.

It took three hours, but we  
managed to get set up. We were  
hoping to connect up with Bette  
when we got to the festival so we  
could camp together and, to my  
amazement, we did. In fact, there's  
a little enclave of Buffalo people  
who gathered at the camp area called  
Jupiter Jumpoff.

11 p.m. at the Night Stage - Now,  
this is the music festival. Sitting  
in the night stage grounds surround-  
ed by women of every size, shape and  
color. They say there are 5,000  
women here already. Margie Adam was  
the first performer and began with  
her Unicorn Song. I was surprised.  
She's been doing that music for  
years. But later in the performance  
she added some newer pieces and some  
political talk about how important  
music and the music festival are in  
our lives. She is right. This  
festival has become legendary in the  
20th century lesbian culture. Lesb-  
ians in other parts of the country  
refer to the festival only as "Mich-  
igan", as if it were the only reason  
this state exists.

But the crowd is not terrifically  
responsive to Margie's talk, maybe  
because we've heard it before, maybe  
because it's so cold. There's talk  
of a frost in the northern regions  
of Michigan tonight. It's definite-  
ly going to be a night to zip your  
sleeping bag up to the top and  
cuddle down into it. The emcees  
suggest doubling or tripling (or  
whatever you're into) for warmth,

of course.

Sweet Honey In The Rock heat the  
crowd up a bit. They are billed as  
"unaccompanied voices of Black  
Womyn singing across a thousand  
years." They are about as poetic  
as that description, too, with the  
addition of lots of hand clappin',  
dancin' and jivin' to the concept  
of poetry.

It's about time for Jasmine.  
I've never heard them, but they are  
said to be good. They are a jazz/  
pop duo who are going to be accomp-  

anied by the Foot House Band.  
The set change is forever,  

though, and we are cold and tired,  
so we've decided to go back to the  

campsite and listen from there.

1 p.m. Friday, at the Merchants'  
Tents - Traveling is difficult  
around here. You make your way  
slowly through an enormous number  
of ferns. There are dirt foot paths  
and roadways both this year, a great  
improvement from last year when the  
foot traffic was in constant compe-  
tition with the vehicular traffic.  
However, the paths and roads are  
plagued with overpowering dust  
problems. Women are wearing  
scarves over their faces as they  
walk along. The workers wear surgi-  
cal face masks.

Earlier, Barb and I went to the  
merchant's tent, which is somewhat  
of a legend within the legend of the  
music festival. It is two enormous  
tents, as well as many outdoor  
booths of artworks, craftworks,  
books, clothing, records, regalia  
of all sorts. Here the lesbian can  
buy to her pocketbook's content and  
develop a terrific wish list once  
the money is gone. Where else can  
you not only find items that honor  
womanhood and lesbianism, but have  
choices?

4 p.m. Friday, at the Day Stage -  
The afternoon concert has just fini-  
shed and it was so moving. Dovido  
Ishatova played piano and spoke of  
the years of conflict she had had  
with her mother, who is a survivor  
of the Holocaust. It was a conflict  
of mother/daughter boundaries with  
the daughter feeling extreme pres-  
sure to live out the mother's fant-  
asy of being a concert pianist. The  
resolve, after years of struggle and  
self-examination was for them to  
perform together. So she introduced  
her mother, Henia Goodman, to the
