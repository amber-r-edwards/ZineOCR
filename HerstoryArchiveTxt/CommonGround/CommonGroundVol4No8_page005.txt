THE SECRET LIFE OF KEYS

by L. Hester Surncey

I keep my house keys and my car
keys on separate rings. Both sets
are kept on my bedside table. That
is where I put them and that is where
I expect to find them, dreamer that I
am. I have found these keys under
the bed, on the window sill behind
the curtains, in the kitchen on top
of the refrigerator, in the refrig-
erator, in the living room on the
floor behind the television set, in
the bathroom in the medicine cabinet;
and this you won't believe, but once
I found them in the closet in a pair
of boots I hadn't touched since last
winter. Keys not only have a life of
their own, they love to play tricks
on you. Never but never say aloud
to yourself, "I’m late, I've got to
get out of here." Your keys immedi-
ately disappear. Fifteen minutes
later after you've gotten dust on
your clean white blouse from crawling
around on the floor, your keys let
you find them in the first place you
looked, not the last. Then if you're
wise you will keep them tightly
clenched in your hot little hand
while you change into a fresh blouse.

You make it through the day, stop
at the grocery store, pick up clothes
at the cleaners. Knowing you have
both hands full, you put your keys in
your jacket pocket. Get to the door
and not only are they not in your
pocket, you don't seem to have them
at all. After contortions that would
put a double-jointed acrobat to shame,

HER THIGHS WERE FAT

by Suzanne Francisco

Her thighs were fat. She didn't
really look good in the black poly-
ester pants. The seams on the in-
side were pulling apart and the fa-
bric was worn thin where her thighs
rubbed together. The waistband was
tight around her middle. It hadn't
been like that before the three kids.
She sighed and pulled a faded blue
sweatshirt over her head. She looked
in the mirror that was over her
dresser. Her hair was mousy brown
with strands of grey. Ignoring what
she saw she bent over and opened a
drawer, selected two pairs of socks
--one thin and one thick--and put
them on. Grabbing her purse off the
nightstand she left her room and
went into her son's room. After
rummaging around on his desk she
found what she wanted and shoved
it into her purse.

Downstairs, she looked around
and thought of all the things she
should be doing. The breakfast
dishes were still on the kitchen
table; dirty laundry was piled up
on the bathroom floor; there was
dog hair all over the living room
rug. She decided it would all
still be there when she got back.
She pulled on her old boots and
coat, picked up her purse and
the case by the door, and walked
out.

Driving along she was struck by
the fact that there hadn't been any
sunshine in days. The streets were
slush-covered and the snow had most-
ly melted. She pulled into the
parking lot and shut off the engine.
Looking up at the sign on the big
white building she smiled for the
first time in days. She still
couldn't believe she was actually
doing this after so many years. She
locked the car and went in. While
paying the $1.50 admission fee she
heard the first strains of organ
music. She had always hated organ
music. There were only a few others
there. It didn't matter to
her.

She took off her coat and boots
and opened the case. It had been
a birthday present when she turned
sixteen. Sixteen was such a hopeful
age. The whole world was spread
before her then. There didn’t seem
to be any reason to plan ahead.
It was all there for her—anything
she wanted to do. So many possi-
bilities! She had felt so powerful
and strong then. She didn't know

you find your keys in the pocket of
the jacket under the plastic wrapper
in the raincoat you just picked up
from the cleaners. Impossible you
say, ha, just wait until it happens
to you. House keys are bad enough,
car keys are even worse.

You leave a friend's house alone
after dark. As you've seen on some
TV show, you hold the key ring in the
palm of your hand with the keys stick-
ing out between the fingers. Supposedly if you meet some mugger these
keys are going to turn into a deadly
instrument of self-protection. After
sprinting to your car, your keys jump
out of your hand onto the ground.
While stepping forward to pick them
up, you kick them under the car.
Hopefully any self-respecting mugger
who happens by will take you for in-
sane and pass you by while you tear
your last pair of stockings retriev-
ing your keys from under the car.

With the grace of God you arrive
home safely, put your keys on the bed-
side table. The next morning, you get
to your car after finding your keys
downstairs on the floor near the back
door and discover your tank which was
full the night before is down a quar-
ter of a tank. Remember whenever you
are out driving late at night and

think, "that driver is awfully short,
I can't even see the top of her/his
head.” Think again, there is no

driver in that car. It is a part

of the secret

what had happened to that girl in
the 20 years since that birthday.
It didn't seem to be anybody's
fault. Bobby had only increased
her sense of herself and all she
could be. He smiled so good and
felt so warm. Because he made her
feel so good she wanted to make
him happy in every way. Before
she knew it, he was her whole world.
Right after high school graduation
he joined the Army. When he left
for Nam he asked her to marry him.
How could she have said no?

She shivered in the big, drafty
room and pushed the thought from
her mind. She took the white roller
skates from the case where they had
lain unused for so many years. She
laughed to herself when she saw the
big orange pom poms on the toes.
She remembered the day she and her
girlfriend had made them. So long
ago. She pulled them on and laced
them up tight. At least her feet
hadn't gotten bigger along with
the rest of her. She stood up slow-
ly, scared of trying to get onto
the rink without falling down.
Quickly she sat back down again.
She had almost forgotten the Walkman
she had taken from her son‘s room.
She set the dial for a station that
played ‘classics’ from the ‘60s and
‘70s and adjusted the headphones
over her ears.

Getting up again she carefully
made her way onto the big, wooden
floor. She became conscious of
the song in her ears, one of her
favorites, Carole King. She pushed
off with her right foot. Push,
glide, right foot, left foot, push,
glide. "You make me feel, you make
me feel, you make me feel like a
Na-tur-al Wo-man..." It was all
coming back, the song was just the
right beat. Push, glide, right
foot, left foot. A new song was
coming on, another Carole King.
Must be a mini-concert, she thought.
"I feel the earth move, under my
feet...". Perfect for skating!

She started to pick up speed, sur-
prised at her own daring. She felt
light, free, exhilarated. She
started to hum along with the
music. "You've got to get up every
morning with a smile on your face/
and show the world all the love

in your heart/Then people gonna
treat you better/You're
