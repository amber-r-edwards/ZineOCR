grandmother, who died a few months  
after her 97th birthday, kept her on  
a journal. More a datebook, the

work and became a popular,  
mature, babysitter who needed to  
keep a calendar. After she stopped  
babysitting she continued to write  
down what happened in her days, what  
was important to her. She wrote for  
herself. I have chosen to share her  
words -- and these are hers exactly,  
I have added only a title and num-

favorite TV shows are obvious. The  
piece that follows covers the last  
five entries in her journal approx-  
imately 6 months before her death. When we were small  
We lived in different cities,  
But we rode our trikes,  

and drank orange soda, and listened to Elvis wail.

When we turned ten  

We took a bus downtown,  
And ate boiled hot dogs  
Celebrating our July birthday in a cheap tearoom.  

We heard a Robin sing

When we became teens  
We drove a V.W. bug  
Behind grocery store walls  

Taste-testing beer in bottles and cans.

When we turned twenty-one  

We flew off in planes  
Refining obsessions academically  
For oysters, fine crystal, and wine.  

When we were thirty  

We lived in different cities,  

But we lost touch, picking up trikes,  

Pouring orange soda, and listening to our wails.
