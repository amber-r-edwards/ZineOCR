In the first place, despite our very  
different identities and backgrounds  
- white Christian-raised Southerner  
(Minnie Bruce Pratt), Afro-American  
(Barbara Smith), Ashkenazi Jew  
(Elly Bulkin). Each of us speaks  
only for herself, and we do not  
necessarily agree with each other.  
Yet we believe our cooperation on  
this book indicates concrete  
possibilities for coalition work.
