“Lost” Women Psychologists

By Christine Davis

About 28 American women - the
first generation to either receive
a Ph.D. in psychology or membership
in the American Psychological Asso-

ciation - are the focus of a biograph-

ical book in progress by Dr. Eliza-
beth Scarborough, chairwoman of the
Fredonia State College psychology
department, and Dr. Laurel Furumoto,
professor of psychology at Wellesley
College in Massachusetts.

"We really want to speak to young
women, and have them see these role
models, and who their foremothers
were," Dr. Scarborough said.

In spite of the fact that some
of the 28 women earned distinguished
reputations, matching those of many
men at the time, their names have
failed to survive in the descendant
psychological textbooks, which rare-
ly, if ever, refer to them or their
research, Dr. Scarborough said.

"These women have become lost,
they aren't mentioned anymore,"
she said.

"We're especially interested in
trying to see what their personal
experiences were. What went on?

"We want to try and look at the
whole group as much as we can so
that we're not just focusing on the
outstanding women. And we see two
patterns here. The thing which seems
to distinguish them the most is
whether they decided to marry or
not," Dr. Scarborough said.

"The only ones who had stable
careers were the women who did not

group did a child study on her
brother's infant for her disserta-
tion which became a classic. "But
after she completed her degree, she
went back and lived with his family
on a ranch in California and never
did anything else in psychology,"
Dr. Scarborough said.

The exploratory work of the
authors has taken them to libraries
across the country! "Some of our
subjects have become so lost, we
virtually can't find anything about
them. We've gone to archives at
colleges and universities and we've
examined the letters and correspon-
dence of men in the field that they
would have been writing to," she
said.

For a few of the women, however,
there are some rich papers, and the
authors have examined diaries and
autobiographies, as well as inter-
viewed former students and acquain-
tances of the 28 women.

Not yet titled, the book will be
published by Columbia University
Press. Dr. Scarborough is taking
a sabbatical leave this year to
finish writing it.

County native with a B.A. in jour-
nalism from Marquette University.

What were they thinking about? Why
did they make these decisions?
What were they wrestling with? That's
what makes our research so interest-
ing, but also so difficult," she
said.

Discrimination was probably the
mark of their collective exper-
iences, but the psychology professor
at Fredonia, who is a strong advo-
cate of women's rights said, "It's
career alive, but they were unable to
put together anything of a stable
nature. And then a few of them,
even after receiving a doctorate,
got married and did absolutely
nothing with their degree." In fact,
one of the best known women of the
SUNY at Fredonia, she was public
information coordinator for Chau-
tauqua County Executive Joseph Gerace.

discrimination or deliberate mean-
ness. You have to see it in the
context of the turn of the 20th cen-

“That context forced women out of
Membership in some professional or-
ganizations, separated them from their
male colleagues during meetings when
it came time for the "smoker", de-
nied them doctoral degrees even when
they had completed the work, and made
it impossible for them to teach and
be married at the same time. 
Harvard University, for example,
would not give doctoral degrees to
women Ph.D. students, but in 1902,
Radcliffe College began granting doc-
toral degrees to women who had done
all the work at Harvard. 

The sentiments were mixed. Many pe-
ople were sympathetic to their women
colleagues, and some institutions be-
came pioneers by granting Ph.D. de-
grees to women. While faculty rank
was frequently denied to married wo-
men, there were institutions who
would eagerly let them teach as adjunct
lecturers. The American Psychological
Association admitted women to its
professional membership, and even
elected two of these 28 women to be
its president, in 1905 and 1921 (Dr.
Scarborough wryly points out it was
another 50 years before APA elected
another woman president - as a result
of the women's movement started in
the 1960s, she believes).

Perseverance was another hallmark of
the 28 women's collective exper-
iences, but after they completed
their education their directions and
objectives became diverse and, some-
times, contradictory.
