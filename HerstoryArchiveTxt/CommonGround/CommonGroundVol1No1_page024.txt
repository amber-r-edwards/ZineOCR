The following speech by ERA
spokeswoman Sonia Johnson was
sponsored by the Chautauqua Insti-
tution on August 6.

"In the Women's Movement," noted
Sonia Johnson, "I couldn't help
feeling uneasy that the (Mormon)
Church was opposing something with
a name as beautiful as the Equal
Rights Amendment."

To her, the words sounded
beautiful enough to suffer excom-
munication from her church in 1979,
for actively supporting ERA. This
she explained, came after 42 years
of considering herself a deeply
religious woman, having been
raised in a family where God was
very loved and very respected.

recalled Johnson, 46, "when I
realized what the Women's Movement
was all about and where women
really stand in this culture."

The anger that followed her fem-
inist awakening was at “having
been duped so easily for so long."

Johnson believes that the
(Mormon) Church denies women their
own experiences, denies what they
can see with their own eyes, be-
cause the voice of God (referring
to clergy and Mormon leaders)
keeps telling women they are not
oppressed.

She described some of the anti-
ERA rhetoric. "Some people tell
me women are more equal than men,
but women have never had it so

"wonderful to be a woman.” But, Johns é
noted, as the "pro-woman" rhetoric
rises and places women on pede-
stals, the rights of women be-

come restricted. "Pedestals," she
warned, "are the pits.”
She gave a few reasons why it's

not so wonderful to be a woman in
the U.S.:

*In 1961, women earned 61¢ for
every dollar a man made, but today
the figure is 59¢.

*Of 28 million Americans living
in official poverty, 24 million
are women and children.

*President Reagan has shown his
"support" for women by trimming
and/or reviewing federally funded
programs, including food stamps,
Aid to Dependent Children, Title
IX, Affirmative Action and CETA.

She said the (Mormon) Church
has limited women to serving as
"man's helpmate" by telling fe-
males to be sweet, gentle and
meek, to make men feel good, and
not to give men any trouble. "Be-
cause God is portrayed as male,"
she added, "women have learned
that to please God, they must
first please men, those closest to
them."

“...No one ever deceived men into
believing if they would just be nicer and

nicer, someone would give them some
power.”

She discussed frustration that
some women have been convinced if
they sit and wait patiently, ERA
will inevitably be passed. Said
Johnson: "No one ever deceived
men into believing if they would
just be nicer and nicer, someone
would give them some power."

She has been criticized for
publicly admitting she would die
fighting for ERA and for being one

of several women to fast during

the final push before the ERA

deadline. "When we have a nation-
al holiday and celebrate a man's

birthday," she argued, "it is u-
sually for a man who would have
given his life, or did so, for his
fellow men." When Patrick Henry
said 'Give me liberty or give me
death,' no one said that was a
little immodest or extreme."

“...When Patrick Henry said ‘Give me

liberty or give me death,’ no one said
that was a little immodest or extreme.”

In 1978, she marched (for an
extension on time to ratify ERA)
with about 20 Mormons. The New

Times "Mormons for
ERA? Isn't that a little like
astronauts for a flat earth?"

According to Johnson, Mormons
for ERA became a national organi-
zation after her much publicized
exchange with Utah Senator Orrin
Hatch (a Mormon) during a Senate
Sub-Committee hearing on Consti-
tutional Rights.

Johnson said her family was
very supportive during the excom-
munication, which coincided with
her divorce, although she main-
tains the two are not directly
connected.

She recalled one week last year
when she was arrested at a demon-
stration. The next day, her
youngest son's teacher asked each
student to speak about his/her
family. When it was his turn, he
said, "I come from an ERA family
and my mom's in jail."

or the expertise to direct the dis-
ability-related health care needs of
patients. These physicians refer
their patients to specialists for
this care.

A specialist, on the other hand, is
not likely to be the healthcare pro-
vider to turn to for non-disability-
related illnesses or accidents. Co-

appropriate care.

ATTITUDE AND ACCESSIBILITY

The attitude of, and accessibili-
ty to, your health-care provider can
make the difference.

Maureen Deneke, a peer counselor
at the WNY Independent Living Project
in Buffalo, said in our interview:

"Health-care for disabled people is
not as good as for non-disabled
people." Referring to health-care for
the disabled in WNY, she continued:
"Hospital clinics, like the Erie
County Medical Center, see people with
disabilities on an out-patient basis.
Many people have specialists, but no
private family doctors. Offices are
not accessible."

The Independent Living Project, a
disabled consumer-run center which
advocates independent living and the
ability to do that for disabled
people, is currently conducting a
survey of Western New York private
physicians' offices in order to make
physicians more aware of the need for
accessibility and to compile a list of
accessible offices for disabled people.
Ms. Deneke stressed that changes in
Section 504 pertaining to new
building accessibility can deny the
best of health care to a mobility-
impaired person if she/he cannot get
into the building. (Bear in mind that
most people are disabled at some point
in their lives, whether because of an
accident, age, or a permanent dis-
ability. Accessibility to buildings,
especially government, health and
service buildings, is an issue for
everyone.)

As advocates for the disabled, the
Independent Living Project supports
that all public buildings should be
made and maintained accessible.
Choice of health-care providers should
be based on those who are accessible, rather than
free choice of the best and most

The lack of transportation to
health care can also limit the qual-
ity of care. If a woman is ill and
cannot drive because of her disability,
cannot find someone to take her, or
cannot take the bus or afford a taxi,
she may forego treatment. While many
poor women, or women who do not live
near public transportation face some
of these same barriers, it is doubly
hard for the woman who is confined to
her home because she is mobility im-
paired. If a woman is Medicaid
eligible, she may be able to get free
transportation and should take advan-
tage of this service. Inquire at your
Medicaid service office or call the
Independent Living Project for
further information.

HEALTH CARE AND WORK

Until a few years ago, if a Medi-
caid/Medicare recipient went back to
work, she lost her medical benefits
as soon as her income rose above a
certain level. As often as not, the
wages earned, or medical benefits of
the job, were insufficient to cover
her disability-related medical costs.
This situation risked the health of
the disabled worker and created a dis-
incentive to work.

There is now a new trial work
period of nine months during which
health-care benefits are maintained
until it is determined that the new
job provides adequate wages and
benefits, and that the job is appro-
priate for the worker. A disabled
woman who would like to return to
work but is afraid to try because of
loss of benefits should call her
caseworker or Medicaid/Medicare office
and inquire about this program.
