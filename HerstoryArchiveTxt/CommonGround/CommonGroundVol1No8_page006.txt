Revenge of the FATWOMAN

by Madame XL

THE FATWOMAN COMETH  
10:20 a.m., August 3, 1981

The revolution started on a  
summer day that was so hot you  
could fry an egg on the sidewalk,  
or the driver's seat of your car,  
for that matter. Life was bear-  
able only in an air-conditioned  
suburban shopping mall, and that  
was precisely where Polly S. Derr  
was headed.  

She was in a rotten mood. Plastic money in hand, she  
made a beeline for the local fat  
lady's store, Lane Giant. She  
had a wedding to go to, and as we  
all know, there is nothing that  
makes a fat lady surlier than  
having to shop for a dress for a  
wedding. (Though perhaps going  
to the wedding ranks a close  
second.)

THE CHASE  
10:33 a.m.

Adele Adipose, career sales-  
lady for Lane Giant Inc., started  
to follow Polly S. Derr at a dis-  
creet distance the moment she  
entered the store (as a former  
CIA agent, Adele made the ideal  
commissioned saleslady). Our  
heroine was no stranger to this  
game, however, and ducked into a  
nearby rack of tiger-striped jump-  
suits, where she took cover until  
Adele found another unsuspecting  
customer to tail.

In the meantime, Polly began  
to shop in earnest. She plowed  
through rack upon rack of tent  
dresses, stretchy plastic plaid  
pants, lime-green business  
suits, and all manner of huge garments  
with ruffles and flounces attached,  
like vestigial organs, in the most  
unlikely places. She didn't rec-  
ognize any of the designer  
labels either: "Chubette",  
"Fat-n-Sassy", "Bodices by  
Bertha" or "Squeeze into This".  
Finally, she found the perfect  
ensemble—quality material, well  
cut, and not too expensive. Size  
10. Oops. Her frustration be-  
gan to mount.

Adele Adipose was no quitter.  
After intimidating her hapless  
customer into buying a yellow  
pantsuit, she established a  
stake-out on the unsuspecting  
Polly, who was becoming more  
and more frantic. (She was one  
of those unfortunate individuals;  
a fat woman with good taste.)

IN FOR THE KILL  
10:58 a.m.

In the dressing room with four  
or five not-quite-mediocre out-  
fits, Polly started to peel off  
her clothes, deliberately averting  
her eyes to avoid the triple mir-  
rors and glaring fluorescent  
lights, that always gave her skin  
such a bilious purple cast from  
three equally unflattering an-  
gles. Just as she had gotten  
down to the bra and panties stage,  
the curtain flew open, and good  
old Adele, with a fiendish gleam  
in her eye, brayed triumphantly,  
"HOW ARE WE DOING IN HERE?"

SOMETHING SNAPPED  
10:58 a.m.

She had never intended to  
live a life of crime. She was a  
solid (indeed) citizen, and a  
bio-chemist. But she was a fat  
woman who had been pushed TOO  
FAR. It was at that moment that  
Polly S. Derr became...THE FAT-  
WOMAN.

THE PLOT  
2:43 p.m.

Back in her apartment the  
FATWOMAN was fashioning a bomb.  
No ordinary bomb, but an entirely  
new, fiendish type of explosive  
of her own invention.  

COFFEE  
GROUNDS __.

By The Common Grind Collective ~

A carbon-  
(For all you fat  
women with a few bones to pick  
with society, here is the for-  
mula: 1 hot plate, 1 lava lamp,  
32 cases of Diet Pepsi. Turn the  
hot plate on, and place 1 six-  
pack on it. Line up all the  
other six packs. Get mellow  
watching the lava lamp. In about  
10 minutes, the Pepsi will ex-  
plode, setting off a chain re-  
action throughout all 72 cans of  
pop. Makes a nice loud noise.)

THE NEXT DAY  
LI715 - pens

In Lane Giant's storeroom,  
Adele Adipose was busy unpacking  
a shipment of leather-look disco  
pants when the phone rang. "Good  
morning!" she chirped, "Lane Giant,  
where blubber is our business!"

A menacing voice hissed, "I'd  
clear out the store if I were you.  
I'm going to make some alterations  
on your inventory. You have ten  
minutes before the bomb goes off,"  
she added.

There was panic and general  
hysteria, and a stampede rivaling  
the dinosaur scene in Fantasia  
when the customers were informed  
of the situation. Approximately  
9 and a half minutes later, a  
violent fizzing was heard, and  
in another minute, Lane Giant was  
blown to kingdom-come in a foaming,  
syrupy, polyester mess.
