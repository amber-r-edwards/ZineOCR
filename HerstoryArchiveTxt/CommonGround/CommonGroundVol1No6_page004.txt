Dear Common Ground:

There may be a lot of small press  
by and for women in the Buffalo area  
but thank you for putting out a  
paper that's more generally access-  
ible and varied in scope.

On page 3 in "A Feminist Look At  
Women In Art" by Marilyn Patterson,  
Norine Spurling in an interview  
stated..."The Albright-Knox has no  
women artists in its permanent  
collection." This is simply not  
true. Although but a handful of  
“modern" artists are represented,  
the museum has these: (the permanent  
collection is only on view in part,  
two-thirds get rotated in and out of  
storage) --one (small) Georgia  
O'Keeffe, one Helen Frankenthaler,  
one Sonia Delaunay, one Berthe Mori-  
sot, one "Nikki", one Judy Pfaff  
(recently acquired), one Bridget  
Riley, one Lee Krasner, one Grace  
Hartigan, one Joan Mitchell, one  
Chryssa, two Marisol, three Louise  

Nevelson.- (At any one time half  
of these will be on display). Granted  
it might seem like tokenism -- but  

then these women artists have too  
much repute for the museum to —  
either!

For those who would like to view  
more: There are four excellent slide  
sets of visual artists' work entitled  
"Women and Art" in the Library's  
instructional learning center at  
Buffalo State College, with accom-  
panying manuals, that correspond to  
a book by Karen Peterson and J.J.  
Wilson --Women and Art: Recognition  
and Reappraisal (Colophon Paperbacks,  
Harper and Row $6.95) There are also  

eight excellent films (no charge for  
rental) from the downtown public  
library. “The Originals in Art"  
series by the American Federation of  
Arts includes one generalized film,  
"Anonymous Was A Woman", and in-  
dividual films on: Louise Nevelson,  
Helen Frankenthaler, Betty Saar,  
"Grandma Moses", Mary Cassatt and

Dear Sisters:

I must express my delight in the  
December issue of Common Ground -  
which is, incidentally, my first  
issue. The articles, letters, news  
notes -- everything was a pleasure  
to read, and more importantly, nec-  
essary to read. Thank you for your  
hard work.

This is not just a fan letter,  
though. I would like to request a  
style sheet for submissions to the  
journal. At this point, I am not  
sure just what I could contribute,  
but there are several ideas forming,  
and I know that having an outlet  
for them will help them grow and  
develop...

..-Enough for now. I'm eagerly  
looking forward to hearing from you.  
Again, thank you for being there.

Sincerely,

Dianne Mann

(Ed. note: Thank you Dianne and all  
the others who have asked for a  

style sheet and info about Common  
Ground. Our style sheet needed major  
revisions, and so was out of print  
for a while. We also have a new info  
sheet, for those who want to know  

a little about how we operate, and  
how one joins this great group of  
women who put out CG. (Even if we  

do say so ourselves!) For those who  
asked for one ages ago, you'll get  
it soon. We are always looking for  
articles, news items, graphics etc.,  
and women to work on the paper. If  
you have the urge to help us publish,  
write for a style sheet or info.)

Georgia O'Keeffe. (The latter two  
being quite good). There is also  
a very good film on the making of  
Judy Chicago's "The Dinner Party".

I know this because we did a  
"Women In Art" series at the North  
Area Y.W.C.A. this past fall.

Sincerely,

Joan Van de Water

(Ed. note: Ms. Spurling has pointed  
out that she was misquoted about the  
presence of women in the permanent  
collection. Our thanks to Joan for  
sharing the facts and resources on  
women artists!)

Dear Editor:  
If it is true that we grow from  
our experiences - I am a giant today  
- thanks to those who gave me the op-  

portunity and privilege to serve  
these past two years as a New York  
State Assemblywoman.

Obviously I am disappointed in  
losing the election, but I won the  
sense of satisfaction in knowing I  
tried my best and did everything I  
could to win.

Being a Republican in an over-  
whelmingly Democratic district was  
not that much of an obstacle to  
winning until reapportionment com-  
pounded the problem. Reality then  
dictated the outcome.

I am deeply grateful to the thous-  
ands who voted for me displaying  
their confidence in my direct, honest  

and open approach to government while  

confronting issues head-on.

Words are inadequate to express my  
true feelings to those loyal support-  
ers and campaign workers who devoted  
such tireless energy on my behalf.

Please be assured that this elec-  
tion will not diminish my faith in  
it. It will serve to motivate  

me to continue to serve.

Member of Assembly

Dear Editor:

I read with interest your superb  
publication directed toward women of  
all ages. As Co-director of a very  
unique program designed particularly  
for middle and later aged women, I  
am writing this letter to familiarize  
you with CARERS (Caregivers Assistance  
and Resources for the Elderly's Rel-  
atives Series)...

My colleague, Dr. Carol Nowak, and  
I are the authors and trainers for  
CARERS...We developed and implemented  
a skills-building training program  
for family members ... and since  
September 1981, we have offered all  
twelve of our workshop topics, at-  
tracting over three hundred different family  
members.

Our philosophy incorporates ed-  
ucation as a primary mental health  
intervention for the caregiver and  
as a secondary intervention for the  
care receiver. We view "knowledge as  
power" with CARERS empowering the  
caregiver to be an educated consumer  
advocate, a skilled caregiver and  
family member able to cope with the  
stresses and pressures that result  
from the caregiving role. To our  
knowledge, we are the only program  
that actively deals with the sig-  
nificant issues of caregiving/care-  
receiving -- the issues of mental  
health in a familial context. It  
is this difference, that we believe,  
accounts for the tremendous com-  
munity and professional response  
that CARERS has received since  
September.

A good majority of our train-  
ees are middle-aged women caught in  
the squeeze between generations.

Dear Editors of Common Ground:  
"Woman, as well as men, think  

Reagan is a sweet guy. It's only as  

President that they have their doubts  

about him"-- or so stated Zick Rubin  
in Psychology Today.  
-CG News, Dec. p.11

This little blurb from your De-  
cember issue: “Women as well as men  
think Reagan is a sweet guy." REALLY  
had me upset. BELIEVE ME, there  
are PLENTY of women and men who know  
that Reagan is ANYTHING but a really  
"sweet guy". There is an old saying  
"People will forgive a man anything  
as long as he is charming."

Actions speak louder than any  
sort of hypocritical or seemingly  
pleasant "charm". Reagan has done  
more to hurt more people in this  
country and in foreign countries  
than any president in recent history.  
He is racist -- he has allowed greed  
and callousness -- he is a hawk.

He is NO SWEET GUY. If the devil  
himself was charming or an old  
movie star, would you listen to  
him? The man is actually quite  
terrible -- deliberately doing what  
he is doing, and incompetent to boot!  
What is Common Ground saying?  
Sincerely,  
Joan Van de Water

Dear Common Ground Staff:

The Deaconess Family Planning  
Center wishes to announce that the  
Women's Resource Directory is avail-  
able free of charge. (Single copies  
available.) There is a listing of  
approximately 300 agencies that pri-  
marily serve women of Metropolitan  
Buffalo. For your free copy call  
Deaconess Family Planning Center,  
and Courtney.

Sincerely,

Sandra Courtney  
Education Coordinator  

Deaconess Family Planning Center

requiring assistance. It is a fact  
that women are most often called on  
to [take care of elderly relatives]  
and although most will meet the  
challenge, it is not without stress,  
anxiety and frustration. CARERS...  
[gives] hands-on skills development  
and advocacy.

We are...training those who  
care for older adults while at the  
same time improving the family  
system's intergenerational problems.  
We know that 85% of all services to  
the elderly are given by the family  
but not without its toll. The CARERS  
program is a sophisticated yet cost-  
effective effort to improve the  
service network and help fam-  
ilies to cope with the responsibili-  
ties they now assume and will increas-  
ingly assume as social service [fund-  
ing] cuts continue. I think it is  
fair to say that our program has al-  
ready made a significant impact in  
the Western New York area and is  
growing in numbers on a monthly  
basis.

We offer one 2 1/2 hour workshop  
per month...Each session is $5 per  
person and telephone registration  
is advised.

Thanks for your assistance.

Sincerely,

Gary C. Brice, ACSW
