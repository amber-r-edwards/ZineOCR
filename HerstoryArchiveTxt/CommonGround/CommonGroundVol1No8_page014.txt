Myths and misunderstandings con-
cerning herpes are circulating and
are preventing people from obtaining
proper diagnosis and reliable treat-

ment. A correct understanding of the
facts about herpes is the first step
in managing your own herpes and in
accepting and helping others who have
herpes.

Herpes simplex is a virus that in-
vades, reproduces and lives inside the
cell. Although there are many strains
of herpes virus, the main types are
herpes simplex virus I and II (HSV I,
HSV II). HSV I is commonly associated
with a recurring disease, usually on
the lips and sometimes in the eyes,
nose and occasionally on other parts
of the body, even the genitals. HSV
II is slightly (microscopically) dif-
ferent from HSV I, but presents basic-
ally the same symptoms as HSV I. HSV
II is often contracted after a person
becomes sexually active because it
primarily affects the genitals.

SPREADING HERPES

Herpes virus I or II will affect
only the area where the virus init-
ially enters the body. It will not
spread internally to other sites. For

example, herpes on the lip (cold sores,
fever blisters) cannot re-emerge on
its own on the genitals or elsewhere.
However, a person can contract new
herpes infections on other areas of
the body:

1) by spreading the virus from ex-
isting active sites: for example,
touching your active lip herpes and
then putting your fingers to your eyes,
genitals, or other susceptible areas.

2) by having oral sex performed
by a person with active lip herpes.

3) by having sexual relations
with a person with active genital
herpes.

4) by touching an active herpes
lesion on another person and then
touching susceptible areas on your
body.

For the majority of those with
herpes, the virus is present and
being shed from the time of the early
signs of an outbreak (prodromal per-
iod), throughout the time blisters
are present, until the time the
blisters have dried and disappeared.
This is the major period of contagion
when high concentrations of the virus
are present and being shed.

TOILET SEATS

Recent reports that herpes can be
spread by being present on toilet
seats are, for all practical purposes,
unfounded. In a laboratory experiment,
herpes virus was shown to live 1 to
4 hours on a toilet seat. Media cov-
erage has sensationalized these re-
sults. One of the designers of the
study, Dr. Trudy Larson, set the rec-
ord straight in a recent interview.
She stated, "I don't feel public
toilets constitute a public health
hazard... We did not set out to, nor
did we scientifically prove that HSV
infection from contact with these
surfaces was possible. In fact, trans-
mission in this manner is highly un-
likely."

Facts For Women About Herpes

SYMPTOMS

An initial episode of (genital)
herpes displays itself in the form of
small clusters of blister-like lesions
on the genitals. In a woman they usu-
ally are on the external areas (vulva,
labia and near the rectum). In some
cases the lesions are seen in the va-
gina and on the cervix. The blisters
first are itchy and warm, they become
very painful when they open and a
crater in the tissue is formed. Then
they usually crust over and have a
white-yellow tip surrounded by a red
ring. They remain tender. The lymph
glands in the groin area are swollen
and tender. There is usually a vagin-
al discharge. The woman feels like
she has the flu: tired, low grade
temperature, joint aches, headache.
These symptoms can last from one to
three weeks.

After an initial attack the herpes
virus becomes latent and retreats to
the nerve ganglion near the spine.
When a woman becomes stressed, under-
goes a hormone change (such as before
menstruation) or if she becomes nu-
tritionally deficient, she may ex-

perience a recurrence of herpes. The

recurrences usually are not as severe as
the first attack. (This is because
her body's immune system is learning
to protect itself from the virus.)

Any succeeding occurrences are usu-
ally preceded by prodromal or early
symptoms: burning sensations along
the area of the nerve ending (that
tells the woman that the herpes virus
is moving along the nerve to the sur-
rounding tissue) and redness and itch-
ing at the outbreak site. These pro-
dromal or early symptoms are a warning
signal that "herpes is coming."

The course of a herpes infection is
highly individualized. The initial
outbreak usually occurs within 2 to 20
days after contact. The severity of
this outbreak varies greatly: from
great discomfort in some, to a lack of
obvious symptoms in others (especially
if lesions are present on the cervix).
Subsequent outbreaks also vary in
severity. The frequency of outbreaks
depends largely on the individual's
general susceptibility (including her/
his natural immune system) and ability
to make lifestyle adjustments (nutri-
tion, stress, etc.).

HERPES: DIAGNOSIS

Reliable and affordable diagnostic
techniques for herpes are available in
the Buffalo area. NOTE: Active her-
pes blisters (lesions) must be present
for accurate diagnosis (except for
blood test).

1. VISUAL EXAMINATION: highly
reliable provided that the examiner is
experienced.

2. PAP SMEAR: sample is taken
from the site of the lesion and examined for
presence of herpes virus. Reliable
and reasonably priced method of diag-
nosis for women.

3. LAB CULTURE: sample is taken
from the lesion and "grown" in special
medium. Highly reliable.

4. ELECTRON MICROSCOPY: sample
is taken from the lesion and examined
under high-powered electron micro-
scope. Highly reliable, although ex-
pensive. Recommended for accurate
testing during pregnancy.

5. BLOOD TEST: can demonstrate
that antibodies (germ fighters) have
formed in response to a herpes virus
and are present in your blood. Blood
test results indicate only that at
some time in your life you were ex-
posed to a herpes virus.

HERPES: MEASURES FOR PREVENTION

1. Do not have sexual relations with
anyone having active herpes.
("active herpes" means from the
time the person feels the prodromal
or early signs of an outbreak,
throughout the time the blisters
are present, until the time the
blisters have dried and disap-
peared. High concentrations of herpes
virus are being shed during all
this time.)

2. Wash your hands after touching
any active herpes infection.

3. Question your partner about herpes.
If necessary, examine his/her
genitals and mouth.

4. Avoid oral sex with a partner who
has a cold sore (cold sores or
fever blisters are caused by a
herpes virus). Do not perform
oral sex on your partner if you
have a cold sore.

5. Wash your genital area after sex-
ual relations. (Do not douche.)

6. Urinate before and after sexual
relations.

7. Require that your male partner use
a condom. (While a condom is not
a guaranteed safeguard against
herpes transmission, it is still a
recommended precaution.)

8. Examine your health habits: poor
nutrition, fatigue, stress, chronic
illness can render you more sus-
ceptible to herpes infection if
you are exposed.

9. Examine your lifestyle: frequent
short-term or one-time sexual
contacts increase your risk of ex-
posure to herpes virus.

10. Accept responsibility for your
health: know the facts about
herpes transmission and take the
necessary precautions.
