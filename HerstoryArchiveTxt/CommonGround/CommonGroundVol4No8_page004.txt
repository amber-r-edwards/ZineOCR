YWCA Annual Meeting  
by Kay Patterson  

“Our differences are our greatest  
strength" was the message YWCA World  
Council President Ann Northcote  
brought to the 116th annual meeting  
of the Buffalo YWCAs on March 1st.  

Ms. Northcote has spent more than  
two years seeing those differences  
as she travels around the world vi-  
siting YWCAs and promoting the Y's  
"Soromundi" (sisters of the world)  
theme.  

To those gathered at the Hearth-  
stone Manor in Depew, she described  
YWCAs in Uganda, where 1,000 people  
traveled for the 30th anniversary  
celebration. Many came on foot, she  
said, walking for the entire day  
prior to the event to celebrate an  
organization that teaches coopera-  
tive farming methods to women, who  
are the nation's agricultural work-  
ers.  

She spoke of YWCA members in Gei-  
rut, Lebanon, who were busy finding  
food and beds for the homeless follow-  
ing the bombing of the U.S. embassy,  
which had immediately preceded Ms.  
Northcote's visit.  

She spoke of a YW in India that  
operates a Girls' Town for homeless  
girls and provides a literacy pro-  
gram for women in the slums of an  
Indian city.  

She also told about a YWCA in  
Bangladesh that was supported by  
funds from a European agency. When  
the agency demanded the YW give up  
some of its programs in favor of  
more profitable ones, the Board of  
the YW refused the money. Even in  
this, one of the poorest countries  
of the world, she said, they would  
rather find local money and keep  
programs built in response to local  
need than build programs based on  
European funders' ideas of profita-  
bility.  

That, Ms. Northcote said, is the  
spirit of the YWCA - providing pro-  
grams in local areas that respond to  
the unique needs of women in that  
area and linking those women to the  
larger network of YWCA women around  
the world.  

Buffalo YWCA officials honored  
Edith G. Robinson for her many years  
of volunteer work. Ms. Robinson  
has served three terms as President  
of the local YWCA.  

Lakeshore Women's Services Awards  

The Lakeshore Women's Services  
Coalition held its achievement awards  
ceremony on International Women's  
Day, March 8, in Fredonia. Nine  
county women were honored by the  
group, which solicits nominations  
from the public.  

The individual awards, and the  
outstanding women who received them,  
follow. The Debbie Thomas Special  
Student Award went to Joanne Amodeo  
for her student leadership at Fre-  
donia State; the Elnora Babcock  
Working Homemaker Award to Cheryl  
Ann Baker of Jamestown, who has ex-  
panded her family concerns into  
strong community involvement; the  

Kate Peate Working Woman Award to  
Katrien Vervisch for her work in  
establishing Dunkirk's soup kitchen,  
initiating a feminist reading group,  
and her dedication to volunteer  
groups. The Anne Bernstein Com-  
munications Award went to Judy Lis-  
ciandro for her Post-Journal series  
on a rape case, which has resulted  
in a drive to strengthen existing  
rape laws. The Calista Jones Award  
for Advancing the Rights of Women  
was presented to Judy Calarco, the  
director of the Displaced Homemaker  
Center.  

There were two “doubled” awards.  
There is a new Children's Services  
Award, which went to Judy Mayo and  
Phylia Kohl in a tie. Ms. Mayo is  
Director of WIC, which serves 6,000  
children and pregnant women annually,  
and is active in many groups dedicated  
to the welfare of women and their  
children. Ms. Kohl has been Director  
of a Head Start program since 1967, ini-  
tiated a Migrant Day Care program, is  
an educational instructor and consul-  
tant, and has recently established an  
Adolescent Pregnancy Program.  

The Caroline Skinner Twing Com-  
munity Service Award went to two  
women for their joint project, the  
establishment of a Creative Play-  
ground. Mary Croxton and Carol  
Schiralli recruited donations of  
labor, time, material and funds to  
complete the playground, which was —  
presented to the Fredonia School  
District.  

Funds raised at the Awards Cere-  
mony and reception will be shared  
by the Chautauqua Day Care Project,  
Inc.; Amicae, Inc. (the hotline for  
rape and battering); Northern Chau-  
taugua NOW's Legal Fund; and Stu-  
dent Parents Interested in Education.

A recent survey for Planned Parent-  
hood indicated 80% of Western New York-  
ers favored inclusion of birth control  
information in sex education classes  
in public and 75% believe preventing  
teenage pregnancy should be a priority  
for public schools.  

New York City's City Council, March  

21, adopted a bill barring discrimina-  

tion against homosexuals in housing,  

employment and public accommodations.  

The bill had been defeated for 15  

years in a row.  

New York is the 51st city (including  
Buffalo) to pass such a bill. It is  

estimated to have the largest gay pop-  

ulation in the nation.  

Opposition to the bill was led by  
some Catholic and Jewish leaders.  
Cardinal John O'Connor issued a state-  
ment decrying the vote moments after  
it was approved.

CRIMES AGAINST WOMEN  

March 10: Police arrested a suspect  
after a woman told them she was raped  
and sodomized by a man with a butcher  
knife. She said she opened the door  
of her East Side apartment at 6:00  
a.m. to see who was knocking.  

March 17: Police arrested 4 suspects  
for robbery of a woman in Garden Vil-  
lage apartments. The woman said two  
men knocked at her door and then forced  
their way inside, taking a stereo, TV  
and VCR. Two men were arrested who  
were accused of waiting in a getaway  
car.  

March 18: James E. McDaniel was or-  
dered to serve a prison term of 17 to  
32 years for the rape of an 18-year-  
old Black Rock woman. He had previously  
served six years for robbery and  

sex crimes. McDaniel also robbed the  
victim of 19¢ and food stamps. The  
prosecutor urged the maximum term of  

20 to 40 years, calling it “necessary  
for the protection of society.”  

A 15-year-old girl was held  
captive for seven hours, slapped around,  
raped by two men, taken to an alley and  
raped by two other men. She had been

A Fond Farewell  
To A Special Friend  

It is with regret that we offer  
farewell and best wishes to Lee  
Lyons, Executive Director of the  
Buffalo YWCA. Her several years

munity - represented an unparal-  
leled outreach to women, and  
an apex in networking in the  
broadest and finest sense. As we  
wish her well in her new position,  
we will sorely miss Lee as a friend  
to us all.
