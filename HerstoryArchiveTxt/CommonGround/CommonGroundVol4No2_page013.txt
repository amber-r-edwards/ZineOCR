WE NEED YOU!!! CG is here as access  
to the community for ideas, analysis,  
communication...and more. If you are  
waiting for an in-depth analysis of  
your favorite cause, latest book you  
read, or a social phenomenon, you  
might have to wait a long time--  
because we are here to give you access  
to others, not necessarily to write  
all the articles, cover all the  
events, review all the books. We are  
a very small group of people, and we  
desperately need your help.  
news stories, review concert  
books and records, research issues,  

Report  

events,  

write your own opinions down on paper  
and tell us what we've missed. We  
would be happy to give you access to  
others in the pages of Common Ground.  
We are looking for variety in styles,  
content, topic and approach. We  
know you have lots to say, so why  
not say it here in CG? Write c/o  
the paper for a style sheet - send  
stamped self-addressed envelope,  
please.

FIRST COMPREHENSIVE CHILD CARE INFOR-  
MATION AND REFERRAL CENTER in Western  
New York will open at the Downtown  
YWCA, 190 Franklin Street in Buffalo  
in July. The Child Care Resource  
and Referral Center is a project of  
the Child Care Coalition of Western  
New York, but will function as a YWCA  
program.  

Three kinds of services will be  
offered: centralized information on  
child care services in Erie County,  
support services and technical  
assistance for parents and providers  
(to improve the quality of care),  
and assistance to employers who are  
seeking child care information on  
behalf of their employees.  

The Child Care Coalition of Western  
New York was founded in 1983 in re-  
sponse to the growing concern about  
good quality child care. Opening  
the Child Care Coalition Resource and  
Referral Center is the first objective  
of the group for 1984-85.  

The program was developed by the  
coalition, a diverse group which  
includes leaders from education,  
social agencies serving children  
and their families, the United Way,  
business, city, county and state  
government, the PTA and industry.  

It is chaired by Dorothy Millard of  
the Day Care Association of Erie  
County.  

These workshops will be offered  
free (or with a small fee for  
supplies) at U.B. for members  
of the University community  
and their families and Emeritus  
Center members. Catalog avail-  
able, but a few workshops of  
interest are: Self Defense  
(Wed. Oct. 23/7:30-9:30) which  
stresses basic self-defense  
techniques; Rape: Prevention  
and Awareness (Wed. Oct. 6/7:30-  
9:30) which is an in-depth  

look at the crime of rape;  
Women: Speaking Publicly (Thurs.  
Oct. 3-24/5:30-6:30) which offers  
background on why women are  
less effective public speakers;  
Breast Self-Examination (Sat.  
Nov. 9/2-4 pm) which instructs  
the "clock method" of self-  
examination and what & how to  
look for in the process. Work-  
shops are held on the Amherst  
Campus. Call 636-2808 if you  
wish to register.
