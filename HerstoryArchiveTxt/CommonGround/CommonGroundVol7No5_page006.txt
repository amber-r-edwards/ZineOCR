Can you imagine risking your life in  
order to avoid hurting someone's  
feelings? As unlikely as it seems,  
people do it all the time. Confronted  
with serious illness or the prospect of  
surgery, many people express concern  
about the treatment recommended by  
their doctor yet worry about offending  
their doctor by seeking a second  
opinion. People sometimes worry that  
doctors will be insulted or refuse to  
take them if they seek a second  
opinion. Fortunately, in most cases  
this is an unnecessary worry. If your  
doctor does object, you should find  
another doctor. A second opinion is  
not an unusual or unreasonable request.  
In fact, it is a necessary step for you  
to take when making an informed  
decision on medical treatment.

There are several ways to go about  
securing a second opinion:

* Your primary doctor can make a  
recommendation. The caution with  
this approach is that you might  
simply be receiving a  
corroboration of the first  
opinion.

* If it is a cancer issue, you can  
call the nearest cancer center.  
In Buffalo, it's Roswell Park  
Memorial Institute 845-4400. You  
can ask for the names of doctors  
specializing in cancer.

* You can call your nearest medical  
school, the State University of  
New York at Buffalo School of  
Medicine.

* You can check the Directory of  
Medical Specialists at the county  
library and call the specialist  
directly.

* You can call the local Medical  
Society in Erie County, the number  
is 852-1810.

* You can call a Physician Referral  
Service. There are several  
operated by local hospitals which  
are listed in the Yellow Pages of  
the phone book.

WELLSPRING:

Once having located a doctor,  
you should ask questions about the  
specialist's credentials:

* Is s/he a specialist in the  
operation (or field)?

* How often does s/he perform this  
particular operation or procedure?  
Is s/he board certified?

* Is s/he on the staff of an  
accredited hospital?

It is important to discuss your  
plans for consultation with your  
doctor. S/he has your original x-rays  
and tests, which the consulting doctor  
will need in her/his deliberation. If  
your doctor is uncooperative, then you  
have other decisions to make about  
continuing your relationship with  
her/him. In the meantime, you should  
be aware that effective January 1,  
1987, New York State Law requires all  
health care practitioners and  
facilities to grant patients access to  
their own medical records. If you are  
having problems gaining access to your  
medical records and need more  
information, write the Access to  
Patient Information Coordinator in the  
New York State Health Department's  
Division of Public Health Protection,  
Empire State Plaza, Corning Tower, Room  
2517, Albany, New York 12237. Or call  
(518) 474-2382. If after receiving a  
second opinion you find that the first  
doctor's recommendations are different  
from the second doctor's, consider  
asking the two doctors to discuss the  
case to see if they can resolve the  
conflict or ask for a third opinion and  
accept the majority decision. Do  
whatever you have to do to assure  
yourself of the best possible medical  
treatment for your individual  
situation. Keep in mind that medicine  
is not an exact science. Often there  
are several valid approaches to  
treatment. Many doctors are highly  
competent and will have your best  
interest in mind. Just don't be  
willing to stake your life on it.

Second-hand smoke is composed of  
smoke exhaled by the smoker, and smoke  
that goes into the air from the burning  
end of the cigarette. Both kinds of  
smoke are dangerous to the non-smoker.  
Because young children spend more time  
with their mothers than anyone else,  
mothers can expose their children to  
high levels of second-hand smoke. “If  
you smoke, it's as if your children are  
smoking, too," Cummings said.

There are 4,000 chemical compounds  
in tobacco smoke; more than 40 have  
been identified as carcinogens (cancer  
causing agents). Some of them include:  
carbon monoxide, formaldehyde, ammonia,  
benzo(a)pyrene, and cadmium.

Citing the 1986 Surgeon General's  
Report, Cummings said, "The hazards to  
children are substantial. Compared to  
children whose parents don't smoke,  
children of smokers have:

* a 20% to 40% greater chance of  
having severe bronchitis or  
pneumonia in the first year of  
life;

* 30% to 80% more respiratory  
symptoms;

* an increased risk of chronic ear  
infections;

* a slower rate of lung  
development."

“In children with asthma, cigarette  
smoke can make the child's lungs work  
harder and can trigger an asthmatic  
attack.

“Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS)  
happens more often to babies whose  
mothers smoke.

“In nursing mothers, the nicotine  
from cigarette smoke is found in breast  
milk," Cummings concluded.

Buffalo's Roswell Park Memorial  
Institute, a division of the New York  
State Health Department and a National  
Cancer Institute-designated  
Comprehensive Cancer Center, is one of  
America's leading cancer research and  
treatment centers.
