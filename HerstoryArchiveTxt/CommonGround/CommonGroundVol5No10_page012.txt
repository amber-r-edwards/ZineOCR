The Buffalo Chapter of Women's Action for Nuclear Disarmament (WAND) sponsored a walk and a rally for peace on Saturday, May 10, the day before Mother's Day. About 60 people, with pledges, marched 15 miles from Amherst to Delaware Park. A rally then concluded their walk. One of the more interesting marchers was WAND member Joanne Curran, who was dressed in a period costume as Julia Ward Howe.

She also read a speech as Howe.

UPDATE.

The week surrounding the issuing of a 

speakers at the rally emphasized all the areas suffering at the hands of the increased military budget. These include education, environment, housing, nutrition, health care, social services, and employment. Joan Bozer, the County Legislator, presented a joint proclamation by the County and the City of Buffalo recognizing May 10 as Mother's Peace Day.

BUFFALO CHILDBIRTH COALITION

by Sharon Green

The Buffalo Childbirth Coalition is an organization supporting options in birth for our community. A diverse group, including parents, childbirth educators, and health care professionals, their philosophy is that birth is a normal, healthy life event.

Their Spring meeting, held on May 14, featured a talk by Dr. John H. Mattox, Chair of the Department of Ob/GYN at Sister's Hospital. He emphasized that recent changes in childbirth practices have come about largely because of voices raised by consumers, rather than physicians. Dr. Mattox, who previously practiced in Washington State and New Mexico, has also been struck by how few midwives there are in a city as large as Buffalo.

Although he supports the work of midwives, he prefers births to occur in a hospital, with an hour after birth discharge for healthy moms and infants. His negativism toward home birth elicited some disagreement from the audience. Finally, he feels very strongly that laboring women need both the emotional and physical support of a coach, who doesn't necessarily have to be her partner/husband.

Also included in the meeting was the regional premiere of the March of Dimes film entitled Journey to Birth. The film emphasizes the dangers of drinking (even moderately), smoking, and taking drugs during pregnancy. It ignored the pressures on women which affect the inability to discontinue such habits. In addition, the only birth depicted in this film was, unfortunately, a Caesarean section. Journey to Birth was redeemed only by its striking in utero photography.

In response, Theresa Epstein, of both Womanfocus and The Buffalo Childbirth Coalition, pointed out stresses, such as sexual harassment, wife abuse, childcare problems, and the “double day” of women who work outside the home, that might result in taking drugs, smoking, or drinking as relaxation or escape. These are social, rather than individual problems; furthermore, our society doesn't encourage us to nurture pregnant women.

The Buffalo Childbirth Coalition will hold a business meeting on June 11 at 7:30 p.m. at 140 Sterling Avenue (see Calendar). For more information, call 883-8497.

However, this film totally ignored the pressures on women which affect the inability to discontinue such habits. According to Epstein, the park permit to WAND, the rally's location behind the Albright Knox Art Gallery proved to be very scenic. However, I had hoped that the media coverage the previous week surrounding this permit controversy might have resulted in a much larger crowd at the rally. In a community the size of Buffalo, it certainly would be nice to see more than 100 or so people at such an important event. Perhaps next Mother's Day?
