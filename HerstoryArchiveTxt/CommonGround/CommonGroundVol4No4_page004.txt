NOW ANNUAL WOMEN HELPING WOMEN AWARDS DINNER  

The NOW Annual Women Helping  
Women Awards Dinner will be held  
December 18, 1985, at the Hyatt  
Regency Hotel at 6:30 P.M.  

Three women who have made major  
contributions to women in a variety  
of interesting ways will be honored.  

Peggy Chinn has been a revolutionary  
force in the world of nursing  
(which is still a 96% female dominated  
field). She has written many  
important books on nursing theory  
and has incorporated feminist theory  
in her approach. She is a founder  
of Cassandra, and has started a pub-  
lishing business called Margaret  
Daughters. She is also a very active  
member of the Emma and "Common  
Ground” collectives.  

Constance Eve is a pioneer in the  
field of helping incarcerated women.  
She is the leader of a group known  
as Women for Human Rights and Dignity  
who make Christmas gifts available to  
women in prison to give to their  
children, thus helping to keep the  
family bond strong. Under Constance's  
leadership Women for Human Rights and  
Dignity have renovated a home in  
Buffalo to be used as an alternative  
to prison for women who qualify. The  
women live in the home and receive  
counseling and career training. They  
also are able to keep in close contact  
with their families because they are  
closer to home and have time in their  
schedules to be devoted to the family  
unit. This alternative to incarcer-  
ation helps a group of women (potential  
prisoners) not being serviced by any  
other women's volunteer group in Erie  
County and is unique.  

Jo Osborne is the Public Relations  
Director of Planned Parenthood of Erie  
County. She has been an active force  
in the Women's Health field for many  
years. She has been instrumental in  
keeping Planned Parenthood visible  
and available to help women receive  
health care related to family plan-  
ning. Jo is an active lobbyist for  

family planning programs and has  
been a part of the backbone of the  
Pro-Choice Communications Network.  

Planned Parenthood of Buffalo and  
Erie County will be the group awarded  
this year by NOW for their tireless  
efforts on behalf of women's health  
care and reproductive freedom in this  
day of right wing politics. Planned  
Parenthood is to be commended for  
opening a new contraceptive clinic in  
the face of much adversity this year.  
Kristina Young, the Director of Plan-  
ned Parenthood will be accepting the  
award.  

Buffalo and Erie County NOW have  
the highest regard for these people  
and organizations and are proud to  
give them the Annual Women Helping  
Women Award.  

If you would like to attend the  
Awards Dinner, please call the NOW  
phone, 674-1544, and leave a message.  
Tickets are $20.00 and include a  
free wine and beer bar before dinner.  
A vegetarian meal is available.  

A poll taken by the Institute of  
Professional Businesswomen shows the  
American women in business feel that  
they suffer from family and job-  
related stress and lack of management  
guidance. The study says 82% of the  
women polled suffer from stress related  
to worry about children and answering  
to more than one boss. In the health-  
related portion of the survey, 58%  
said they do not eat three meals a day,  
and 45% said they were more than ten  
pounds overweight.  

The intentions of this law to  
prevent pregnancy are honorable,  
but results if prevention fails  
could be disastrous. How much  
control can parents exert over  
their children's sex lives and  
should they be held responsible  
for their children's sins?  

Both pro-life and pro-choice  
people fear that the law will  
cause both sets of parents to  
bring pressure on the pregnant  
girl to have an abortion.  

The AFL-CIO has 35 members on  
its labor federation executive  
council and is dominated by  
middle-aged white males. It has  
only 2 women on the council. At  
last week's convention Linda  
Puchala, president of the 23,000-  

member Association of Flight  
Attendants, was passed over to  
fill one of four openings on the  
council. Though Ms. Puchala,  
age 36, represents the segment  
of labor, service jobs, that now  
has 75% of the nation's jobs, she  
was told, "Your union is a  
young union and you are a young  
person" by council members.  

10% of the workers in the  
service sector of the U.S.  
economy is unionized and  
Ms. Puchala fears by the year  
2000, if the trend continues,  
we're only going to represent  
10% of the American workforce.  
She joked and gently chided  
the board for not nominating  
her and many female delegates  
expressed anger during inter-  
views at her failure to obtain  
the opening.  

There is a possibility that  
California by the turn of the  
century will have a majority  
of Asian and Hispanic popula-  
tion. It is projected that non-  
Hispanic whites will only account  
for 38.4% of the population by  
the year 2030. According to the  
study, "Population Change and  
California's Future," published  
by the Washington-based Popula-  
tion Reference Bureau, Asian's  
growth is projected for 15.6%  
by 2030 and Hispanics to 38.1%.  

It suggests a meeting of  
representatives from all groups  
to decide "What kinds of a  
California do we want in the  
21st century?" Philip Martin,  
an economist at the University  
of California - Davis and Leon  
F. Bouvier, a demographer with  
the population bureau, the  
authors of the report, suggest  

the changes should be prepared for,  
especially in the educational  
system, labor force, political  
system and culture.  

The White House Chief of Staff  
Donald Regan outraged feminists  
by stating that most women wouldn't  
understand the issues at stake at  
the U.S.-Soviet Summit meeting in  
Geneva. He said Nancy Reagan's  
and Raisa Gorbachev's activities  
would be more appealing to them.  

He said, "They're not going to  
understand (missile) throw-weights  
or what is happening in Afghanistan  
or what is happening in human rights.  
Some women will, but most women -  
believe me, your readers for the  

most part if you took a poll - would  
rather read the human-interest stuff  
of what happened."  

Trene Natividad, chairwoman of  
the National Women's Political  
Caucus replied, "It's hard not to  
laugh. All the gender gap polls  
in '84 showed that peace was the  
No. 1 women's issue. We're the ones  
bearing the sons who would go to war."  

U.S. Roman Catholic Bishops have  
released a statement expanding their  
“pro-life” stance to cover not only  
the abortion issue, but capital  
punishment, nuclear war, social  
welfare spending and immigration  
policy - offending some church con-  
servatives who fear the dilution of  
the "pro-life" stand on abortion.  

“Basic human rights are violated in  
many ways," the statement said, "by  
abortion and euthanasia, by injustice  
and the denial of equality to individ-  
uals or various groups of persons, by  
some forms of human experimentation,  
by neglect of the underprivileged and  
disadvantaged who deserve society's  
concern and support."

30th-More than 100 members of New  
York women's groups seize a five-  
story, city-owned building, planning

women and children, a lesbian center,  
a drug treatment center, and a  
feminist school, 1970.  

Marlin Schneider, a Wisconsin  
state legislator, is responsible for  
the grandparent liability law which  
is part of a larger bill on teen-age  
pregnancy signed by the Wisconsin  
legislature. Schneider was on a  
study committee working on legisla-  
tion dealing with teen-age pregnancy  
when "it occurred to me that we can  
impact on boys by making their  
parents financially responsible for  
their child's offspring." Schneider's  
feeling is that parents are held  
responsible if their son breaks a  
neighbor's window, but not if he  
impregnates the neighbor's daughter.  

In Wisconsin, this is no longer  
true. The state has made the parents  
of underage children financially  
responsible for the offspring of  
those children. The girl's and the  
boy's parents are now equally respon-  
sible until their child reaches  
18 years of age.  

The Canadian government is consider-  
ing adding housewives to the national  
retirement pension plan. The report  
that describes including homemakers  
proposes that the government subsidize  
pension contributions for housewives  
in lower-middle income brackets.  

Amendments to the pension plan  
require approval of two-thirds of  
the provinces as well as the federal  
parliaments and two-thirds of the  
country's population.  

Local Congressman Jack Kemp intro-  
duced legislation to cut off federal  
money to family planning clinics that  
provide referrals or information about  
abortion, which was discarded in the  
House Appropriations Committee.  

In reply, Ms. Kristina Young,  
Executive Director of Planned Parent-  
hood of Buffalo and Erie County, said,  
"In their fanatical zeal to prevent  
abortion, Mr. Kemp and his far-right  
followers will have succeeded in  
exacerbating the tragic outcomes of  
unwanted pregnancy and unwanted birth.  
The result of the new legislation is  
that the abortion rate will rise in  
this community." She called the Kemp  
amendment the "most direct and debili-  
tating attack” on family planning and  
its history.  

Nancy Castro, President of Buffalo  
NOW, challenged Mr. Kemp to support  
his women constituents who are subjected  
to “vile and violent harassment"  
when they attempt to enter local  
women's clinics.  

A 2-1/2 year program in which two  
Baltimore high-school-aged teens were  
offered birth control advice and free  
contraceptives reduced the pregnancy  
rates among students there.  

The program, conducted by Johns  
Hopkins University, showed that the  
median age of the start of sexual  
activity increased and the pregnancy  
rate among these girls decreased.  

Researcher Jane Hardy said the  
counseling caused some girls to  
refrain from sexual activity, and  
the data was significant because it  
refutes the claims of those who  
believe that the provision of contra-  
ceptives causes kids to become  
promiscuous.
