Review by E. R. Mann

In Keeper of Accounts, Irena  
Klepfisz has offered to the reader  
a clean, bright slice of her life;  
indeed her soul,—between the cov-  
ers of this collection of poetry.  
Her work is sharp. It is keen-  
edged, and while sometimes painful,  

never dramatic for mere effect. She  
writes with heart-(and gut-) felt  
honesty and great skill.

Her work is multidimensional, and  

like a prism, offers new insights and  

interpretations with each fresh look.

While her work and life are deeply  

connected, and her poetry is extreme-  

ly personal, it is very accessible be-  

cause of its style and clarity.  
Keeper of Accounts is divided into  

four parts: From the Monkey House  

and Other Cages; Different Enclosures;  

Urban Flowers; and Inhospitable Soil.

She explores, from the inside, the ex-  

perience of alienation, of migration  

from one place to another, and of im-  

mersion from one dimension to another.  
Klepfisz, Polish-born Jew who  

immigrated to America, examines what  

it’s like to be uprooted, torn away,  

and have no power over your own des-  

tiny, except to adapt or die. The  

adaptation changes you profoundly.  

You can wither away and die, or die  

fighting, but die you do; there are no  

other choices. This is a theme often  

repeated, and clearly expressed in  

Bashert, a poem dedicated to those who  

died and those who survived, and the  

moments of fate that decided it so.

She wonders about "fate", and whether  

anyone can escape. One poem asks:  

"Does it not matter what we do and  

where we live? Are there moments in  

history which cannot be escaped or  

transcended, but which act like time  

warps permanently trapping all those  

who are touched by them?"

Moses explores what happens  

when you must compete with your own  
kind, and the things that separate  
people from each other: distortion  

of self, assumptions about other peo-  
ple, fear, and survival skills so  
finely honed they prohibit connections  
between people, even connections be-  
tween the self and the soul.

But Klepfisz' work is not of despair;  
it is of survival. In the heart of many  
of her poems is the ability to keep the  
spark of self or resistance alive, like  
a deeply buried and safely banked fire.

It is also about the slow patient,  
determined and focused continuing of  
life, oblivious to whether or not con-  
ditions are correct or the time is  
right, but following an inner sense of  
what to do. She captures that instant  
of poised, breathless moment in time,  
awaiting the next moment that spills  
into change.

“who we are’’

—Evelyn Torton Beck

Klepfisz also writes of being different.  

Forsaking convention, taking a risk,  

she refuses to hide. It includes  
being different even among a collection  
of anomalies:

"There are some who dream of  

a splitting of an inner will  
a wrenching from the designated  
path.  

who dream a purple flower  
Standing solitary in a  
yellow field"  
- from Royal Pearl.

The greatest insight to her work  
comes from the author's acknowledge-  
ment of her roots, and her refusal to  
split herself into separate selves—  
she is attempting to be all of her  
selves at once and to resolve the con-  
flicts this naturally brings out.

Irena Klepfisz was born in Warsaw,  
Poland in 1941. She is a Jew who sur-  
vived by "passing" as a blonde-haired,  
blue-eyed Christian child—speaking  
Polish, reciting catechism, living a  
lie to survive. The Holocaust she  
survived is not the generalized “mass"  
murders of Jews, but the individual  

experience which she still daily sur-  
vives. She writes of family and spirits.

She compares the experience she had  
"passing" as a Christian child in War-  
saw: adapting, assimilating and  
afraid, to her experience in "safe"  
America where she also learned to take  
comfort in not "looking Jewish". She  
is keenly aware of how the American  
melting pot works, which is fit in or  
die, not the picturesque "blending" of  
our cultural myth. Some can fit in and  
lose nothing of their vigorous nature,  
some fit in by cutting away parts of  
themselves, and some never make it.  
Kind, accommodating America, currently  
undergoing a Christian revival, can  
turn on Jews as quickly here as in  
Germany in the 1940's.

Klepfisz is searching for the free-  
dom to be all of who she is. She hopes  
for the time, space and environment  
which allows her to be a daughter, a  
woman, a poet, a worker, a survivor, a  
Jew and a lesbian, without sacrificing  
one aspect to another.

This collection of poetry expresses  
a continued hope for the future, and  
belongs on the bookshelves of those  
who also hope.

Review: Tatterhood  
and Other Tales

Tatterhood and Other Tales, Edited by  
Ethel Johnston Phelps, Illustrated by  
Pamela Baldwin Ford, The Feminist Press,  
1978,

REVIEW BY THE EMMA COLLECTIVE

Tatterhood and Other Tales is a  
collection of folk tales from all over  
the world. They are tales of tradition,  
magic and adventure. In all there are  
25 stories, 18 retold by the editor,  
Ethel Johnston Phelps.

The folk tales in this collection  
are very entertaining. The worlds of  
kings and queens and trolls are some-  
times a part of these traditional  
stories... Children of all ages seem  
to enjoy an escape into this fantasy  

and cultures of Celtic, Norse, Latin,  
Egyptian, African, South American and  
Chinese people.

The stories are about adventurous  
women—young and old—and are ro-  
mantic, humorous, about relationships,  
or their families. They were selected  
because of their positive themes,  

their representations of other cultures  
and the importance the influence  
strong, active female characters can  
have on young women and girls.

Folk tales have been passed down  
from generation to generation. They  
preserve the lives, the aspirations,  
the values and heritage of a people.  
Sometimes they explain the unknown  
of the physical world, or are a  
conglomeration of folk wisdom and  
values, and offer a way to teach these  
values to the young.

Tatterhood is a good book for  
children to explore the differences  
in cultures and peoples. It is  
available at EMMA the Buffalo Women's  
Bookstore,
