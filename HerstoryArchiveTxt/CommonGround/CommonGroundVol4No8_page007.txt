GRAVESIDE

I go to your grave

the car makes

the hillside curve

at Pisgah View

stops at the Magnolia tree

I am alone

your bones nudge

the scab of my hidden tears  
I weep within the rain

I walk up to the place

sideways

as I once approached the Pacific Ocean  
at Cape Disappointment, Oregon

I am your daughter

on the way to the store  
to buy cornmeal

to fry okra

from Robena's garden

I have much to say to you, Mother  
but now there is only time

to arrange the silk flowers

limp in the rain

I entwine two of them

one red, one pale purple

I do not tell you Daddy has  
moved down the lilacs, the rosebud

Your death still takes my legs  
away, Mother

But I walk on the air/my will  
away from the mirror you  
hold for me deep in the  
earth

I am your poet, Mother  
though my words do not grace  
your ears

I am bone of your bone  
you stand in my frame

Bone catches in the throat  
of this grief

“Oh, Rose,

Rosie

of my dreams

my sighs

where are

the baby's

white hands

that used to

hold mine so knowingly?  
In my grandfather's  
eyes

as he sits in

the deep blue velvet  
chair

warm lap,

empty arms--

Oh Rose,

Rosie

now an old

woman,

loose nightgown  
ocean-dancer--

Are you still

and sleepless

in the cold

white

hospital bed?

Where are you now,  
my Rose,

my love?

Only yet--

a quickening moment,

splinter of light,

soft shadow.

A FLASH OF BLUE

Going through the house, my mother's,  
Now mine, with all her things

In subtle patterns on display,

I walk cautiously.

Her painter's eye still makes the rule;  
Skews a pot of peonies,  
Japanned to catch the light

Places a mirror so, its bleared reflection  
Sees the garden rockery

Now lost in weeds beyond the window  
Cleaned by me.

The cherry table, patina buffed by me,  
The corner cupboard glimmering.  
Its mirrored shelves hold

Mother's Canton, old Imari, fans,  
A four inch ivory courtesan  
With ancient almond squint,  
Who lays her train just so.

I've almost reached the furthest door  
When the blue, that flash,  
Holds me in mid-stride.

It's deep, and bold as a peacock's eye,  
As water, sky reflecting, in our pond,  
As blue as sunlit sea, which Mother,  
Painting on the latticed porch,

Made more real than the salt-thick  
Sea itself.  
Her own blue, I think,

In the silken lining of her cuff,  
The hem of obi-ed kimono.

She wore it here,

Idling at table with her friends.

She seems to sit there still, and calls,  
Her little voice imperative,  
From a shadowed hiding place.

I stare beyond, the mist palpates,  
Water mirrors shift and blur,  
Confound my dazzled gaze.

I raise my hand, saluting where was,

Painting Mother into memory  
Without her special gift, and go,  
Self-released into life once more.

southern love (for Robert's Momma)

yeah! waitin for  
momma's biscuits  
warm everywhere

here time becomes an old photograph  
bronzed  
just waitin for

when she wiggles  
her old bell her way  
for callin us boys

all eight of us waitin

in the next room playin

tic tac toes tryin

to play like we was enjoyin

it instead of enjoyin

the sweet smell of honey and butter

cornbread huggin those hot eggs and momma's secret

eggs and momma she goes at those eggs

she makes music in that kitchen

where she's a hummin and smilin all the while  
hummin and a fixin and a fussin

and singin to Jesus

We are mesmerized

we pretend tic tac toe  
but we love the music momma makes

next room she's a singin and a hummin

a girl in her own land

talkin to her own momma and poppa (long gone)  
like they was right there with her

waitin for that old bell to sing

whippin up her secrets makin cornbread  
for her boys

her boys waitin  
playin tic tac toe  
listenin

to momma

makin music

with her mouth  
with her hands  
with her sweat

TO MY GRANDMOTHER

In this room  
signs I don’t want to read:  
shades drawn on the craggy autumn day  
white-uniformed stillness  
a circle of visitors  
awollen with what cannot be said  
hollow-eyed and distant  
a sweet dry smell  
your mouth sagging at the corners  
your mouth too weak to reach for air  
no sign of your body beneath the covers  
I search for your hand  
only to find a trembling  
I do not recognize  
straying in and out of your wrist  
now I know nothing can be denied  
so I want to scream your name  
"Rose Arcaro"  
introduce you for the last time  
to the day you pinned an orchid  
on my friend's dress  
to the day I didn't learn how  
because I wanted you to do it always  
but I will let you now, teach  
me how to replace the comb  
falling from your hair  
a three-step arc of simplicity  
and I would dance for you  
if I did not think your aging into earth  
were natural  
and I would wish  
for you to translate the essence  
of your blue eyes and black hair  
at eighty-one  
into my hands when you can no longer speak  
if I did not know that in some shady corner  
in the garden of my eyes  
we already speak the same language  
we write a god-less book of survival  
in spite of generations of shrines.
