cuses on human rights, especially
in South Africa.

1984 - Upcoming event: The YWCA of
Buffalo and Erie County holds its
"Racism in America Conference."

The YWCA's Imperative is to elim-
inate racism wherever it exists. That
the elimination of racism is the most
compelling and urgent job facing our
country today is the firm conviction
of the Young Women's Christian Asso-
ciation of the USA. It has stated
this in its National Convention and
is backing it up with a concentrated
effort in all of its programs for its
more than two and one half million
member-participants.

Racism hurts everyone. Both the
giver and receiver of iniquity, in-
justice and the denial of human rights.
Racism diminishes the human spirit
because it diminishes self-respect
and stature.

For these reasons, the YWCA is using
its collective power to act now for
what is not only right--but necessary,
if our world in our time is to be
freed from bondage to our own past.

The conference on Racism in Amer-
ica Today will be held in May. Check
with the YWCA for more information.
Call 852-6120. Ask for the Women's
Program Director.

Our hope is that the May confer-
ence will benefit laypersons, pro-
fessionals and businesses who are
in the people business.

Dear Common Ground and Community:

It is with great pride--and a
touch of awe--that we proudly an-
nounce the Gay and Lesbian Community
of Buffalo and its friends have
raised $12,000 towards purchasing the
Gay and Lesbian Community Center at
647 West Delevan Avenue. It is a

living monument to our ability to
reach out to one another and join
together in a venture larger than
any one of us alone.

The dream of the Founders Fund
Committee was shared by hundreds of
other individuals. Over one hundred
Founders will be acknowledged on a
permanent plaque in the Center's
front room. There were a few gen-
erous donations exceeding $100, but
equally important were the numerous
smaller donations that added up to

a major commitment. Bar Night alone
brought in $1,000 in one and two
dollar contributions, and "The First
Gay Telethon Phone Bank" helped
push us over the top.

Most of the Gay organizations
based in the city became Founders,
many gay-owned, and gay-supported
businesses responded to the call
with an open checkbook. In addition,
sympathetic non-gay groups and in-
dividuals shared the dream and joined
the growing list of supporters.

This dream that brought us together
was the belief that the Gay and Les-
bian community needed a permanent
home, a heart and center for its
activities. Today, 647 West Delevan
is the hub of social and business
meeting activities, health-related
services and religious gatherings.
The AIDS Task Force, Gay Youth Group,
Gay Fathers, all call us home. Also
the Metropolitan Community Church
has some meetings at our center.

The GLCC Newsletter is created
monthly on the premises; every Friday
night a coffee house offers us the
opportunity to relax with one
another, and the hotline is open
daily. A library committee is already
at work and a calendar of special
events is in full swing every month.

We--working together--successfully
raised the down payment, one year's
insurance costs, closing costs and the
seed money for a renovation fund.
The actual closing date was January
17th. It is very feasible that the
GLCC will belong to the community
free and clear within 5 years. We
accomplished our goals!

But what of the future? The
Founders' Fund was in reality only
the beginning of a great venture.

We have proven to ourselves that we
are a community of vision, capable
of forming a united front when re-
quired and working with sympathetic
friends beyond our own circle. We
have created a permanent place where
every gay and lesbian group can
meet, a facility that can give birth
to new groups as needed, a center that
nurtures us as we help it grow. We
as a community have given the lie
to the theory that says we are
fragmented and uncertain in our goals.
Our greater strength has always been
in ourselves and we have finally
proven to ourselves that we are
capable of obtaining a shared and
significant future. Let us con-
tinue together!

Sincerely,

GLCC Founders' Fund Committee
