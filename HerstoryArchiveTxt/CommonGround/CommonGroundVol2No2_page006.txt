CAMP

be spared the experience of war  
that her husband had lived through.  
She took shears from her bag, and  
cut the jacket into shreds as we  
sang the refrain:  

Child, child, child, child,  

Will I ever see you grow?  

I will fight for your future  

I love you so.  
Gradually the word "soldier" was  

substituted for the word "child".  
Women who were detained after  

crossing the "yellow line" at the  
gates or climbing the fence were  
handcuffed and taken to a detention  
center on Depot grounds where most  
of them decided to non-cooperate.  
Over 500 “Jane Does" were finger-  
printed, photographed and issued  
"ban and bar" warning letters, and  
those who were recognized as repeat  
offenders were issued summonses to  
appear in Federal Court in Roch-  
ester. Over 250 women were detained  
following the largest civil dis-  
obedience action of the summer on  
August 1. Reports of conversations  
with some of the M.P.'s that de-  
tained and processed the women re-  
vealed that many of them share con-  
cern for the arms build-up and were  
willing to discuss the issue in  
private conversations. Regular  
contact with the Camp was initiated  
by the Depot as low flying heli-  
copters patrolled the border at all  
hours of the night and day, gener-  
ating the fearful and oppressive  
noise that raises thoughts of Viet-  
nam and more recently, Central  
America.  

Obviously all of this didn't hap-  
pen in a vacuum. It happened in  
Seneca County, a rural setting of  
quiet beauty that belies the earth-  
destroying hardware that shares the  
land with the farms and parks between  
Lakes Cayuga and Seneca. Despite  
the constant outreach work carried  
on continually with townspeople,  
police and Depot authorities, cam-  
pers were subjected to verbal har-  
assment of varying intensity  
throughout the summer. Conflicts  
over particular issues were well-  
covered by national media, while  
little attention was given to the  

continual dialog that took place  
with area residents and businesses  
in informal gatherings at the camp  
or in town. (More balanced accounts  
could be found in the print media of  
nearby cities, e.g. Buffalo, Roch-  
ester, when their own reporters  
covered the story.) Campers ac-  
cepted invitations by community  

and church groups to discuss the  
purpose of the camp and the dis-  
armament issue, and many attended  
area events in order to talk with  
the citizens. We soon learned that  
the counter-demonstrators and others  
who regularly harassed campers  

were hardly typical of area resi-  
dents, many of whom expressed their  

concern in a spirit of honest dialog.  

Along with so many of the 6000  
women who participated in the Camp,  
I came away strengthened and em-  
powered to continue working "for a  
Future of Peace and Justice", and  
as a woman, I take pride in the  
dedication, talent and skills that  
were integral to the success of the  
summer: the labor of women who  
built the pavilion, renovated the  
barn and house, laid water lines and  
built access ramps for the dif-  
ferently abled; the organizers,  
program directors, facilitators,  
legal support and outreach staff,  
doing stressful work with care so  
much of the time; the enthusiasm of  
the campers as they moved in and out  
with new and fresh ideas and plans;  
the beauty of the music and art  
work and all the creative ex-  
pression of hope and dedication to  
the future.  

Yes, it was a success, for it  

provided an environment from which  
so many women could express their  
outrage, anger and concern through  
nonviolent actions and words. A  
young soldier from the Depot who  
stopped by one afternoon told me  
of his fear that the Army was af-  
fecting his way of thinking and  
his behavior, and so had initiated  
steps toward an honorable dis-  
charge. Ironically, the formal  
grounds for his leaving the Seneca  
Army Depot - “Inability to Adapt" -  
is the same reason hundreds of wo-  
men traveled so far to enter it.
