Dear Common Ground:

My block has a prostitution
problem. Call it an issue, call
it an industry, there are hookers
on our street.

Now, you're from Tau Ceti [a
fictional outer space place] and
you don't know anything about gentri-
fication, or women's liberation, or
a money economy, or racism. You
are politically naive. You are
blind justice.

Blind justice says: a group of
residents, each unit of which is
supplied with at least one of the
flat-chested type, complains about
the business activities of a group
of the round-chested type:

The observer from Tau Ceti says:*
What is wrong with the business
activities of the round-chested
ones? Did they fail to get a li-
cense? Are their working condi-
tions unhealthy?*

Their working conditions are
unregulated, and they are unable to
get licenses because their job does
not legally exist. *Is it a new
job classification?* The oldest.
*Are they a menace to public health
and safety?* Compared to what? In
America, where this story takes
place, tens of thousands of people
died last year as a result of
smoking, alcohol-related auto acci-
dents and other lifestyle diseases
such as diabetes, colon cancer, and
heart disease. Of the number that
died in prostitution-related acci-
dents, most were industrial workers
who suffered from inadequate health-
care and sweatshop working condi-
tions, and most of the remainder
were people hired to stop the trade.

The observer from Tau Ceti says:*
This blind justice thing is too
difficult. I don't understand what
is going on and I want you to ex-
plain.*

Well, as long as you're . :
ted in reality, I'll tell you that
the flat-chested ones, called men,
are traditionally, that is, by
law and culture, considered superior
to the others, called women.

This superiority entitles them to
decide where a woman may live (not
on our block), what she can do for
a living (work for them), and what
she will earn (not much). In addi-
tion, the first group is composed
of a group known as White and the
second is primarily of the group
known as Black. These two groups
have the same power relationship.
Got it? The hookers have oppression
coming and going.

*Is there any reason, other than
centuries of the habit of privilege
that these White men and nuclear
families are hassling the prosti-
tutes?* Yes, and the name of the
game is property values. Simply
put, no one wants to live down
the street from hookers, so it's
harder to make a profit on the
houses we bought in the neighbor-
hood.

All neighborhoods have problems,
and everyone has the right to de-
cide, within the limits of law and
courtesy, with whom they wish to
live. Nobody wanted to live down
the street from a gay couple, so
they moved here; nobody wanted to
rent to a family with children, so
they did too. Now these people
buy a block and declare it off
limits to their own definition of
undesirables. That's the American
way.

We had a block meeting. An
executive of the Vice Squad said
that the police have done what they
could. "These girls are in and out,"
he said. "One girl was arrested 19
times and each time showed up back
on the street. But the tough laws
for "Johns", which makes them liable
for the same punishment as the
hookers, cut down on their business."
What was the average length of a
sentence for the "Johns"? I asked.
“None have ever come to trial," he
answered, “we let them plead down."
The government guarantees you equal
protection under the law, but not
if you are a woman.

Dear Common Ground:

We as handicapped adults would
like to respond to the special
protection needs of people in
wheelchairs (see June 1983 CG,
Self-Protection issue).

Upon discussion of these needs
in our women's group, we came up
with some informal recommendations
that you may find helpful.

1) Place your keys between each
finger, like a brass knuckle effect.

2) Poke with the built-up part of
your key (some people have a built
up piece to better enable them to
hold onto their keys).

3) Use your chair to back up or
forward, running over toes, espe-
cially if it’s electric.

4) Pull parts of wheelchair off
to use to strike out with: arm rest,
foot pedals and seat belt.

5) Use your leg and arm power--
kick, flail arms.

6) Use the outside of your purse
to stick hat pins, so when you
need them they can be found easily.

7) When in your home or apartment,
turn lights on in front window,
rather than against a wall, because
if you are in front of a light you
cast a shadow. Whereas if you are
behind the light, the light will
block the view into the room.

8) Invest in sheers for your window.

Sincerely,

Michelle Hydock and the
Adult Center Women's
Group, Rms. 103 & 107

Association

A councilman said, "It's not the
police's fault, the Supreme Court
recently made the laws weaker." The
loitering for sodomy law, we said,
is not really an issue with female
prostitutes. The laws protect us
all but not if you're a woman.

*Why don't they go into a differ-
ent line of work?* According to
the Fact Sheet on Institutional
Racism, October 1978, about 15% of
the U.S. population is Black, but
more than 48% of women in prison
are. Between 1975 & 1977 the gap
between the incomes of White and
Black families widened in both
absolute (buying power) and relative
terms from $5489 to $7177. They are
between the hammer of sexism and the
anvil of racism. Black women are 18
times more likely to be victims of
rape than White women.

The people on my street aren't
worried about ending prostitution.
They just want the “colored girls",
as one put it, to "move along".

But, as women, as feminists,
whatever our color, we must put an
end to the sexist mentality that
supports prostitution and porno-
graphy, the racism that perpetuates
the abuse of our sisters and the
narrowness that enables us to forget
it when it isn’t "our” problem.

Pastor Martin Niemoller said:
In Germany they first came for the
Communists and I didn't speak up
because I wasn't a Communist. Then
they came for the Jews, and I didn't
speak up because I wasn't a Jew.
Then they came for the trade union-
ists, and I didn't speak up because
I wasn't a trade unionist. Then
they came for the Catholics, and I
didn't speak up because I was a
Protestant. Then they came for me,
and by that time there was no one
left to speak up.

Come down off Tau Ceti and
speak up.

HAVEN HOUSE SHELTER
FOR WOMEN

by Cherin Silverstein

"Women who are battered by men are
quite often women who were sexually
abused by their fathers when they were
children.” This was the statement that
opened an interview I recently did with
Dorothy Hobbs, a former resident and
volunteer at Haven House, a home for
battered women which opened in Buffalo
in 1979.

On May 14, Haven House celebrated
its 4th birthday. In the four years
it has been open, 982 women and 1392
children have passed through its doors.
In the past year, Haven House helped
277 women and 337 children from bat-
tered homes. They happily report that
the majority of their women, 70 to 75%,
leave the battered situation perma-
nently.

The fact that Haven House sometimes
has a waiting list for its facilities
should not be a deterrent to women
seeking refuge behind its doors.

"There is always someplace for the wo-
man to go. Immediate shelter can al-
ways be referred elsewhere when nec-
essary. Women always have the choice
of referral or being placed on our
waiting list," said Dorothy Brown,
Director of Haven House.

Dear CG:

On the inspiration of the women's
peace camp at Greenham Common, England,
and those protesting for peace across
Europe, women throughout the United
States will be gathering this summer
at the Seneca Army Depot.

The Seneca Army Depot is the storage
site for the Pershing II missile, the
neutron bomb and other weapons of war.
Beginning in the fall of 1983, NATO
first-strike weapons, the Pershing II
and the Cruise, are scheduled for ship-
ment to Europe. The Seneca Army Depot
is the main point of departure on the
east coast from which nuclear weapons
are transported to Europe.

The women's peace camp is organized
in social services to fund the
increasing military budget, the feminization
of poverty, the toxic wastes and
leaking radiation into the environment
and the increasing violence in our
society, particularly against women,
and the growing danger to people all
over the world and to the earth itself
shows our necessity as women to organ-
ize together and protest this insanity.

As well as being the sister camp to
Greenham Common, we are part of a long
tradition of women's resistance in
Upstate New York. In 1590, the women
of the Iroquois confederacy gathered
at Seneca Falls to call for the end of
wars among the tribes. In 1848, women
went to Seneca Falls for the first Wo-
men's Rights Convention and the launch-
ing of the Suffragist Movement. And,
throughout the mid-1800s, Harriet
Tubman led her people from slavery
along the Underground Railroad through
central New York.

Women will again gather for peace
and justice. The encampment will be-
gin July 4 and will run through Labor
Day, and will involve women from all
parts of the United States and from
a variety of backgrounds. There
will be workshops on many issues among
which are racism, sexism, homophobia,
feminism, nonviolence, women's history
(herstory), social and economic justice,
military conversion and more. We will
explore our commonalities and our dif-
ferences as women of color and white
women, old women and young women,
lesbians and straight women, and dif-
ferently abled women.

The campgrounds will be located in
Romulus, New York, nearby to the Sen-
eca Army Depot. We are currently in
the process of purchasing 53 acres of
land for the event. Donations of mon-
ey, time, camping supplies and trans-
portation are very much needed.

Although the encampment is legal,
there will be protests and civil dis-
obedience at the depot throughout the
summer. There is a large nonviolent
civil disobedience action planned for
August 1.

Women are encouraged to come for a
day, a weekend, the whole summer.
Child care is available on the land.
If you are interested and would like
more information, please call me,
Donna Gans, at 833-6803, in the morn-
ing before 11 and evenings after 6.

COMMON GROUND

The 36-bed facility, which doesn't
list its address but does have a 24-
hour Hotline (884-6000), can find
shelter for as many as 36 women and
children at one time. According to
Ms. Brown, no distinction is made be-
tween mental and physical abuse. The
only restriction is that the batterer
must be a member of the household.
This is a federal as well as state re-
striction necessary for Haven House
funding.

The Advisory Board is composed of
representatives of 21 agencies and
organizations which comprise the Coal-
ition for Victims of Domestic Violence.
The Coalition is the parent body of
Haven House. The Salvation Army,
Child & Family Services, YWCA, Catho-
lic Charities, and Pat Courtney, a Medaille
College student, were the major con-
cerned parties at the inception of Ha-
ven House.

Dorothy Hobbs, a positive-thinking
woman, was one of their first six
women. She helped to find, clean and
paint the original building as well as
gather furniture and decorate the
building. According to Dorothy, “We
tried to make it as pretty and homey
as possible. We all worked very hard.
My children helped to gather furniture
from all over Western New York.”

Dorothy was a battered wife who
planned the escape of herself and her
children from Maryland to her sister's
house in Clarence, N.Y., after her
cast for 18 months and the doctors
didn't give her much hope of ever
walking again.

"No one has the right to batter an-
other person,” said Dorothy, who can
walk today. “Emotionally battered wo-
men, I feel, are worse off than physi-
cally abused women. Physical hurts
heal.”

Asked if there was a family pattern
to battering, Dorothy responded, "Quite
a few of the women were raped by their
fathers. Sometimes whole families were
raped. One girl I worked with was
first raped when she was five years old
by her father. This continued all her
life. She left home and married and
was battered by her husband for many
years. She ended up okay, though, she
went back to school and she and her
children are all doing fine.”

"Many of the women who have had that
experience keep it quiet until they
reach Haven House,” said the Director,
Dorothy Brown, "When they get here,
they realize that it has happened to
others.”

There are male volunteers at Haven
House who work primarily with the
children. "We feel it is important
for the children to have a role model
and male contact so that they don't
think that all men are bad," say
both Dorothys.

Women are assisted in seeking
counsel from doctors and lawyers
while they are at Haven House. There
are also many follow-up programs for
the women and children.

The story of Dorothy Hobbs is a
familiar story of battered women.
What makes Dorothy different is that
she is a "winner". She took a nega-
tive, hurtful aspect of her life and
turned it into something positive and
constructive. She helps other women.
Dorothy no longer volunteers her time
at Haven House but I am sure you can
find her, as did I, making sure that
everyone else knows about the exist-
ence of it.

Cherin Silverstein, mother of 2 children
is currently majoring in Humanities/
Writing at Medaille College in Buffalo.
She writes articles relating to women
for Common Ground, including the monthly
"Her-Stories", Women in History feature.
She was formerly a writer for Burge
Publishing where she compiled historical
research. Her poetry has appeared in
the Prelude and the American Anthology
of Poetry.
