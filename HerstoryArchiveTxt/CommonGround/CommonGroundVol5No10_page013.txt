In the spring of 1980, after  
several unsuccessful attempts to  
have the situation remedied—that  
of being sexually harassed by three  
male co-workers—Dale Taylor left  
her job as a cook in a college  
dormitory at one of the upstate  
campuses of the State University  
of New York. This was after regis-  
tering complaints through the  
proper channels to her union stew-  
ard, supposedly the required first  
step, and then to higher level  
supervisors when the steward re-  
fused to act.

Taylor had, at that time, been  
employed by the college's food  
services operations run by the  
contractee, the Faculty Student  
Association, for five years (three  
of them full-time). At the age  
of 40+ and single, she was her own  
support. By leaving her job, she  
was giving up not only a steady  
salary with excellent fringe bene-  
fits (health and dental insurance  
and liberal vacation and sick leave),  
but also her five years’ accumulated  
time toward a pension.

Sure that she had a good case—  
based on an intolerable work situa-  
tion that had not been adequately  
monitored and corrected by her em-  
ployers—Taylor filed for unemploy-  
ment insurance, and at the same time  
filed a charge of sexual discrimination  
because of unrectified sexual  
harassment against her employers  
with both the New York State Division  
of Human Rights and the Federal Equal  
Employment Opportunity Commission.

On November 6, 1980—after upwards  
of six months without an income for  
Taylor—Frank A. Digiacomo, adminis-  
trative law judge for the New York  
State Department of Labor, filed in  
Department of Labor his decision in  
Taylor's favor, and she was duly  
enrolled to receive unemployment  
compensation for the usual time  
period of 26 weeks.

By the summer of 1981, however,  
that had run out and Taylor was  
still unemployed and without in-  
come for another eight months until  
she was hired as a VISTA worker with  
the Chautauqua County Rural Ministry.  
For the past three and a half years  
she has continued to be employed  
through VISTA renewals as an out-  
reach worker connected with food  
services to the poor. She is current-  
ly the site supervisor of the local  
soup kitchen which provides daily  
meals at the noon hour for needy  
citizens of the area. During all  
this time she has enjoyed her work  
and she has been a concerned, caring  
and productive worker. And she has  
not, needless to say, found sexual  
harassment to be part of her job.  
BUT: she is working at minimum wage,  
much less than half of what she was  
making before being harassed out of  
the job she often said she “used to  
love." With the necessity to re-  
fund her employment each year through  
grant-writing, she is still, as she  
approaches her 50th birthday, not  
sure of permanent employment. More-  
over, she has lost six years of  
building on the “perks” of her form-  
er job: working towards a decent  
retirement, annual raises, chance of  
promotion and security of employment,  
and the chance to pull ahead econo-  
mically and in personal confidence  
that secure employment provides.

Now, six years after the combined  
suits were filed (with the Human  
Rights Division and the EEOC), things  
are finally moving forward. Early on,  
corroborating in essence the unemploy-  
ment judge's decision in Taylor's  
favor, the Human Rights Division found  
that there was "probable cause" in  
her case—that is, that her charge  
was found to be of substance and that  
redress on her behalf should be  
sought. Because EEOC guidelines sti-  
pulate that a case may be taken into  
Federal Court if a certain time per-  
iod elapses without settlement, the  
Taylor case is now going to trial.

The lawyer who is handling the  
Taylor case is Linda Cleveland of  
Buffalo, N.Y. She represented  
Taylor in the successful unemploy-  
ment compensation suit and thereby  
earned a large feather for her  
legal cap by effectively arguing  
a precedent-setting case in New  
York State. Although neither  
Taylor nor Cleveland got rich as  
a result of that decision, they  
certainly earned the credit for  
opening the door for women who  
have been harassed out of their  
just due in employment.

As a result of her work with  
Taylor's case—and of other suc-  
cessful prosecutions in sex dis-  
crimination matters—Cleveland  
is earning a reputation in Buffalo  
as the lawyer to hire in such suits.  
Yet, as Taylor's case illustrates,  
these cases have a long, dreary  
timetable; they are not popular  
with judges; they often have estab-  
lishment “big guns" as the advocates  
on the other side; the suitors—  
i.e., the discrimination victims—  
are mainly women of poverty, and for  
that read: "No funds with which to  
pay their lawyer." Nor do they  
usually have means or contacts  
through which to raise money. Mean-  
while, on the lawyer’s side, the  
cases require a great deal of hard  
work, especially those like Taylor's  
where precedent-breaking and new  
precedent-setting must be the results.  
Finally, the endless string of cli-  
ents who are the powerless, unhappy  
and downtrodden victims of the many  
real injustices of our society, and  
the endless immersion in such spirit-  
breaking and stamina-consuming issues  
can often mean emotional difficulties  
for the lawyer who accepts such cases  
—and especially when there is very  
little financial compensation forth-  
coming.

From the beginning of her trials  
with sexual harassment, Dale Taylor  
has had the strong support, both  
moral and financial, of the local  
chapter of NOW (the National Organi-  
zation for Women). For the fifteen  
years of its existence, the chapter  
(Northern Chautauqua County NOW) has  

kept at top priority a commitment  

to aid local sex discrimination  
cases. However, the chapter is not  
large and fundraising for such causes  
in a small, rural conservative com-  
munity is always difficult. Through  
a unique local feminist network,  
which sponsors an annual fundraiser  
for services to women, the local NOW  
group has received a small annual  
share for its legal defense work.

But there have been several such long,  
involved time- and money-eating cases  
in the last decade.

At least three times in the period  
since Cleveland took over Taylor's  
case, the NOW chapter has raised funds  
for lawyer's fees, aided especially,  
through application through the  
Rural Ministry, by two grants from  
the Western New York Presbytery.

Now, with the Taylor case approa-  
ching the last, long difficult mile,  
a new fundraising crisis looms. The  
immediate need is to raise close to  
$5,000 to pay what is owed and to  
continue the work. Beyond that,  
there will be still more to be pro-  
vided. Even though, if the case is  
won, the fees of the complainant's  
lawyer will be part of the settle-  
ment, for all these long years of  
its prosecution; the lawyer has to  
eat, maintain her home and business,  
and remain her productive, profession-  
al self.

And there is a further compelling  
point: for all these years the es-  
tablishment "big guns" have been  
earning hundreds, thousands and even  
millions of dollars in defending  
unjust employers from discrimination  
charges. It seems only just that  
the feminist lawyers who are willing  
—and they are rare—to take on the  
difficult cases must be paid, and  
paid appropriately on a professional

out that people who are not in  
power "are more progressive than  
the dominant culture would have  
you believe."

She ended by stating, "I will  
no longer let men intimidate me;  

I invite you to no longer let men  
intimidate you." As expected,  
questions from the audience included  
the topic of inclusive language.

Her feeling (and I agree) is that  
inclusive language in prayers, songs,  
and liturgy is a start, albeit a  
slow one, at dealing with sexism in  
the church, but it is better than  

no start at all.

Terry Hamilton was not only a  
wonderful replacement for Sister  
Marjorie Tuite, she was perhaps  
better in that she so convincingly  
and intelligently pointed out how  
racism and sexism are intertwined.

I felt very good about seeing a  
woman of color up in the pulpit  
addressing a largely white audience.

Four workshops followed the  
keynote address: Women in the  
Third World; Women in the Justice  
System; Economic Justice-Pay Equity;  
and Domestic Violence: Interrupting  
the Cycle. I will report on the  
two that I attended.

The featured speaker of the  
workshop entitled "Women in the  
Justice System” was Attorney Hollis  
Hite. She was President of the  
Women's Bar Association from 1984-  
86. The theme of her talk was that  
the judicial system still largely  
views women as passive and submis-  
sive. However, a ray of hope exists  
in a recent report put out by the  
N.Y.S. Task Force on Women and the  
Courts (see insert below). Also,  
she noted that over 90% of the  
attorneys are relatively new, since  
they have been practicing less than  
10 years. Also, every year more  
and more women are entering law  
schools.

The next workshop entitled  
"Domestic Violence: Interrupting  
the Cycle" was led by Kathryn  
Hussey, Coordinator of Human Ser-  
vices at Haven House, Buffalo's  
only shelter for battered women.  
According to Hussey, 95% of the  
victims of family violence are  
women (other victims are children  
and elderly parents). Yet it was  
only as late as 1977 that a  
battered woman could press charges  
against her husband.

Now, battered women are usually  
encouraged by the police to go to  
Family Court rather than Criminal  
Court, because the problem is  
still viewed as a family matter.  
Also, judges seldom refer abusive  
men to any battering/counseling  
program.

Rather than ask, "Why do so  
many abused women remain with  

abusers?", she felt we should instead  
question the institutions and the  
belief systems in our society that  
keep women in these situations. Also,  
sexism and oppression feed into vio-  
lence against women in that all of  
us have the potential to be in an  
abusive relationship. Thus, our own  
potential as victims should motivate  
us to take responsibility of being  
the voices for battered women.

scale commensurate with the value  

of the service they are providing.  
And beyond that, the Dale Taylors  
must win their cases.

Therefore, the local chapter of  
NOW is embarking on an unusual fund-  
raising appeal. By publicizing what  
has gone on in Western New York on  
behalf of Dale Taylor, the chapter  
hopes to raise $5,000 immediately  
to cover the necessary expenses as  
the case proceeds to trial.

Those who read this who would like  
to help, may do so by sending a  
contribution of whatever amount—  
even $1 will help—to

WOMEN AND THE COURTS  

In 1984, then-Chief Justice  
Lawrence H. Cooke established a  
23-member Task Force on Women and  
the Courts. Its aim was to study  
the role of women in the court sys-  
tem in an attempt to eliminate gen-  
der bias. Despite substantial ob-  
jections to the formation of this  
task force, it recently completed  
its study and a resulting lengthy  
report. The report studied how  
gender bias affects women who  
appear before the courts, women  
attorneys, and women (such as clerks)  
employed by the courts.

The Task Force's conclusions on  
women litigants are most distressing.  
Women who appear before the courts:  
1. Have limited access to the judi-  
cial system, largely because of li-  
mited finances.

2. Find the court environment in-  
hospitable (it's like an old men's  
club).

3. Lack credibility. Women who  
come into court are often viewed  
as whiners and complainers.

4. Suffer from the white, male,  
bias of most older judges, whose  
perceptions are limited.

Most women litigants go into court  
through the Family Court system as  
one of the following:

1. Women victims of domestic vio-  
lence. The Task Force recommends  
that the courts and judges be educa-  
ted about a woman's right to self-  
defense if she is a victim of bat-  
tering. Another recommendation is  
that every district in New York  
State should have a judge available  
7 days a week to issue temporary or-  
ders of protection.

2. Rape Victims. The Task Force  
said judges should be educated to  
empathize with rape victims,  
especially victims of date rape.

3. Women seeking a divorce. The  
Task Force recommends that judges  
have a greater awareness of the  
limited earning potential of women  
who have been homemakers, and who  
may only be high school graduates.  
Also, many of these women maintained  
the home while their husbands  
furthered careers or education.

4. Women seeking the enforcement  
of child support or seeking custody.  
The Task Force recommends educating  
judges as to the real costs of  
rearing and educating children.

The overriding message is that  
those powerful white, male and  
generally older judges need sensi-  
tizing and educating. N.Y. Chief  
Justice Sol Wachtler recently  
announced the formation of an  
“implementation team" to work for  
change. Their success—the improved  
treatment of women in the court  
system—remains to be seen.

Sources of information for this  
summary on Women and the Courts are  
the talk by Hollis Hite at the  
"Empowerment of Women" conference,  
and an editorial from the Buffalo  
News (5/11/86), which supported the  
findings of the Task Force.
