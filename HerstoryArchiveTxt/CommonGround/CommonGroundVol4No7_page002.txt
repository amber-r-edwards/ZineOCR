Justice  
With  
Dignity  

by E. R. Mann  

What happens to women who are ar-  
rested and convicted of crimes? How  
does the criminal justice system  
treat these women with respect to  
their children, their families, the  
circumstances which surround the  
crime and may have contributed to  
the criminal activity?  

Often a woman who is arrested and  
charged or convicted of a crime is  
whisked away into the “system” so  
fast she cannot adequately provide  
for the care, housing and custody of  
her children. Separation from her  
children damages the family unit,  
and hurts these youth because while  
the law seeks to punish the offender,  
her family often suffers, too, as a  
consequence. The "system" is also  
often incapable of promoting a change  
in these women's lives which would  
help them recover their dignity and  
self-worth, making them stable, con-  
tributing members of society who would  
cease to commit crimes.  

In 1986, ten women combined their  
compassion, vision, professional skills  
and talents to create a community ser-  
vice for women offenders with children.  
Women for Human Rights and Dignity, Inc.  
was created to help these women "get a  
better handle on their lives."  

WHRD offers support services, in-  
formation and life options. Its newest  
project is the Women's Residential Re-  
source Center which provides a family  
setting for ten qualified residents to  
serve their sentences. In this environ-  
ment, where they can see their children  
and participate in a broad spectrum of  
rehabilitative programs, it is hoped  
women will make substantive changes in  
their lives, and not only cease to com-  
mit crimes, but also learn to direct  
their lives in a successful manner.  

The person whose own vision and de-  
termination is putting this philosophy  
into practice is Jacquelyn Ross Brown,  
Director of the Center. She is a dy-  
namic, articulate woman who makes it  
clear there is neither an excuse for  
crime, nor any excuse for the legal  
system to dehumanize offenders or fur-  
ther demoralize or demean those women  
or their families. She feels strongly  
that a change of attitude and a reach-  
able, positive goal for an offender  
will ultimately change her actions and  
benefit her whole life and lifestyle.  
To achieve this success, a person must  
be motivated to change, and have the  
step-by-step, social, cultural and  
structural support services readily

Pro-Abortion,  

With No Apology  

by Joan Dickenson  

"I'm not pro-abortion; I’m pro-  
choice."  

Ever since I heard a woman speak  
these words a year ago, they've  
been haunting me. But I finally  
think I've figured out what she was  
really saying:  

It's bad to be pro-abortion, but  
it's okay (not good, just okay) to  
be pro-choice.  

We mustn't advocate abortion,  
only tolerate it.  

Abortion is not a good, but a  
necessary evil.  

Her words even remind me of the  
abortion platform I've heard from  
many politicians, from Geraldine  
Ferraro on down: "I'm personally  
against abortion, but I support a  
woman's right to choose."  

I've come to think the label  
“pro-choice” is a euphemism, a word  
to cover up something too unplea-  
sant to say right out. It's also  
an apology. We who label ourselves  
pro-choice are not marching with  
flags held high, chanting, "Free  
safe legal abortion! Free safe  
legal abortion!" We are skulking  
in a corner, muttering, "The anti-  
abortion groups have grabbed the  
moral high ground, but we still  
think a woman should be able to  
choose an abortion, if... if she  
chooses."  

Since Gloria Steinem said, "If  
men got pregnant, abortion would  
be a sacrament," we've gone back-  
wards.  

It's hard for me to write this.  

Since I wrote the first draft, it's  
been sitting at the bottom of a  
stack of papers, waiting until I  
felt strong enough to face the pro-  
ject of revising it. For one thing,  
as a reader of some two dozen fem-  
inist publications, I'm wary of  
starting yet another schism in a  
movement whose strength is our  
common experience as women. We  
have the sado-masochists vs. the  
"the-sexual-is-political" feminists.  
We have women against pornography vs.  
feminists against censorship. We  
have anti-militarists vs. women who  
insist sexism is the primary op-  
pression. We don't need pro-choic-  
ers vs. supporters of abortion on  
demand. To divide us further is  
not my intention.  

On a more serious note, coming  
out publicly as a supporter of  
abortion is scary.  

Yet speaking up seems more ur-  
gent every day. Violence against  
abortion clinics is escalating.  

According to the February Sojourner,  

"the latest incidents appear to be  
the first attempts to injure people  
rather than property." A package  

sent to the Feminist Women's Health  
Center in Portland, Oregon, was  
found to contain a bomb designed  

to explode on opening. Fortunately,  
the clinic's receptionist recognized  
it as a suspicious package. Police  
were alerted, and "three more ex-  
plosive devices" were found in the  
mail, “waiting to be delivered to  
two other clinics and a Planned  
Parenthood office."  

Until now, most attacks have  
happened after business hours, with  
the intent to destroy only property.  
"This is really the first time it's  
been clear that the intent is to  
kill people," said Nanette Falken-  
berg, executive director of the  
National Abortion Rights Action  
League. What's more, our president  
has made it clear he doesn't think  
clinic bombers are criminals.  

This is a war we are fighting.  
And no one wins a war by apologizing  
for her beliefs.  

The abortion movement has long  
had a flavor of apology. Remember  
the pre-1973 battle cry, "Free abor-  
tion on demand?" It's a far cry  
from that conviction, that certainty  
to "supporting a woman's right to  
choose."  

I think our mistake was to coun-  
ter "pro-life," the label that uni-  
fied the anti-abortion movement,  
with a label cast in the same mold.  
Perhaps calling ourselves "pro-  
choice" is, like calling the vagina  
and the clitoris "down there," a  
sacrifice we can't afford.  

Maybe, instead, we could label  
anti-abortion activists woman-killers.  
I suppose that sounds harsh; there  
are sensitive and decent people who  
honestly believe the destruction of  
an embryo is the murder of a baby.  

But they haven't scrupled to  
call us baby-killers. If abortion  
again becomes illegal in the United  
States, women will die. And naming  
the anti-abortion activist "woman-  
killer" puts the emphasis of the  
debate back where it belongs: on  
women's lives.  

We have abandoned the initiative.  
We have chosen defense, rather than  
assertion. We have apologized.  

We've also let the right wing  
set the terms of debate by acquies-  
cing in a skillful anti-abortion  
tactic: naming the product of con-  
ception a fetus, from the moment  
of conception on. The American  
Heritage dictionary says a human  
fetus is "the unborn young from the  
end of the eighth week to the  
moment of birth, as distinguished
