The question was—"How do you
pick the candidate who gets your vote?"
It was asked of two Western New York
women: Dr. Sarah Slavin, a political
scientist at Buffalo State; the
other, Hope Hoetzer, who does local
and statewide political work. "Who
will you vote for" was not an issue
for this discussion.

Both Hoetzer and Slavin are femi-
nists and make that viewpoint an
issue when choosing a candidate.
Neither will vote for or campaign
for any candidate that runs on a
Right-to-Life ticket.

They both felt that the press is
not a good source of information for
making a decision for or against a
candidate. Slavin said, “Women's
rights are not on the press's pri-
ority list in political reporting.
The analysts do not tie issues to-
gether, i.e. they report economic
cuts, but not that those cuts will
affect women, people of color, and
other non-powerful groups. Hoet-
zer said that the press is not a
source of trustworthy information,
that “political endorsements may not
be made with fairness in mind."

Slavin chooses her candidates
systematically. She checks for party
identification and may vote a party
line. Slavin expressed preference
for women candidates as a "matter
of fair representation," though a
better qualified male may get her
vote.

Hoetzer uses party affiliation
as a guideline, while applying some
basic criteria to the choice. The
first issue is viability—"can the
candidate get the job done?"

Slavin and Hoetzer advise voters

to check voting records for similar
issues, to see how the candidate
thinks. To check on a candidate
that is not an incumbent, Hoetzer
says that the voter should ask "how
will you get the job done? What
plan do you have to make this work?"

Another checkpoint is charisma.
"A candidate needs to be able to
connect with the voters to get her/
his point across. But, beware the
candidate that walks into a room,
takes the pulse of an audience, and
feeds them what they want to hear,
using all the right catchwords."

"Make sure that the candidate
speaks to issues that are salient to
the office that she/he is running
for; that they understand what the
position involves and that they have
the basic skills and knowledge to do
it."

Hoetzer says you should also look
at who is backing a candidate. Too
wide or too narrow a base of support
indicates problems. With a narrow
base of support, the candidate may
owe large favors to a small group of
people. A very broad base of support
may indicate that the candidate has
done some pandering.

"The candidate who bills her/him-
self as an 'independent fighter' may
be dangerous. She/he will be repre-
senting personal interests, not the
interests of the constituency." She
feels that aggressive independence
shows an inability to work in groups
or listen to others.

“Listen to a candidate that
addresses her/his critics, rather
than the supporters. They already
know the issues," said Hoetzer.

When voting in a race where the
candidates and issues are unfamiliar,
both Slavin and Hoetzer advise voters
to do a little research. Slavin
says to make phone calls or write
letters requesting information from
someone who knows those issues and
that candidate. Party headquarters
welcomes questions. "They'll give
you good answers, because you've got
a vote that is looking for a home,"
said Hoetzer.

Slavin says, “Never believe that
an elected official or someone who
is seeking office is unapproachable.
Their careers depend on being
approachable."

If you have concerns that you feel
are not being met by the official in
office, Hoetzer and Slavin suggest
that personal contacts be made.

"Write a well thought-out letter
stating your concern and your opinion.
Follow your letter with a phone
call. If there is no response, make
an appointment—ask to see a legisla-
tive aide. Use personal connections—
maybe a friend or acquaintance who
knows the official can help you make
a contact."

If you have a special interest,
meet your candidate or official at
a rally, meeting, or social affair.
"If you want to be remembered, meet
the official on a campaign, prefer-
ably hers/his," said Hoetzer.

Keep up regular contact. If you
like the way an official voted on
an issue important to you, write a
thank you note or make a supportive
phone call. "Supporters are remem-
bered much more than someone with a
complaint," says Hoetzer.

If you disagree with an action
taken by your representative, let
her/him know why. Friendliness is

RE-VIEW

Much was written and spoken about
the nurses' strike which began last
May at Buffalo General and Deaconess
Hospitals. Seldom has a strike in
progress in Western New York received
that degree of publicity, both pro
and con. After the settlement in
July, the Buffalo branch of the
National Organization for Women took
the occasion of their September
meeting to provide a retrospective
of the events, the speaker being
Patty DeVinney, a Nurses United member
and organizer.

Ms. DeVinney began by explaining to
the group some of the background of
Nurses United, emphasizing that it
began as, and still is, a grassroots
organization. When nurses began to
feel that a union was needed, they
first considered organizing indepen-
dently. The costs involved with this
proved prohibitive, however, and they
then began to look into joining an
appropriate, already organized union.
The Western New York Council of
Nursing Homes was considered a pos-
sibility, but those who went to the
interview with the male head of this
group felt that they would not have
enough of a voice in this union.
DeVinney said, "He, in effect, patted
us on the head and said ‘we'll take
care of you girls, don't worry', but
later, when we turned him down, lob-
bied against our union."

After checking into various other
possibilities, organizers chose the
Communication Workers of America, as
this group was very supportive, pro-
viding funds and skills for organi-
zing, but allowing for independence.
"B.G.H. actually helped the union
formation," said DeVinney. "When they
put out their line about let's keep
this 'one big happy family’, but
made no change in working conditions,
more nurses became pro-union.”

"Buffalo General did not take us
seriously until it came time for a
union vote," she continued. “Then
they hired a Rochester law firm noted
for union busting. They did a lot
of lobbying of nurses, but we won
the election anyway."

The bargaining then began, Herb
Dibble representing the hospital.
Meetings were few and brief, said
DeVinney, and no concessions were made
in these initial talks. "Nurses hoped
that a strong strike vote would con-
vince the hospital of the serious-
ness of their views, and they would
not actually have to walk out." But
in February, the same law firm from
Rochester had been brought in again,
and the strike day was set for May
Day.

"The administration still seemed
to think 'just wait a few days and
they will go home'. They were not
prepared for a three-month walkout."
But the majority of the nurses were.
