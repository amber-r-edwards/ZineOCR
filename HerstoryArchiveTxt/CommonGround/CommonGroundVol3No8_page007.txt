iIWOD 85 Show,

by Kay Patterson

The ballroom of the Franklin
Keystone Street YWCA was transformed first
to a candle-lit coffeehouse and
next to a bustling marketplace one
March weekend as Western New York
women celebrated International
Women's Day.

At the Friday evening coffee-
house which kicked off the celebra-
tion, Western New York poets, sing-
ers and actresses performed to an
audience of about 150 women.

Grouped into three sets, the
performers packed a wide range of
thoughts, feelings and styles into
a few minutes on stage to keep up
with the quick and steady pace of
the evening.

Performing were poets Cynthia
Brown, Nancy Jones, Maria Atkins,
Pamela Thomas, Bonnie Johnson and
Karen Peterson; singer Susan Cle-
ments, Madeline Davis, Marne O'Shea
and Iona Pendleton; and actress
Stiller Dawson.

The stage was adorned by a banner
of needlework squares crafted by
area women. That banner is to join
those of women from all over the
nation as they circle the Pentagon
during a women's march for nuclear
disarmament scheduled for August.

Artists Ann Murphy and Joyce
Cromwell also displayed their work
throughout the coffeehouse.

By Saturday morning, the ball-
room had become a marketplace and
bazaar, the bustling center of a
day of panels, workshops and marches.

In the marketplace, representa-
tives of women's groups as various
as Haven House for battered women,
Women's Action for Nuclear Disarma-
ment, American Association of Univer-
sity Women and the Coalition of Labor Union
Women distributed information on
social issues and social reform.

Other groups and individuals
offered sustenance for the body—
coffee, pastries, international
delicacies and even peanut butter
sandwiches.

EMMA, Western New York Women's
Resource and Cultural Center, and
Harrambe Books sold books and re-
cords, Common Ground sold newspapers
and Karen Fernandez, a local woman
sold jewelry.

The day began with the opening
of the marketplace and a panel dis-
cussion on the condition of the
women's movement in Buffalo.

Afternoon workshops included dis-
cussions on pornography, legal issues
in divorce, fat politics, women's
wages, lesbian images, the (Catholic)
sister today, international feminism,
the building of community at the
Seneca Women's Encampment, sexual
assault and choices in childbirth.

For those looking for an alter-
native to workshops, there were
two audio-visual presentations offer-
ed continuously throughout the
afternoon. One was the slide show
"Look to the Women for Courage,” an
analysis of the Seneca Encampment
by JEB. The other was "The Silent
Scream," an anti-abortion film with
a subsequent discussion by pro-
choice advocates.

When the gathering of information
and the discussion of issues was
finished, the approximately 150 par-
ticipants in the celebration went

on a Take Back the Night march
through the Theatre District of
downtown Buffalo as a protest
against violence against women.

The march and the celebration
ended with a candle-lighting vigil
on the steps of the YWCA. The
Buffalo celebrants were participa-
ting in an international triangle
of candle-lighting ceremonies in
Israel, Australia and Buffalo to
commemorate International Women's
Day.
