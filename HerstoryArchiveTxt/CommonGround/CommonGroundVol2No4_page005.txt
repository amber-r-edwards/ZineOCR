EMERGENCY ASSISTANCE PROGRAM FOR  
THE LESBIAN AND GAY COMMUNITY  

Metropolitan Community Church of  
Buffalo announced the opening of the  
Community Emergency Services Pro-  
gram (CESP), a program of emergency  
assistance for the gay and lesbian  

community of Western New York.  

Like others, gay people sometimes  

find themselves in need of immediate  
and short-term help due to emergency  
or crisis situations. CESP is di-  
rected toward meeting the needs of  
those persons in the gay community  
who "fall through the cracks" of  
traditional sources of help --  
those who may not be able to turn  
to families or mainstream social  
service agencies and churches for  
help.  

CESP involves three aspects:  

(1) a food pantry to provide food  
and personal necessities; (2) a  
Blessing File through which indi-  
viduals can donate extra household  
or other items to those in need of  
them; (3) and an Emergency Fund, to  
provide direct cash assistance in  
order to avert emergencies such as  
utility shut-offs, or to provide  
immediate needs not covered by other  
parts of the program.  

The CESP maintains a separate  
bank account, and all donations are  
used exclusively for the implemen-  
tation of CESP. Eligibility for  
assistance is based entirely on  
need -- church affiliations and re-  
ligious beliefs are not considered  
in evaluating need.  

For more information or to re-  
quest aid, call 688-9456 or  
689-0890.  

Donations to CESP are tax- de-  
ductible. Non-perishable food and  
personal care items can be donated  
to the Food Pantry by dropping items  
off at GLCC, EMMA, or at the Unitarian  
Universalist Church of Amherst.  

Cash donations can be sent (and  
checks made payable to) CESP/MCC,  
P.O. Box 114, East Amherst, NY 14051

NEW FEMINIST DISCUSSION GROUP  

On November 7, the first meeting  
of a feminist discussion group was  
held in Buffalo, and attended by 38  
women. The meeting was set up in  
an effort to provide space for  
women who identify as feminists to  
meet together for support and dis-  
cussion. The group will maintain  
a loose format, with discussion top-  
ics and activities being planned  
around the interests of the par-  
ticipants. A focus on examining  
the Women's Peace Movement and the  
Women's Encampments at Romulus, N.Y.,  
and in England was established at  
the first meeting.  

It has been tentatively set that  
meetings will take place every  
third Monday at Lafayette Presby-  
terian Church in Buffalo, at 7:15 pm.  
December 19 is the next scheduled  
meeting. Child care provided.  

Dear Common Ground Readers,  

The Buffalo Friends of the  
(Michigan Women's Music) Festival  
Committee want to thank Buffalo area  
women for their support of the  
Michigan Women's Music Festival.  
Almost 100 women attended the  
September 30th benefit slide show  
and Punk Mary Gemini concert.  

This and other benefits around  

the country were necessary to help  
pay debts from this year's festival,  
and to help purchase land for a  
permanent site for the festival.  

The organizers make every attempt  
to have a cost-effective event, but  
this has rarely been possible. -Ed.  

After expenses, we were able to  
send $306.00 to the We Want The  
Music Collective [which organizes  
the festival]. We just received a  
letter from the collective thanking  
all of us for our contributions.  

The Michigan women told us that  
they were able to make their critical  
land debt payment on time. They  

are now working on paying off debts  
from this past summer's festival and  
moving forward to Summer, 1984, the  
9th Michigan Women's Music Festival.  
We'll keep you posted, and thanks  
again for keeping the festival alive.  
If you missed the benefit and want  
to send any donations, send to:

Lyons Street, Mt. Pleasant, MI 48858

LETTERS  

Ed. note: The following is a response  
to an article on October's CG about  
the closing of Simple Gifts.  

The closing of Simple Gifts in Sep-  
tember was a loss for homeless and  
battered women in Buffalo as well as  
for the feminist community. The clos-  
ing of the shelter due to lack of op-  
erating funds must be particularly  
disappointing for the women who worked  
over the years to create and sustain  
Simple Gifts. But the analysis of the  
closing compiled by E.R. Mann in Common  
Ground, October, 1983, disturbs me and  
brings up basic issues that feminists  
must confront daily.  

As a feminist I am working toward  
the full equality of women politically,  
economically, in the family and in all  
other areas of society. But I am con-  
vinced that male dominance is so en-  
trenched that these changes, as well  
as a more equitable distribution of re-  
sources to all races and classes, will  
not come about merely through education  
and reform, but will require a restruc-  
turing of society... As feminists work-  
ing toward major social change, we are  
faced with a dilemma about where to  
put our efforts in both the short and  
long term.  

Shall we work within the existing  
social service, political, or medical  
systems that are hostile or indiffer-  
ent to our values and goals or shall  
we create alternative institutions  
and networks? If we work within the  
system we may be able to affect more  
lives, make broader changes and have  
more resources available, but the  
changes may be superficial and we may  
be forced to make personal ideologi-  
cal compromises to survive. If we com-  
promise enough to "make it" in a male  
dominated power system, will we retain  
enough of our beliefs and identity to  
promote effective change in the system?  
Will we as individuals survive personal  
loneliness and isolation?  

If we start our own alternative in-  
stitutions where we can retain complete  
control and maintain ideological pur-  
ity we may limit the scope of our out-  
reach and be ignored by the mainstream.  
But though isolated we may create an  
atmosphere where we can develop femi-  
nist ideas, receive personal support  
and find practical alternatives for  
social problems.  

Money is a constant factor under-  
lying our choice. On a personal level  
jobs within the system generally pay a  
living wage and jobs in alternative  
institutions require volunteer labor  
and pay subsistence wages. Collectively  
if we choose to set up alternative  
institutions we must fund them and if  
we refuse public funding sources to  
retain control we must rely on chari-  
table contributions mostly from the  
women's community. Yet feminists are
