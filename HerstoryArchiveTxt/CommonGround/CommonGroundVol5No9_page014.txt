Eastern Airlines has brought back
the "Fly Me" message. Their latest
ad campaign features a woman clad in
a bikini lying on the beach's edge.
The slogan above her outstretched
body reads, "If you don't like the
weather, change it." Eastern has
asked all flight attendants to wear
the buttons with this slogan on their
uniforms.

During the same time, Eastern's
management has been locked in con-
tract talks with its employees. Ac-
cording to conversations with the
predominantly female flight atten-
dants, they have already taken severe
pay cuts during the past year and
their disability insurance has been
reduced by 50%. In addition, they
are paid only for the flight hours
worked, which does not include the
boarding and deplaning of passengers.

Almost none of the recent press
attention has focused on the flight

attendants' situation. Tell Eastern |

and Texas Air, Inc. (Eastern's new
owners) that you want them to take
women seriously in both their mar-
keting campaign and in their em-
ployment practices. Write to:

On Sunday, February 16, 1986, the
New York Times ran an article called
“TV Turns to the Hard-Boiled Male"
on the front page of their Arts and
Leisure section. The author, Times'
media reporter Peter J. Boyer, writes
that the sensitive male is no longer
popular and that “the new male figures
on TV are partly a reaction to the
feminist movement." His examples
include the men of "Cheers," "Miami
Vice," and "Moonlighting." Glenn
Caron, producer of ABC's “Moonlighting”
says that he created the swaggering
hero of his series partly because he
"very much wanted to see a man on te-
levision."

Brandon Tartikoff, president of
NBC Entertainment, says "the audience
has shifted in its taste from the
Alan Alda-esque heroes, who wore their
sensitivity on their shirt-sleeves."

Write to these men and let them
know their analysis misrepresents re-
ality. To cite some examples: the
top-rated shows, including “The Cosby
Show,” “Family Ties,” “Kate and Allie,"
and "Cagney and Lacey" feature equality
between the sexes. The husband/fathers
in many of these programs are both ten-
der with their children and respectful
of their wives' opinions and actions.
Write your comments to: Peter Boyer,
New York Times, 229 W. 43rd St., N.Y.,
N.Y. 10036; 212/556-1234 and Brandon

ment, 3000 W. Alameda Avenue, Burbank,

If you're old enough to register
for the draft or join the armed for-
ces, this message is for you.

Are you concerned about Nuclear
War? Do you worry about U.S. in-
volvement in Central America and
elsewhere?

You do have a choice. If you
feel it is wrong to fight in a war,
you can't be forced into the mili-
tary. And you can't be forced to
stay there. That's right! You may
be required to register for the
draft, but the law says you can't
be drafted if you can show that your
feelings are sincere. Even if you
are already enlisted -- you can be
discharged if you think it is wrong
to fight in a war. That's called
conscientious objection or C.O.s in
this country. If you're thinking
about signing up, remember: you are
a lot more than a name -- that's your
life you're putting on the line. Now's
the time to find out what you're get-
ting into.

To learn more about your choices,
call: WNY Peace Center, 472 Emslie
Street, Buffalo, N.Y. 14212, 716/
852-2100.

The "Ad Hoc Committee in Defense

of Life," an anti-choice group based

in N.Y.C., has targeted the "Cagney &
Lacey" program, particularly its No-
vember 11th episode about abortion.
The Committee has instructed its mem-
bers to boycott the products adver-
tised because it believes the program
was pro-choice.

WomenSpeak, a half-hour weekly radio
program sponsored by U.B.'s Women's
Studies, presents contemporary national
and local issues of interest to women
and the WBFO listening audience.

The program explores issues that
affect women and their lives. Women
are given little opportunity to speak
in today's world, and more importantly
to be listened to. Women are exposed
continuously to interpretation of
their lives. Their problems and ex-
periences that are uniquely their own,
and understood by other women, often
receive misinterpretation from sources
other than their own voices. To give
a balanced view of women's lives to

a listening audience, WomenSpeak will
give an in-depth view of a single
issue during each program. The pro-
gram will be a magazine style format.
The discussion may be literary, dra-
matic, musical, analytical, sociolo-
gical, historical or a combination
of these. The program is aired on
alternating Sundays, at 4:30 PM on

FM 88.

Club, sponsored through the YWCA,
