> COMMON GROUND, SEPTEMBER 1985,  

A multi-racial, multi-ethnic,  
cross-cultural display of women's  
talent, Sisterfire is a celebration  
that is a bit different than the  
other music festivals. Held on  
June 22 and 23rd for the fourth time  
in Takoma Park, Maryland (adjacent  
to Washington, D.C.), Sisterfire  
is probably the most accessible of  
the women's festivals. It is held  
in an urban environment, so one can  
take the Metro or a bus and get off  
at the festival's doorstep, the  
Takoma Park Junior High; immediately  
you're in the midst of cultural di-  
versity.  

While "Michigan” is much more  
than a state in the union to those  
who see women as vital carriers and  
creators of culture, Michigan (and  
its daughter festivals—New England,  
Bloomington, etc.) becomes a town  
where the music is almost incidental.  
At Sisterfire, the musical stages are  
the prime focal points. Bernice  
Johnson Reagon of Sweet Honey in the  
Rock (she says they don't know when  

they'll appear in Buffalo again either)  

sees Sisterfire as an extension of  
the other festivals, open to whomever  
wants to come. “We're babies in  
terms of outreach, especially with  
Latin and Native American cultures  
and there is a need for women artists  
to perform in formats that are avail-  
able to the world.”  

This year's line-up sought to fill  
that need, featuring the Thunderbird  
sisters from the Shinnecock Indian  
reservation on Long Island and their  
powerful messages of land rights,  
governmental oppression, and the  
survival of the Indian nations; the  
Urban Bush Women, a performing artist  
company which uses theatre to ex-  
plore the struggles and traditions  
of Caribbean and African folklores;  
and the African National Congress  

Women's Section Poets and their  
poetic visions of the struggles with  
Apartheid. Cuban artist Sara Gon-  
zalez was prevented from appearing  
due to governmental red tape over  
her visa.  

Ferron was the most anxiously  
awaited performer and certainly was  
the Washington Press media star.  

Her Sunday afternoon set sought to  
pull the crowd in as she urged every-  
one to sing along, “let me know  
you're all out there." Ronnie Gil-  
bert the day before spoke of that  
same urgency, having discovered that  
"women's festivals allow us to see  
and hear one another. An artist's  
work is actually very solitary and  

we have to touch one another.”  

Sisterfire is the culmination  
of year-round efforts by Roadwork,  
Inc. which has set as its challenge  
to produce, promote, and present  
women's culture as it exists global-  
ly. Sisterfire has grown with that  
challenge since its first year (1982)  
when it encompassed one day with 25  
performers utilizing one stage. In  
1985 one had to make choices from  
three simultaneous stages, whether  
Round Robin workshops featuring Cas-  
selberry and Dupree and Toshi Reagon;  
the techno-pop duo of Diane Lindsay  
and Sue Fink; Kate Clinton's now  
classic humorist comedy; Mischief  
Mime's views of relationships, si-  
lently manipulating the audience's  
focus; or Susan Freundlich's solo  
set, combining American Sign Language,  
dance, music and poetry. Meanwhile  
the Marketplace bustles with over  
125 artisans and craftspeople.  

Sisterfire is a day-time festival,  
scheduled from 11 am to 7 pm rain or  
shine, with the only camping done  
by volunteer security or Roadwork's  
technical crews. The festival's  
statement of purpose stresses that
