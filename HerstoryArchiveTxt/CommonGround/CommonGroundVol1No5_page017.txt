Recipe  

Take two drops of desire  
mix well  
with a quarter pound of anxiety  

Add, little by little,  
alternating  
a cup of loneliness  
and a cup of beauty.  
Beat  
thoroughly and sprinkle  
with frustration  
Then relax and  
smoke yourself to sleep.

It is a place, midwifery  
Which I cannot remember;  
A mix of various sites my poems Mother:  

Where the night is never lonely,  
Where the river sings its song.  

It is a vivid photograph  

Of places in my mind  

Where I vacation in my dreams,  
Where I shall hide from time.
