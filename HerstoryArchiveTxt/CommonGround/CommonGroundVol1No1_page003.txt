WHO WE ARE from p.11

this paper as part of that trans-

ition. Few of us have formal
journalistic training, and only
some of us are writers,
academics, but we support each
other in what we have to say. We
have the skills to produce this

paper or the ingenuity to invent

solutions, as we discovered in
doing this first issue. We are
recent immigrants, second and
third generation, and are from
families whose roots go back to
the 1700s. We are currently a
predominantly white and English
speaking group, but are working
to increase Third World Women's
participation.
This is but a small slice of
who we are and how we identify
ourselves. This will change
as our membership does.

COVER DESIGN;

POLICY

PHILOSOPHY — Common Ground is potentially, with
help from Western New York women, a forum to
celebrate the rich diversity of our community. We view
the paper as a ribbon that may connect our
commonalities, our intersection points. We are inviting
you to participate actively in the building of a support
system for WNY women. We affirm our commitment to
enhance the lives of women on physical, educational,
spiritual, psychological, social and economic levels. We
want to present, fair-mindedly, the issues that concern
women, and information of value to women. We offer
Common Ground as a place where women can display
their art and personal literature, and review the
tapestries of their experiences.

EDITORIAL POLICY — Common Ground is especially
looking for articles which address the needs and
interests of local women.

1. Common Ground is a publication of news, culture
and dialogue from women’s perspectives.

2. News, Opinion, Analysis and Commentary will each
be clearly labeled as such.

3. We are seeking to provide accurate, straightforward
information of value to women.

4. We will intentionally not print or support
material that will harm women
or ethnic groups because of color, sexuality, religious
background, physical disability or economic situation.

5. While opinions expressed in Common Ground are
those of the authors and not necessarily those of the
collective as a whole, we do accept responsibility for
choosing what we print.

SUBMISSIONS — We welcome articles, letters,
information and announcements of interest to women.
Graphics, cartoons, art and photography will be
gratefully received. We especially invite women who
do not usually have access to traditional media —
women of color, differently abled, economically or
educationally disadvantaged, and those for whom
English is a second language — to write. Suggested
length of letters: 250 words. Letters must be signed to
be printed. We will, however, respect your privacy and
withhold your name if you request. Suggested length of
articles, commentary, analysis: 500-750 words. Please
type and double-space your work, 40 characters across.
If you do not have access to a typewriter, please print
clearly. In time we hope to have a typewriter, paper,
etc., available for those who request it. Include a
stamped, self-addressed envelope and work and home
phone numbers. Because we want to hear your voices,
if your piece needs to be edited for length or clarity, we
will call you/ask you to do it. Keep copies of your work.
We will try to notify you within three (3) weeks if we
intend to use your work. If we print it, we will give you
five (5) copies of the issue in which it appears. Artwork
should be black and white copies only, and
title/describe your work. We will copyright the entire
issue, but the copyright on each piece reverts to the
author/artist, so that she may decide where her work is
printed. Please request a style-sheet for further
information and guidelines if you want to write.
