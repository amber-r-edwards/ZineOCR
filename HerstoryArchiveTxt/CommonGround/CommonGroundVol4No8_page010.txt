PEN & INK BY RAZIA MUHAMMED

King Care Plan  
11-18-85  

-- six years and eleven months old.  

Lying here for six years, so still, so quiet,  

Almost a half life, it seems.  

Your head swollen from the assault on your body,  
legs that have never run; arms that will  
never hug the doll that sits by your head.  

An act of violence altered, permanently, your personhood,  
your personal system.  

No way to know how you ever perceived yourself or your reality.  

Basic to your life is your need to breathe. You struggle so  
every time we suction you.  

There is no ‘normal’ to assess here, no cognitive being to  
interact with.  

The hospital and its staff, the institution, replaced your  
blood relatives as your interpersonal system.  

You are fed, clothed, washed, medicated, suctioned and positioned  
within a schedule, as time permits.  

Your stimulation comes from our touching, from the TV left on.  

I react to you. We do not interact. Never to transcend to a  
transaction,  

But I too touch, talk gently, stroke your hair and wonder at  
your purpose, your role.  

I handle you with as much tenderness as I can. Do you know?  

Is your role to be a learning tool for group after group  
of students? The effect of stress so clearly marked  
on your body, stress of not moving, your wasting body.  
You were failed, the social system failed you: an incident  
of neglect, reported, marked on your records.  
The system does not yet adequately protect its victims.  
Maybe that is part of your purpose, to speak to future health  
professionals about child abuse.  
We may do better at protecting another child.  

Nursing Diagnosis: Potential skin breakdown, due to immobility--  
not really revolving around a King Transaction—-  
but vital to your life.  

Implementation: Bathe carefully, Check for red spots. Good  
oral care. Re-position every two hours.  

Evaluation: Carefully carried out plan without any problems.  
No red spots. A pretty good day.

K MART ON SUNDAY  

Early Sunday morning  

WELCOME TO THE TWILIGHT YEARS  

Get religious  

Get prestigious  

Throw the Clearasil away  
Hormones declining  
Wrinkles lining  

Middle age begins today.  

Two piece bikinis  
Freshman beanies  

Are sadly put away.  
Rubber stockings  

T-M joints locking  
Middle age begins today.  

Bones start creaking  
Bladder's leaking  

Are brown spots here to stay?  
Lubrication  

Medication  

Middle age begins today.  

Silver hair  

Medicare  

A physic every day  
Vagina drying  

Bouts of crying  

Middle age begins today.  

Sudden hot flashes  
Embarrassing rashes  
Hair that is dry as hay.  
Dentures clicking  
Eyelids ticking  

Middle age begins today.  

Flatulation  
Constipation  
An apple every day  
Hemorrhoids  
And other joys  
Middle age begins today.  

Doctor says “Nembutal...  

Lay off the Birth Control"  

I thought I'd never see the day.  
The moaning, the spasm,  

What an orgasm...  

Middle age begins today!  

Carol T. Nowicki  

across the grey litter and worn out parking lines  

we seeker wait in isolation  
under Ford and Chevy roofs  

an old man leans against the window pane  
tells an old woman who isn't listening  

about "them"  
"them" who keep him  

worn and ragged and leaning against life  

now we seeker come  
through doors and gates  
past the long line of heads  

bowed in Sunday adoration over murmuring machines  

money changers in this strange  
Sunday morning temple  

half mesmerized by such a landscape  

I wonder...how did we create  
these endless shelves?  
spawn such rituals  

"Thank you for shopping K Mart" Amen  
"A prize if we miss our part” Amen.  

What really scares me though  

is feeling as I go within this sanctuary  
that somewhere is a sacrificial altar  

burning me  
or else...the world will be gone  
when I return  

and I'll have no grass nor tree nor sky  

nor good brown earth  
to steady by
