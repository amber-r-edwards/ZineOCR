THE ISSUE IS SURVIVAL

A recent issue of the Buffalo
News Gusto section carried a
cover story entitled "The Women's
Movement--What Happened?" by

Karen Brady. The gist of the

story was that time, energy and

financial straits have hit the
women's community like a sledge
hammer.

We in the women's community
are still here, fighting the same
fights, saying the same things,
doing the one-step-forward, two-

steps back march that we were do-
ing in 1975. The gains, hard-
fought for and often small, have
kept us going for a long time.
And some of us go on, in spite of
adversity.

The largest, and scariest of
adversities in 1985 looks like
lack of available money for women's
publications, services and hard
goods. The Common Ground collec-
tive has received letters from
two ten-year-old publications,
Sojourner, out of Boston, and
New Women's Times from Rochester.
Both may cease publication, at
least temporarily, because of
lack of money. NWT and Sojourner
have skipped issues to cut losses
and both are asking for help in
putting out the papers and for
more money.

NWT has lost hundreds of sub-
scribers in the last two years.
Their editorial in the combined
October/November '84 issue asked
readers to tell them why. Do
women no longer need a publication
by, for, and about women? Is it
the publication content and style?

Sojourner's problem is differ-
ent. They cancelled an issue to
do fund-raising benefits, dinners,
and performances to raise the
money to keep the paper healthy,
so as not to have to do medicinal
operations somewhere down the
line.

In the last three years, sever-
al women's groups and services
have departed the W.N.Y. area
or died out entirely because of
the lack of funds. The Women's
Production Company, Simple Gifts
Shelter, The Battered Women's
Project, Wonder Woman personnel
agency and others no longer exist
because the traditional funding
sources dried up or contributors
had no more to give.

The South Towns Women's Re-
source Center, started eight
years ago to provide services to
women outside the city area, is
floundering because of financial
difficulties. They began as a

WOMEN HELPING WOMEN

This year, Buffalo NOW honored
three local women and one organi-
zation with the annual Women-
Helping-Women Award, at their din-
ner held December 19. The award =

recipients are: Women's Action for Nuclear
Disarmament, Marylouise Nanna,
Kathy Neville, and Esther Rae.

Esther Rae was cited for her work
in the peace movement.

In January 1982, Ms. Rae wrote
for information to Women's Party
for Survival (later WAND); Febru-
ary 1982 the first meeting of WAND
in Buffalo was held. Since then,
working for a time with Audrey
Mang and Sandra Dittrich, Ms. Rae
has helped WAND grow into a strong
and committed group. She has pro-
vided sensible, intelligent leader-
ship to WAND as an organization,
as well as compassion and concern
to the individual members.
Her efforts to bring peace to

all women and their children makes
her worthy of the 1984 Women-Helping
Women Award.

Kathleen Neville, who had been an
account executive at WGRZ, was
fired from that job in November
1981, as the culmination of a ser-
ies of retributions for her rejec-
tions of her supervisor's unsolici-
ted sexual advances. Ms. Neville
filed a complaint with the Equal
Employment Opportunity Commission,
and subsequently filed a suit in
U.S. District Court.

After a series of delays, Ms.
Neville's suit has been scheduled
for trial in early December. This
case is the first trial of a sexual
harassment in employment case to
be filed in Western New York.

Marylouise Nanna joined the Buffalo
Philharmonic Orchestra in 1966 as

first violinist. She has moved up
through the section, and often sits

as concertmistress in reduced

orchestra performances, or performs

as soloist on violin and mandolin.
Ms. Nanna founded the Ars Nova

Musicians in 1974. The Ars Nova
chamber ensemble, under Ms. Nanna's
direction, has promoted the work

of women composers and conductors,
including the innovative "Ladies
First" concert of all women com-
posers.

For her inspiration to other
women seeking to advance through
the male-dominated ranks of profes-
sional musicians, as well as for
the beauty her music brings to our

lives, NOW honors Ms. Nanna.

Women's Action for Nuclear Disarm-
ament (WAND) is a political action
committee formed to end the nuclear
arms race. It was founded by Dr.
Helen Caldicott and other concern-
ed women.

The Buffalo Chapter of WAND be-
gan in February 1982, and has
quickly grown to a membership of
hundreds. WAND registered over
3,500 new voters in the recent
presidential election campaign.

WAND does continuous public
education throughout the year...
WAND has participated in Inter-
national Women's Week, and has
sponsored workshops at the Seneca
Women's Encampment. The group
also promotes the Pentagon Ribbon
Project in Western New York, and
has sponsored the visits of
European women working for nuclear
disarmament.

The women of WAND have shown un-
tiring commitment and dedication
in their effort to move our govern-
ment to the side of morality and
common sense. Their conviction is
an example to us all. NOW is
proud to honor them with a Woman-
Helping-Woman Award.
