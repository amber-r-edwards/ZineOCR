Carol Reichert

at N.O.W.
Meeting

"What we need to tell them is
that they must trust a woman to make
the choice best for her life," said
Carol Reichert at a meeting of the
Pro-Choice Communications Network
on Monday, February 4th at the
Council of Churches.

Ms. Reichert is director for
Family Planning Advocates, an organ-
ization in Albany that educates and
lobbies on pro-choice issues. She
was in Buffalo to discuss strategies
for dealing with anti-abortion
groups.

"Seventy-one per cent of the
people in this state believe that
abortion is a woman's personal deci-
sion," she said, "so why do these
groups have so much power?"

“We have been too lady-like for
too long, we have got to retrieve
our herstory, remind people of the
coat hangers, the lye and coke bot-
tles. Remind them of what and who
has been lost."

Ms. Reichert presented what she
believes is the strategy that the
anti-abortion groups have been using
to push reproductive rights under
the carpet. "They are making sub-
tle shifts on their points of opposi-
tion. They are moving away from the
legislative approach, because it has
been unsuccessful for them, toward a
more grass-roots approach. Harass-
ment of clinic workers and women
who are having abortions, the clinic
bombings, proselytizing from the
pulpit."

"Their target group in this new
direction is the mushy middle of the
road people. They are shooting for
all or nothing for that middle of
the road support, looking to persuade
that group of people who think that
abortion issues have nothing to do
with their lives," Reichert said.

In order to find these people,
both Catholic and fundamentalist
Protestant groups have made an uneasy
marriage. She added, "We must look
at the hierarchy of these churches,
not the laity, as the foes in our
fight."

“The Right-to-Life hierarchy is
giving tacit approval to these bomb-
ings and harassment. Every clinic
that has been bombed was also picket-
ed," she said.

"We must use their tactics--be as
symbolic as they are--bring out our
coat hangers and knitting needles
and use them to pin our demands for
safe, legal abortions on church doors."

"We need to say that we have all had
abortions. Women whose abortions
were life-affirming, good decisions
for them must stand up and say so."

Carol Reichert emphasized the ne-
cessity for moving the rhetoric of
abortion away from the fetus and
zeroing in on the lives of women.

She said, “Ask the right-to-lifers
if the lives of embryos are more im-
portant than the rights that women
are purported to have."

“Our rights to safe, legal abor-
tions are being threatened. We must
act now, if not now, will we ever
be able to act at all?"

"These rights were graciously
given to us by men in robes. They
are being threatened by men in
skirts who have removed themselves
from the lives of women. We can
not let them take them away."

address and significantly reduce the
problem of adolescent pregnancy, and
the Board of Directors of Planned
Parenthood in Buffalo has concurrently
been examining the facts on adolescent
pregnancy, abortion and childbearing
in Erie County.

Facts uncovered include these:
*Last year, one of every 12 teenage
girls between 15 and 19 years of
age in Erie County experienced a
pregnancy. Within certain areas
of Buffalo, the figure was one of
every ten.

*Erie County's rate of teen pregnancy
ranks fifth highest of all 57 upstate
New York counties.

*72% of all 1983 live births to teen
mothers in Erie County occurred out
of wedlock.

*In Planned Parenthood's own clinic
operation, a survey has indicated
that less than 2% of teenagers pre-
sently come for family planning ser-
vices prior to initiating intercourse.
*The risk of death during childbirth
for a teenager is 2 1/2 times greater
than for women in their twenties.
*Five years after the birth of their
first child, two-thirds of teen
mothers will not have finished high
school. Pregnancy is the leading
cause of female high school dropouts.
*30% of adolescents who were preg-
nant once became pregnant again with-
in two years. Last year, second or
subsequent births to 15-19 year olds
in Erie County represented almost
18% of the total live births in this
population group.

Gay Rights

The Supreme Court is shortly to
rule on what may be the most import-
ant gay-related case of the century.
The case is National Gay Task Force
(NGTF) vs. the Board of Education of
Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.

The case began in 1978 when the
state of Oklahoma quietly passed a
bill which permitted the firing of
teachers, student teachers and tea-
cher's aides for engaging in public
homosexual sex acts, for coming out
publicly, and for publicly sup-
porting gay rights legislation. Any
advocacy of gay rights or support for
gay lifestyles, in or out of school,
by homosexuals or heterosexuals,
which might possibly come to the at-
tention of students, was grounds for
dismissal.

The law had a chilling effect.

Some gay teachers gave up their member-
ships in gay rights organizations,
and retreated further into the closet
or sought other professions. Sympa-
thetic heterosexuals were afraid to
speak out. The fear was so great that
when the bill was appealed on the
district level, not a single gay or
lesbian teacher could be found to act
as an openly gay plaintiff. So NGTF
acted as plaintiff on behalf of the
teachers of Oklahoma and provided
legal resources.

In March, 1984, a Federal Court of
Appeals struck down the portion of the
bill penalizing gay rights advocacy,
ruling that it violated the consti-
tutional right to free speech. The
Board of Education appealed the de-
cision and the Supreme Court will hear
the case in early 1985.
