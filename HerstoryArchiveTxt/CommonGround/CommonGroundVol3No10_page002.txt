Nicaragua Today

by Judith Geer

Buffalo resident and community
activist Robbie Billingsley spent
3 weeks in February of this year
on a study tour of Nicaragua.
Robbie's interest in Central Amer-
ica and Nicaragua in particular
stem from an abiding interest in
other cultures (she has a degree
in sociology) and from her brother,
a journalist assigned to cover the
events in Central America for the

past several years. Below is an
interview with Robbie which was
conducted on March 17, 1985. You
will notice from the transcript
that I rarely had to ask any ques-
tions since information she
offered was abundant and totally

absorbing.

Part I

JG: What kind of a tour was this
and how long were you there?

RB: It was a Marazul Study Tour.
The tour itself was two weeks but

I stayed on another week. We went
to a lot of different places in

the country! We were based in
Managua, but we went to Matagalpa,
Masaya, Estelí, Granada. We went
to Bluefields on the Atlantic
Coast which is very hard to get to.
There are different tours and they
leave about every two weeks. They
also have work groups which go down
there, usually in December and
January to pick cotton and coffee.

JG: Did you feel you could go any-
where while you were there?

RB: Yeah. The only places we
couldn't go were up to the front.

If you had a press pass you could
go up to the front. Also, the Wit-
ness for Peace people always go to
the front: That's where they go.
They stand there and pray. That's
considered very laughable by people
in our group, but actually I suppose
that's as good as anything else

we do. Also it was difficult to
get to Bluefields; we had to have
special permission to get there.
Other than that we could go any-
where we wanted. People were very
open with their opinions. We

talked to some people who didn't
like the Sandinistas and they didn't
seem the least bit worried about
telling us about it. I would say
the Sandinistas are very popular,
though, because 99% of the people

we talked to were very pro-the
government. The people who were not
upper-middle class and who had had
their lives changed a great deal.
Before, they'd been able to buy
anything, now there's a great short-

age of goods, everything's rationed.
The war is hurting them and they
resent it.

JG: You talked about the doctors
once before in a previous conver-
sation with me and what had hap-
pened to them.

RB: We had two young doctors on
our tour and everywhere we went
they sought out the doctors and
hospitals and they wanted to talk
to everybody. So, in Corinto we
were walking down the street and

we found this doctor's office and

we went in and he was a very nice
man. We asked whether it was

better for him before or after the
revolution and he said, “Oh, before,
definitely." We asked if he liked
Somoza better and he said, "No,
Somoza was a gangster. You don't

have to like Somoza just because
you don't like the Sandinistas."
Later I was talking to a member
of the Liberal Party who is a gyn-
ecologist. He didn't care for
the Sandinistas at all but he

certainly didn't like the Contras
any better. I asked him why a

doctor would prefer the old way and

he said, "Well, things were very
different for doctors. Doctors
were not Somocistas, but they lived
very comfortably and the govern-
ment didn't bother them and they
didn't bother the government.

They had nice incomes and they
could buy any kind of consumer
goods that they needed. With the
shortages now they are suffering,
they can't buy things like they
used to buy." He also said that

in the old days they could work

two hours a day and now the Sandin-
istas make them work six hours a
day, which he didn't care for. An-
other thing he didn't say, but

made very clear and amused me was
that the profession of being a doc-
tor was not quite as elite as it
used to be. We had picked up a
young doctor hitchhiking, who was

a soldier. He was in medical
school. Apparently on their vaca-
tions from medical school they go

to fight at the front. He said
that he came from a poor family and
that medical school only costs
three cordobas a year which is

the equivalent of 6¢, which is, you
know, I would call that a free
school. He said many poor people
now could go to medical school
which they'd never been able to do
before. When I mentioned this to
Lombardo Martinez, the gynecologist,
he said, "Well, but they're just
general practitioners, they're not
specialists like us." It used to
be that only 100 people a year grad-
uated from medical school but now
they have so many; it was really
kind of funny. It was pretty clear
that he felt the profession was
getting downgraded with the large
numbers of rather low-class people
who were getting into it.

JG: What government officials did
you meet and what was your impres-
sion of them?

RB: We didn't really meet any

government officials, but we met

the union representatives, CST and
the ATC, unions that are very San-
dinista. 

JG: Now, what does CST stand for?

RB: CST is Sandinista Workers Union
and the ATC is the Association of
Rural Workers. They have different
unions. The other parties have
unions and the Sandinistas have
unions, but there's no question
that the Sandinistas are the bulk
of them. It depends on your pro-
fession what sort of union you be-
long to. We talked to various San-
dinista leaders but they weren't
government people.

We talked to a representative
of the Miskitos. She was the only
person who we thought was not tell-
ing the truth. That was very in-
teresting. We had never found any
one who hedged about anything
through the entire trip. Everybody
we talked to we said, “Do you like
the government?" and they either
said, "Yes, we like the government,”
or "No, we don't like the govern-
ment." But they had never hedged.
But this particular woman was a
Miskito. She was a teacher and
was hired by the Sandinistas. She
had spoken about the fact that the
Sandinistas had recently made a
speech which we'd seen printed in
the newspaper that there had been
many mistakes with the Atlantic
Coast people. They speak English
on the Atlantic Coast and they have
a very different culture from the
rest of Nicaragua, in fact, you
wouldn't even believe you were in
