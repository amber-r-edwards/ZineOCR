Slow pulse of streetlights

your face... in easy circles  
As after a hot bath  

c my skin still hums  
your face stays in my  

mind/how you looked that the space where your cheek

solemn brown eyes of my neck  

serious you were/your the arc of my ear  

face framed in the angle  
of my arm, in the  

curve of my hand/your eyes

It Does Something To Space That I Find Hard If Not Impossible To Describe  

The autumn sun  

does  

something  

the shadows  

longer and golder  

through back room window  
through crystal suspended  
purple light  

muted with reflected  

your eyes searching  

as if the  

red bricks across the alley  
held an answer  

between their cracks  

I slammed the door  

orange, green that day  

white my hollow steps  
The autumn sun Sheet Music like a hammer  
does echoing off  
something  

the gray cement road  

how is your sheet music. : : -  
again and again and again  

do you talk or sing  
loudly and off key.  

the shadows  
lazy but intense  

— I hear them today  
filtered through dirty do your words lay down still  

despite different curtains  
on your windows  
your patio door, closed  

on top of the air  

panes white light  
and get into ears  

broken and grabbing  

in an easy way.

but something livid  
and sensuous
