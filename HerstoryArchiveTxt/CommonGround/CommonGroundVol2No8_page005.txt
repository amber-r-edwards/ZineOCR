WARNING: Reading This Book May  
Generate Pure Lust! In the treacherous  
decade of the ‘80s, Mary Daly  
spins/weaves a remarkable tapestry. As  
readers, we move screaming, kicking,  
laughing weirdly, through the  
narrow/vast channels of Elemental  
Feminist Philosophy, as Daly probes our  
sensitivities while confronting us  
painfully, lovingly, joyfully with  
Truth. PURE LUST, more than her pre-  
vious Beyond God the Father or  
Gyn/Ecology, names our Other reality,  
truly “an invitation to the country of  
the Strange. For the Strange is a  
homeland of women who identify as  
women.” Mary Daly speaks more clearly  
than ever, to all women, the community  
of women, the Race of Women. She  
clarifies, leads us through labyrinths  
of confusion, brilliantly spiraling as  
we read further into clarity. More  
than ever before, she moves us lyri-  
cally, melodically into spheres of  
Knowing.  

PURE LUST travels through three  
Realms of Spheres. Archespheres - the  

Origins;  
Realm of molten Passions that supplies  
E-motional energy; and finally  
Metamorphospheres - the Realm of  
graceless/graceful transformation.  

In/through Daly fashion, the  
Introduction lustily defines language  
that is used in the Journey through  
each Sphere. The female Naming that  

was envisioned in Beyond God the  
Father, and began to take Shape in  

Gyn/Ecology is here brought to full  
"studied errata," exposing double-edged  
labryses of meaning far beyond what we  
might have imagined earlier. Daly sta-  
tes "this work unfolds a deviant philo-  
sophy, and a philosophy for deviants."  
In a patriarchal world where women are  
defined as deviant, this is a proud and  
wonderful thing to behold!  

Each chapter begins with  
definitions of two words used in the  
radicalizing process of Naming - one  
from a traditional dictionary, and one  
from Webster's First New Intergalactic  
Wickedary of the English Language. It  
is impossible, in a review of this  
book, to interpret the meanings of the  
Words, or to translate the experience  
that this Naming calls forth. The phi-  
losophic analysis that accompanies the  
Naming is deep, it is complex, and it  
is volcanic. It calls forth Knowing  

when once exposed, seems all too  
obvious.  

Each Realm begins with revealing  
the Foreground - that which is  

constructed by phallocracy to  
blind/bind us into erasure of Knowing.  
From each Foreground, Daly spirals into  
Spheres of Elemental Be-ing, contrasted  
with the elementary lies of the  
fathers.

PURE LUST contains an incredible  
richness. One theme that recurs is a  
revelation of foreground feminism,  
pseudo-feminism, and horizontal  
violence perpetrated by women against  
women - sometimes those who call them-  
selves feminists. With an analysis  
more radical, more extensive than we  
have ever seen, Daly shows how the hid-  

den agenda of the politics of "the  
women's community" is often, at its  
core, male identification, which is  

mal-identification.  

Book Review  

ELEMENTAL  
FEMINIST PHILOSOPHY  

Pyrospheres - the purifying  

Daly warns that the second coming  
of the witchcraze is inevitable in the  
context of patriarchy, and traces how  
we have been thoroughly trained in  
sado-society to “do it" to one another.  
She notes: "The most effective means  
employed by males to induce women to  
perform this dirty work has been and  
continues to be the manufacture of  
illusions which trigger the mechanism  
of Self-hate and horizontal violence  
among women."  

Daly speaks with sharp clarity  
directly to the women's community. She  
exposes, in one section after another,  
all too familiar cobwebs of phallocracy  
that haunt us in our interactions with  
one another, and our vulnerability to  
horizontal violence. She shows how we  
all participate in horizontal violence,  
and in so doing perpetuate the cowardly  
device of scapegoating other women -  
rather than confronting real danger or  
naming the real threat, promoting among  
women the very atmosphere of stigmatiza-  
tion and hatred which endangers all  
women.  

Another recurrent thread is that  
the Race of Women is an endangered spe-  
cies, along with Mother Earth, and all  
who live in the necrophilic, nuclear-  
maniacal thrust of the fathers. Again,  
Daly began this analysis in her  

previous works, but here she examines  
the archetypal, archaic depths to which  
this phallic lust extends, reaching far  
into our past, present and future.  
Throughout PURE LUST runs a theme  
of ecstasy, hope, Elemental Lust of/for  
spiraling change, a transformation con-  
juring the Elemental Spirits of women,  
conjoining women with our Selves and  
our Sisters, and with earth, air, fire  
and water. One "small" step, which is  
the critical step toward this change,  
can be a slight shift of degree that  
converts constrictive ruts into a  
spiraling path, moving us into the  
Realm of Metamorphosphere. Daly states:  
"In its true and radical sense, femi-  
nism is a verb. It is female being."  
Hags/Nags recognize the ultimate traps  
of pseudo-feminism, and embrace instead  

Be-longing, Be-friending, and Be-  
witching.  

A serious/humorous highlight of the  
book is nonchapter thirteen  

-Cat/egorical Appendix. "Cat/egorical  
means pertaining to a cat/egory. A  
cat/egory is an allegory written by and  
for cats and their friends. A  
Cat/egorical Appendix need not be read  
by anyone else." Here her cats, Ms.  
Wild Eyes and Ms. Wild Cat engage in an  
interview with Professor Yessir of the  

Department of Ology, College of  
Knowledge. Once having traveled the  
domains of the Realms, reaching  
nonchapter thirteen is a treasure,  

wonderful, erratic wit.  
You need not be a Daly scholar to  
appreciate, learn and grow through PURE  
LUST. It is helpful to have read her  
previous works, but it is certainly not  

necessary. For those who have read the  
other books, PURE LUST will be a  
wonderful extension, a focusing, a  

leap into a new Realm. For those who  
are beginning an acquaintance with  
Daly's work with this book, as she  
says, "nothing is really lost to those  
who Lust."  

Poet's Corner  

When black  
ponderous thoughts  

drag me down  

I should know by now  
the next wave is on its way  

to push me forward  

If I'm ready  
if I regain control  

I can swim with that wave  
as it rolls
