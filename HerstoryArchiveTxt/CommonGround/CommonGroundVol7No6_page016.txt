Pro-Choice in Action

Keep the Clinic Open!

BUFFALO - As national attention has been focusing on the anti-choice/anti-abortion demonstrations at women's health centers and abortion clinics, the Queen City has mustered an impressive crew

of dedicated Pro-Choice activists to counter-demonstrate in favor of a woman's right to choose. United by the Pro-Choice Communication Network, and supported by community organizations like Buffalo & Erie County N.O.W., the PCCN has led the fight locally against the anti-choicers with speak-outs, informational meetings, mail campaigns and out in the streets with marchers to let the rest of the community know

that the pro-choice majority will not be intimidated by the tactics of threats and blockades.

Their latest action, dubbed “Keep The Clinic Open", was a direct action in front of the Elmwood Avenue Clinic, to head-off any potential anti-choice attempt to prevent women from free access to the clinic. Early in the morning of January 21, about 45 PCCN activists arrived at the Elmwood Clinic to forestall an anticipated anti-choice demonstration in "honor" of the anniversary of Roe v Wade.

Their plan was to escort clinic patients in, and form a human corridor if necessary, to keep the clinic doors open.

The Clinic staff offered some refreshments and their support to the demonstrators.

The plans for the demonstration were kept confidential until the last minute to foil any attempts by the anti-choice forces to undermine their presence.

As it was, none of the anti-choicers showed up. One of the demonstrators offered her opinion: "They all must have gotten into buses to go to another city -- maybe to the Washington march." She said that the PCCN demonstrators had a good time and quite visibly reminded clinic patients, the community and passers-by that there was indeed genuine support for choice here in Western New York, and that the anti-choicers were not really representative of the WNY community on the issue of abortion access.
