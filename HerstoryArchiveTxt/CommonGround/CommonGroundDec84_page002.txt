DECEMBER 84

EMICK

Leslie Ann Emick, whose plea of
self-defense in the shooting death
of the man with whom she lived was
not accepted by jurors in Alleghany
County, has had her conviction over-
turned by an appellate court in
Rochester. She has been granted a
new trial on the 1983 first degree
manslaughter charge.

The court said, in a 24-page
decision, that Emick's actions may
have been justified because of the
victim's alleged vow to kill her and
their two young children and himself
when he awoke on the day of the shoot-
ing. The panel of judges also ruled
that Emick's justification defense
"was not overwhelmingly disproved
beyond a reasonable doubt" during
her trial.

Emick had been sentenced to a
two to six year prison term on the
basis of Alleghany County's trial.

She was free on $100,000 bail at the
time of the decision.

The fact that Leslie had been bru-
tally battered by the late Marshall
Allison played a part in the new
decision—that she had been the
victim of increasingly violent at-
tacks and their effects
clearly described to the jury.

She is currently a nursing stu-
dent in Maryland, raising her two
children in her parent's home. She
has a job tutoring high school stu-
dents three days a week.

Leslie is also working with a
group of battered women. She says,
"I told them the only way to get
out is to get yourself out, and that
nobody will pull them out. I ex-
plained that the abuse only gets
worse."

Marital
Rape

The case of Mario Liberto, the
Buffalo laborer convicted of raping
his estranged wife, is drawing na-
tional attention this month, for
the case involves marital rape.

Nowhere in his plea for appeal of
conviction does it say that he did
not force his now ex-wife into having
sex with him. Instead, it says that
the N.Y.S. rape law, as it stands
now, is discriminatory, because it
does not penalize women for raping
men, and it discriminates against
husbands, because it creates a new
category for the law which makes such
men vulnerable to criminal prosecu-
tion if they force sex upon their
wives.

The law now defines rape as

Gender Gap Failure

WHERE DID THE GENDER GAP GO??

By Hope Hoetzer and Phillip Cook

For the past year, feminists hailed
the gender gap as the answer to a de-
feated ERA, threats to pro-choice leg-
islation, and an unsympathetic adminis-
tration. The much-touted "gender gap"
was the supposed difference in the
way women voted on issues from the
way men voted on those issues, and
was also supposed to make the differ-
ence in the 1984 Presidential Election
—concluding that women would vote
as a block for the candidate who
would support a feminist agenda once
in the White House. While it was not
expected that all women would vote
this way, it was expected that a
significant percentage of women would,
and that these numbers would then
swing the election, or be the margin
of victory.

Women's groups entered the politi-
cal arena registering new
voters, campaigning for Mondale (or
for issues that Mondale supported),
and reveling in the selection of
Geraldine Ferraro for a vice presiden-
tial candidate, as a visible sign of
women's new political clout.

On election night, despite gloomy
election predictions, feminists were
secure in at least the belief the
gender gap would show them strong,
and prove that women did vote sig-
nificantly differently than men,
overall. On Wednesday morning, the
statistics showed that 55% of all
women voted for Ronald Reagan.

What went wrong?

Where did the "gender gap" go?

THE REAL ISSUE IS AGE

An examination of the numbers
shows that there was a gender gap at
the ballot box; it was about 9 points
difference between all women and all
men. Among women 50 years and
older there was a three point gap.
In the 30 - 49 year old age group
there was a five point gap, and in
the youngest age group (under 30),
there was a sizeable 14 point gender
gap. The problem is the gap is not
really a reflection of women's sup-
port - it is only the measure of the
difference between men's and women's
support of a candidate or issue -
it is a ratio, not a measure of wo-
men's strength. It is a comparison
of women to men; not a measure of
women's unity among themselves. In
Erie County, for example, the gender
gap was only 6 points, because of
the smaller plurality of men who
favored Reagan.

Actually, the national figures
by age show that while women's
support for Reagan grew 5 points
men's support actually dropped
6 points, narrowing the gap further.
Therefore, what is only a 5 point rise
in women's support for Reagan by age
group ends up becoming an 11 point
difference in the size of the gender
gap between the youngest and oldest
age groups of women. What is signifi-
cant about the vote totals is not
the size of the gender gap, which
certainly does exist, but the fact
that 55% of all women voted for Reagan
and Bush. Mondale and Ferraro did
not get a majority of the women's
vote in any age group.

Dottie Lynch, pollster for N.O.W.
and Ferraro, noted of white women
that only young professionals were
strongly for Mondale. Black women,
like black men, supported Mondale 92%
so economics and race, not the gender
gap, were the key issues in the Black
community. There are those who argue
that the gender gap is male flight
from the Democratic party; however,
this view ignores the real question
of why a majority of women chose to
vote against what feminists would define as women's own interest. The problem really lies in whether
or not there is broad-based agreement
among women on what their issues are.

There is also the important ques-
tion of age and the feminist agenda.
Many younger women do not identify
with access issues and the job market,
seeing that entry problems have been
solved. Instead, they are more con-
cerned with upward mobility and the
development of a supportive "old
girls' network," believing that the
better positions, not comparable
worth, is the goal. Many middle-aged
women who are not career-oriented
found little to identify with in Ger-
aldine Ferraro, and were concerned
about economic and family issues.
Elderly women who were even less
career-oriented, and in any case out
of the job market, formed the strong-
est women's base for Reagan, indicat-
ing that despite concerns over bene-
fits, they did not identify with the
feminist image and argument on the
feminization of poverty.

If feminists are committed to im-
pacting on future elections, they
must be less concerned about the
gender gap and more concerned about
winning a majority of women to fem-
inist viewpoints. Blanket registra-
tion is not the answer. Approximately
the same percent of eligible women
voted as in the last election, and
blanket registration efforts that did
not determine issue support clearly
did not create a majority of women
sympathetic to feminist issues. We
