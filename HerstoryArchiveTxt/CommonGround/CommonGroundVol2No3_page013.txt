City people—women, young people, etc.—
are not prepared to get these jobs
because they do not have the skills
or because they are not union members.

It is not written into the current
agreement that any bond issue money
be used to help minority and women's
businesses get certified to work on
state projects either, according to
Murphy.

Whelan, however,
said he was for the bond issue.

Murphy concluded that, flawed
though it is, the bond issue was the
best the state could hope for, and
that while concerns expressed that
night were valid, it was too late at
this point to do anything about it.
Those opposed generally felt that it
would not really bring much money
or many jobs to this area, and that
while road and bridge repair was
critical, it was just as critical to
include ways to use that money to
help people.

1983 NATIONAL N.O.W. CONFERENCE REPORT

WOMEN MAKE
THE DIFFERENCE

Five local women went to the 1983
NOW national conference. There were
1348 delegates and 1000 others who at-
tended. They reported that the major
themes of the conference, titled "Wo-
men Make the Difference," were the
Gender Gap, ERA, Abortion Rights In-
surance Equity, and the 1984 elections.

Highlights of the conference in-
cluded a panel at which Democratic
presidential hopefuls, except Askew,
presented their campaigns for endorse-
ment by NOW. Various workshops were
held for participants on topics such
as Sex Discrimination in Insurance,
Lesbian and Gay Involvement in Election
Politics, The Feminization of Poverty,
Effective Voting, Fundraising, Women
in the Military, Male-Female Wage Gap,
The Gender Gap, Violence Against Wom-
en, Racism as a Feminist Issue, Wo-
men and Religious Institutions, Older
Women, and others.

One of the controversial

"hot top-
ics" of the conference was a proposed
resolution to support anti-steriliza-
tion abuse laws. (See La Operacion and
Sterilization Abuse Laws articles in
this issue for more info.) The issue
surrounded mandatory waiting periods
for sterilization consent. It is some-
times less trouble for a woman, and
cheaper, if the procedure can be done
after a delivery or after an abortion.
On the negative side, women can be con-
fused or upset at this time and feel
pressured to have it done then. Those
against a waiting period said that
imposing one is patronizing to the wo-
man, assuming she cannot make up her
own mind. Those for a waiting period
say it will cut down on sterilization
abuse.

Conference delegates came back with
a lot of information to share with the
community. They said that progress in
getting the ERA out of committee and
to full congressional vote was being
blocked by Orin Hatch. He has been
holding additional hearings on the ERA,
scheduling them at inappropriate times
when he (presumably) knows sponsors
cannot attend. He even scheduled them
during talks on the Korean Air Disaster.

Hatch is chairman of the sub-committee
on the Constitution and the ERA must
get out of his committee and to the
full Judiciary Committee before a
congressional vote.

Some of the delegates reportedly
felt that it was an “anti-Reagan" con-
ference, but most felt it was definite-
ly pro-women. The "Feminization of
Poverty" workshop made direct connect-
ions between his policy and the worsen-
ing economic condition of women.

It seemed one of the best things to
come out of the conference was the en-
ergy the delegates brought back home.
They each got something different from
the conference. Kathy Jackson felt
the issue of the Gender Gap in elect-
oral politics was very important, and
that women need to get educated on this
issue and use it to further women's
concerns. "The gender gap will make
people in elected office seriously con-
sider issues that affect women. So
many times it's lip service and not
commitment,” she said.

Dottie Harnish felt the conference
was important because it helped her
learn what the issues are and what the
priorities should be. "I was able to
educate myself and get plugged back
into the system. The conference got
me re-energized."

Paulette Hammond also felt that the
conference was personally good for her
because she found it energizing to be
with so many like-minded people. She
was particularly happy about the unity
and support she found there. “I was
happy that the abortion rights reso-
lution was passed, and the violence
against women resolution. I support
changing weak laws and calling for more
enforcement of the existing laws which
should protect women from violence in
their families. Every state should
have a marital-rape law."

Betty Riley said of the conference,
“One of the most important things the
conference emphasized was no change in
the ERA as written. No changes, no
additions or amendments, and no more
hearings about it." She thought that
going to the workshops was good for
her in that "it was good to see all
those women doing things. So very
few of my generation were there, but
I think I saw more there this year
than last.”

The delegates reported that the
conference delegates were mostly
white with not too many young or very
old women present. In the case of
Buffalo NOW, they stressed that it was
unfortunate, but the delegates ended
up being women who could afford to
go, because the conference was ex-
pensive, and there was no money to
support others’ expenses.

Doris Kent said, "The reason I
went is to be renewed in my feminist
dedication and to be stimulated to
work hard.” She felt that it was
important to get out and get a fresh
perspective. "If you stick around
(only your own area) you don't get the
stimulation you need."

The conference was judged a success
by our local delegates, and they hope
their experience will energize and en-
courage others to work on women's is-
sues.

(Next Month, Paulette Hammond will
report on her experiences throughout
the conference.)
