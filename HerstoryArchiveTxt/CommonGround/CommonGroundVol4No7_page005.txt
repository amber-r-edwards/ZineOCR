Childhood

by Anonymous

During the early 50's, because he  
didn't have a car, my father rode to  
work in a car pool, 27 miles to Hart-  
ford, from our small town in the foot-  
hills of the Berkshires. He was  
dropped off at the mailbox which was  
at the end of Shore Drive, our dirt  
road to Highland Lake, and he walked  
home from there. When I was about  
six years old, one evening before the  
sun went down, he asked me to fetch  
his jacket from our mailbox, and when  
I nearly reached it, a shiny red car,  
trimmed in chrome, pulled up beside  
me. The dark-haired man asked me if  
I would like an ice cream cone. He  
seemed nice, and loving ice cream as  
much as any kid, I said “yes," and  
I climbed into his car. He drove to  
the back woods and led me among a  
canopy of evergreens. He sat on the  
dead brown leaves and I sat opposite  
him. He undid his zipper and pulled  
out his penis, asking me to taste it.  
It was not like any ice cream cone I  
had ever seen before! I recall that  
I was not frightened, but something  
must have told me that this was not  
kosher so I lied and said my father  
was calling me, at which point he  
leapt to his feet and ran away. I  
realize now that I survived by in-  
stinct and lying. I made my way back  

Women’s Disorders

by Lynne Scribner

The American Psychiatric Asso-  
ciation is currently considering the  
addition of three "disorders" to  
their official list of diagnoses.  
These include two that directly re-  
late to women - self-defeating per-  
sonality disorder and premenstrual  
dysphoric disorder. The problem with  
adding these is that the diagnoses  
can be misapplied to women. In fact,  
these diagnoses can be damaging to  
the health of women.  

This debate is a very important  
one in that the "Diagnostic and Sta-  
tistical Manual of Mental Disorders"  
is used by researchers, insurance  
agencies, and the federal government  
and judicial system as a determinant  
of mental status. Briefly describing  
these two "disorders," the self-de-  
feating personality disorder is char-  
acterized by a person who repeatedly  
avoids or undermines chances for  
pleasure and directs oneself towards  
situations that will bring on suffer-  
ing. The premenstrual dysphoric dis-  
order is when a woman's work or social  
activities are seriously disrupted by  

symptoms such as crying, tension, de-  

pression and irritability which occur  
approximately one week prior to men-  
struation.  

According to Dr. Teresa Bernardez,  
a psychiatry professor who is director  
of the Psychiatric Association's com-  
mittee on women, the diagnosis of pre-  
menstrual dysphoric disorder appears  
to support the myth that women are  
less competent, more impulsive, and  
less in control of their impulses.  
Opponents of the self-defeating per-  
sonality disorder are against it be-  
cause it can be mistakenly applied

to the main boulevard where my father  
was frantic. He shook me from the  
shoulders and asked where I had been.  
I tried to explain. I wondered what  
sin I had committed, since people in  
our town were nice. We didn't lock  
doors and played in the streets well  
into the dark of night.  

Back at the house the police were  
cold and inquisitive -- "What did he  
look like; how tall was he; what did  
he do?" To this day I recall only his  
black hair. The members of my family  
were in a frenzy and the neighbors  
were curious for the rest of the sum-  
mer. When they asked me what had  
happened, I began making up stories  
because I didn't want to disappoint  
them. I have always been anxious to  
please. I told them that he was a  
wild man who had a snake in his  
pocket (I had never heard of Adam  
and Eve). Another time it was a  
huge snapping turtle that he had  
shown me. My stories pleased them  
so much that I embellished and re-  
vised them until in the end I didn't  
know fact from fiction. For the re-  
mainder of my school years I was a-  
fraid to get off the bus by the  
mailbox. I feared opening the mail-  
box and finding a water snake in it  
and I feared a car would pull up be-  
hind me. Each day I ran home along  
the laurel-studded road after school.  

A Debate of  

to abused women.  

It would seem to me that these  
diagnoses should not be included in  
the Psychiatric Manual until further  
research has been done to determine  
whether or not there is definite  
scientific evidence to support their  
inclusion. Too often a “disorder”  
has (mistakenly) found its way into  
such a manual and once this occurs  
it can be a long road to removal.  

There is already a medical  
diagnosis for the premenstrual dis-  
order and I think that by giving it  
the additional psychiatric diagno-  
sis women will be increasingly cat-  
egorized. Society will simply use  
this to repress women further (to  
"keep us in our place"). This re-  
verts to the way women were viewed  
in the 19th century -- as “hyster-  
ical beings." When a woman goes to  
her physician with such a problem,  
he will then have the backing of  
the Psychiatric Association in dis-  
missing her very real physical  
symptoms as a mental disorder. I  
can see this leading to women being  
shuffled through the medical-psy-  
chiatric system with no one willing  
to take the time to examine the real  
problem.  

The self-defeating disorder can  
affect a multitude of women and is  
not nearly as clear-cut as its de-  
scription may seem. It is not only  
the physically abused woman who falls  
under this category; many of us are  
also emotionally abused. This is  
part of an inherent aspect of our  
selves -- that women as a whole are  
not taught to be confident, self-  
fulfilled human beings. From our  
very beginnings we are steered on a  
course for self-defeat. It's no  
wonder there is such a "disorder."  

Psychiatry versus Feminism  

Good Scars  

I have a recurring dream about this  
incident. The uncontrolled emotions  
of the adults as well as the crimes  
of the men caused me to have guilt  
and fear; they made me feel I had  
committed an odious moral offense.  
After this, my parents over-reacted  
to almost everything.  

There were other incidents,  
though, which we as children saw no  
harm in. In one incident, there  
had been a policeman in one of the  
cottages who had a club that he  
asked us to feel and taste. He  
asked us next to taste his penis  
which flew at half-mast. We didn't  
do it. We never told our parents  
about this but stayed clear of his  
house.  

I've been on the run most of my  
life. Many times over the years I  
have felt I was being followed by  
police cars. When I was in Florence  
three years ago, my paranoia became  
unbearable. I imagined that the  
dark-haired Italians were trying to  
steal my pocketbook while I was  
looking at Michelangelo's "David."  
(How Freudian can you get?)  

I believe my early childhood  
happenings are a source of the fear  
and paranoia from which I suffer  
occasionally, and it is only now,  
in middle age, that I am beginning  
to deal with it.  

It would be far better to work on  
changing that perspective so that  
in the future, women will be less  
vulnerable to abuse and will have  
the confidence necessary to build  
and lead more productive lives.  

I do not see women benefiting  
from the addition of these “dis-  
orders." As I have pointed out,  
I can, however, see several nega-  
tive reflections for women. With  
the current knowledge available,  
inclusion of these would serve no  
meaningful purpose to women. In  
the future, after more research has  
been done, there may possibly be  
justification for their addition,  
but until that evidence is clear, I  
feel their inclusion in the Psychi-  
atric Manual would be a detriment  
to women.
