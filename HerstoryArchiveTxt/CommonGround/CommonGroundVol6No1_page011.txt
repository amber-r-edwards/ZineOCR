Women's Music Symposium

in Buffalo: Superbly Done

by Joanne L. Schweik

It was a first for Buffalo—
the Women in Music Symposium
held at the State University
of New York at Buffalo on July
11-13, 1986, organized by Dr.
Barbara Harbach of the University
Music Department, with the joint
support of the Music Department
and the State University of New
York's "Conferences in the Dis-
ciplines."

How often has it happened in
the last decade that a program
such as this one, offering quite
extraordinary programming and
exploring an area new to most of
its possible constituents, has
been held, successfully, to the
enthusiastic response of its
participants, and yet with an
audience so small that those
present can only mourn the beauty
of the experience missed by
those who did not attend?

Never mind. The Women in Music
Conference at UB this year was
wonderful—by all reports. Even
the reviews of the concerts in
the local media attested to that.
The BUFFALO NEWS' Thomas Putnam,
for instance, said: "...for
musical reasons it [the conference]
will not be forgotten too quickly,
and for feminist reasons it may
not be forgotten quickly at all."

For this reporter it was the
third such three-day, jam-packed
women's music conference attended—
the first, a showcasing of

about twenty string quartets by
women composers held in New York
City several years ago; the second,
a similar event—the first of its
kind nationwide—at the University
of Michigan in 1981; and now this
one. I was delighted, attending
the first day as both an enthusias-
tic and expectant spectator/listener
and as a participant (I gave a
paper during the Friday afternoon
session) to find myself responding
with beyond-the-expected positive
approval, of which I will say more
later.

To Barbara Harbach's credit,
the program was a stimulating one,
including a first day that began
with a panel-performance by a
poet, the composer who set her
work to music, and the performer
who sang the works. In more than
30 years of conference attendance
—ranging from professional meet-
ings through scholarly conferences
to feminist gatherings—I have
seldom been so delighted and so
moved as I was (and the rest of
the audience seemed to be with
me) by the dialogue between Patsy
Rogers (poet), Nancy Dean (compo-
ser), and Lucille Field Goodman
(soprano/performer) on the inter-
play of creative and interpretive
efforts in bringing a work from
written word through musical set-
ting to performance. What a way
to begin!

Thereafter, the program inclu-
ded lecture/recitals by professional
instrumentalists (including Dr. Har-
bach herself, with a wonderful
harpsichord recital); recitals with
both performers and composers inter-
acting; and scholarly papers, of
which the most successful was
Professor Erika Metzger's on "Clara
Schumann and Her Escape From Her
Father." (Metzger is a professor

in UB's Modern Languages Department.)
And Friday's concluding session
(before the evening recital) was a
superb, beautifully constructed
paper by Dr. Edith Boroff, Professor
of Music at the State University of
New York at Binghamton, one of SUNY's
eminent Faculty Exchange Scholars.
It was she who gave the rousing
keynote speech at the aforementioned
conference at the University of
Michigan, and here she was again—
and welcome!—and her talk on "The
Apprenticeship System and the Music
of Women," even though it came

after a long hard day at 5:30 p.m.,
had all of us hanging on every word.

But I suppose the highlight of
the conference had to be the music
itself—especially in the full-
scale programs which included, on
Friday night, a recital of the
chamber music of Joan Tower, now
composer-in-residence with the
St. Louis Symphony; on Saturday
afternoon, a showcasing of the
music of Buffalo composers, Leila
Lustig and Persis Vehar; and on
Saturday night a full-scale per-
formance by the New Music Society
of Syracuse of Vivian Fine's
opera, "The Women in the Garden,"
focusing on writers Virginia Woolf,
Emily Dickinson, Gertrude Stein,
and dancer Isadora Duncan. About
this work Thomas Putnam said, "The
singing of Fine's musically deman-
ding roles was done well...The
music for the four female voices
is remarkable, a richly textured
quartet...The opera has feminist
spirit, but is amusing, not bitter
—The orchestra provides some
lightness in its jazzy, ragtime
music, and the scoring is sensitive,
often spare and carefully colored.”

It should be kept in mind that
this commentary is about music by
a contemporary composer who is a
woman. It's about time that such
non-condescending, professional
opinion is what is due for a
performance of music by women.

As Gloria Steinem said at Chau-
tauqua just a few days before the
Buffalo Women in Music Conference—
yes, we are hopeful that tomorrow,
if not sooner, women's music will
be integrated into normal concert
schedules. In the meantime, we
need—we must—continue to have
such all-women programs in order
to keep the ideas alive and to
carry the awareness forward that
for all the centuries of the male
musical mainstream, women have
been right there, thinking of,
planning, creating, writing music,
which, unfortunately, has yet to
be heard.

And, finally, there is good
news: Barbara Harbach and her
fellow musical feminists are al-
ready planning the next Women in
Music Conference to be held in
Buffalo on June 11-13, 1987.

If you missed the 1986 "do"
too bad for you. But, for the
next one, BE THERE!

The Problem is:
We Never Hear
the Music!

By now, thanks to the feminist
movement and to the impact of
Women's Studies, and to the dedi-
cation and scholarly interest of
a small, but growing, group of
women and men—information about
hundreds of women composers of
concert ("classical," "serious")
music is available. In addition,
hundreds of works in every musical
genre and for virtually every com-
bination of performance media—
all by women—are available to
be played.

THE PROBLEM, THOUGH, IS:

WE NEVER HEAR THE MUSIC!
Suggestions for remedying the
situation were the theme of Joanne
Schweik's paper "A MODEST PROPOSAL:
TOWARD MAINSTREAMING WOMEN'S MUSIC,"
given at the Friday session of the

Women in Music Symposium at the
State University College at Buffalo
on July 11-13.

Taking nearly all branches of
the concert music scene to task
for prolonging—for too long—
the absence of music by women from
performance in concert programs,
on radio, and on disks, Schweik
had specific suggestions for ways
in which all participants could
begin to make things better. Among
them:

1. It is time for affirmative
action in music. As in all areas
of the current scene, affirmative
action will probably have to be
fought for—to the greatest extent
—by women themselves.

2. Everyone who has any opportunity
or occasion to program works by
women composers should begin to do
so. If ONE WORK by a woman were
included on every program from now
on, in no time at all we would

know as many works written in a
feminine hand as those we now know
from the masculine pen; we would
have learned to love a whole new
repertoire; and recitalists, major
symphony orchestras, opera companies,
recording companies, music publishers,
etc., would begin to realize that
there is money to be made from
women's music after all.

3. All of us who are music consu-
mers (concert-goers, record-buyers,
listeners to and supporters of
concert music stations) should
begin to demand works by women

on the programs we support.

4. There should be a majestic
increase in writing grants,
proposals and other fundraising
efforts for programming women's
music. However, all such efforts
for programming should take care

to be professional, using exper-
ienced and professional researchers,
writers, performers, fundraisers
and leave behind forever the—
"Little-girl-playing-at-the-big-
time" attitudes and amateurish
methods that have characterized
