Passing a July afternoon sipping  
comfrey punch in a garden of simples  
(simple common herbs), or snipping  
genially in a plain old yarbpatch  
(small herb garden by the back door),  
is an ancient practice. It is pos-  
sible because—where the contemp-  
orary vegetable garden peevishly  
demands daily attention and, when  
ignored, retaliates with cabbage  
moths, weeds and drooping foliage—  
the garden of herbs does not.

Herbs thrive on neglect, require  
fertilizer, bask in blazing sun and  
confusion, and ask mainly not to  
stand in water. They naturally  
repel those insects like flies of  
which they are not fond, and en-  
courage those, such as bees, of  
which they are very fond. Wild  
ginger and sweet woodruff cozy up to  
tree roots where little else will  
grow. Woolly thyme bursts into a  
deliciously clean scent underfoot;  
and apple-fragrant chamomile seems  
to enjoy being sat upon.

Around March 17, curly parsley  
will appreciate a sowing by the  
light of a full and rising moon,  
but wild parsley is always self-  
sowing. Garlic will sprout from  
the grocery store variety. Mint  
of any variety grows, and grows,  
and grows. If you have it, don't  
plan not to: it's there to stay.  
And, if you plan to tap dill seed  
into the earth at ten-day intervals  
throughout July, be ready to put up  
a gallon of pickles in the fall.

An investment in hybrids and ever-  
bearing plants pales in significance  
alongside the original kitchen gar-  
den, which preceded Western know-  
ledge of and access to the vege-  
tables frantically cultivated today.  
We apparently lost all early written  
materials on herbs in the Western  
world around 1044, so we cannot re-  
construct with accuracy the contents  
of traditional “wyrtzerd," as herb  
gardens were known. Note that we  
have not lost the herbs!

We did, however, lose many of  
the women who grew them, because  
they were condemned as witches.

What knowledge we have of their gar-  
dens comes often from tracts desig-  
ned to aid in the identification  
and persecution of witches. Most  
surely those women grew mandrakes  
which are poisonous; gillyflowers,  
which today we know as carnations;  
leeks—never make potato soup with-  
out them; mallows, once common in  
salads and cooking pots; southern-  
wood, the original sleepytime tea  
and also moth repellent; bergamot  
with its historically prized citrus-  
like scent; hyssop for salads, pot-  
tage, cordials and the common cold;  
rue, in large doses poisonous but in  
small, used medicinally and as a  
potherb; sorrel, a whole salad in  
itself; dock which is not unlike  
rhubarb; and many others.

Herbs survived, in part because  
monks took them over, in part be-  
cause “humble” people relied on them  
for nutritional/medicinal sustenance,  
and in part because herbs came to be  
known as weeds—dock is only one  
example—and were left to go their  
own way. Besides, few wished to  
confront a hedge of briars. Herbs  
relish growing in the space enclosed  
by such a hedge, or by one of elder  
trees. Elder mother is even named  
as the protectress of herbs. Al-  
though nonherbaceous, she and briar  
are both considered herbs. Briar  
produced berries and, because she  
provided and guarded sustenance,  
came to be known as a friend of  
the poor.

Do celandine and dandelion—  
which many today call weeds—grow  
within briar’s and elder's embrace?  
Of course they do. They belong  
there. No sensible herbalist would  
dream of rooting them out, if only  
because celandine would produce a

rash upon her hand for doing so.  
Washing with chamomile tea will make  
it better.) And, dandelion is a  
“Good Herb," as good as lemon thyme,  
which is very good indeed—try a  
dandelion salad when the forest  
green leaves are new, and see.

Had we still available those lost  
manuscripts, we would doubtless find  
in them runes (charms) and rites  
connected holistically with live  
plants and trees, the sun, the moon,  
and the stars—matters today con-  
signed to superstition but once  
integral to sowing, setting and  
picking herbs. In the mechanistic  
universe of Newton, we came to con-  
sider the influence of heavenly  
bodies upon all earthly things; in  
the Book of Genesis, that order is  
reversed, with plants preceding  
planets and stars. This fascination  
with orderliness and influence  
escapes herbs, and it may be just  
as well. For had they proved tame,  
a good draught of comfrey punch  
today might be hard to come by.*

*Comfrey punch requires only a base  
of orange and pineapple juices, and  
perhaps a little lemon. Freshest  
is nicest. The milky green leaves  
of comfrey—also called salsify—  
are washed and any stalks (petiole)  
removed as far up the leaves as  
possible. Mince the leaves, mix  
with the fruit juices, and chill.  
Comfrey has a pleasant teaberry-like  
taste, but like atropine, it may  
increase your heartbeat. Try a  
little at a time until you are cer-  
tain it agrees with you, and you  

agree with it.

SIMPLE GIFTS

SHELTER

Simple Gifts Shelter for Women  
had their annual run in Delaware  
Park June 11, to raise funds for  
the shelter and generate public  
interest in the plight of battered  
and homeless women. Approximately  
50 women and children ran, walked  
or were pushed in a wheelchair  
around the track. Sponsors pledged  
money for each lap run in this  
AAU sanctioned race, to benefit  
Simple Gifts.

This year's run netted about  
$1,000—only two thirds as much  
as the 1982 run. Fundraisers  
such as this and individual do-  
nations are the major source of  
funds for this community supported  
shelter.

Ellen Dayton, a coordinator  
of Simple Gifts, expressed her  
gratitude to the runners and  
sponsors who cared enough, and took  
the time to do something positive  
for the women's community.

Simple Gifts Shelter, which  
recently moved to a new location,  
provides shelter and assistance to  
women and children who are leaving  
abusive situations or are homeless  
and have nowhere else to go.

EMMA IS...

EMMA is a small business, and  
like so many in these times, we are  
concerned with our survival. Despite  
the fact that we are run by volunteer  
labor, our costs are still in the  
neighborhood of $500 per week. Our  
sales have currently been averaging  
$200 per week. No one is making a  
profit, we are not actually trying to—  
we are only concerned that women  
have a place where books and other  
resources of concern to them are  
made available at a reasonable cost.  
But to do this, we need the contin-  
ued support of the women in this  
area. Put us on your summer shopping  
list, tell your friends, or call the  
store and see how you might help!

We will be sponsoring a variety of  
fundraisers during the next few  
months, and we urge you to give us  
your support in any way possible.

One enjoyable way is to join us at  
the EMMA Garage Sale! We'll be at  
172 Ashland, Buffalo, from 11-7 on  
July 30 and 31. Bargains are avail-  
able on such items as a color TV  
and mimeograph equipment. Do you  
have things to donate? Please call  
the store at 685-2285, so we can  
make arrangements.

EMMA is also starting the summer  
off with some new ideas! Have you  
ever thought of joining the EMMA  
collective, but felt that you don't  
have enough time? Are you interested  
in helping EMMA, but don't want to  
make a commitment to regular staff-  
ing and meetings? Or perhaps you  
want to contribute in a specialized  
area such as bookkeeping, public  
relations, or doing mailing and  
contacting other groups and organi-  
zations...now is the time to contact  
us! Beginning this month, there  
will be many more ways to help EMMA  
besides making a full-time membership  
commitment. If you're interested  
in staffing the store once in a  
while, contributing your special  
expertise or ideas, making a window  

display or taking EMMA materials to  
sell at community events and meetings,  
we need your help.

A potluck dinner will be held on  
July 24 at 6 p.m. for women who are  
interested in helping EMMA in any  
way. Later in the month a training  
session will also be held, depending  
on the participants' needs. We'll  
talk about what we need and what  
you might like to offer—if you're  
interested, please call the store  
at 885-2285.

A reminder—EMMA is not just a  
storefront. She travels, too! We  
are always interested in bringing  
books, periodicals and other items  
you may be interested in to commun-  
ity events and meetings. If you  
would like us to join your group  
for a special event, please call the  
store.

We will also be featuring a  
variety of in-store specials on  
books, records and crafts throughout  
the summer. Different sales will  
be posted regularly—so come in and  
check us out, and perhaps there will  
be a discount on just the item you  
were looking for!

EMMA, the Buffalo Women's Bookstore,  
is run by a volunteer collective of  
women. We are located at 168 Elm-  
wood Ave., and our hours are Monday  
through Friday, 11 A.M. to 7 P.M.,  
and Saturdays from 12 to 5.

DER-STORIES

by Cherin Silverstein

Women's lives have often gone un-  
recorded, obscured behind the accom-  
plishments of husbands, brothers and  
fathers. Generations of daughters  
have lost the opportunity to learn  
and gain courage from the lives of  
their predecessors. We offer Her-  
Stories in an effort to recover infor-  
mation about those who have gone before  
us. The women of Her-Stories are all  
connected to Western New York.

LOUISE BLANCHARD BETHUNE

“Equal pay for equal services” was  
the reason that, in 1691, Louise  
Blanchard Bethune refused to submit a  
design for the proposed Women's Build-  
ing at the World's Columbian Exposi-  
tion. The prize being offered to the  
woman of the winning design was less  
than half that being offered to men  
for similar designs. The competition  
was subsequently won by Sophia G.  
Hayden (1868-1953).

Louise Blanchard Bethune was the  
first professional American woman  
architect. Born in Waterloo, New  
York on July 21, 1856, Louise was the  
only daughter of Emma Melon (Williams)  
and Wallace Blanchard. Her only bro-  
ther died at a very early age, leaving  
Louise an only child.

Education for Louise began at home  
and continued with her enrollment in  
Buffalo High School. Following her  
graduation in 1874, she traveled and  
taught for two years in preparation  

for an architectural course she wanted  
to take at Cornell University. Louise  
decided not to attend Cornell when Buf-  
falo architect Richard Waite offered  
her a position as draftsman.

It was while working for Waite that  
Louise met her husband-to-be, Robert  
Armour Bethune. In October, 1881,  

Louise and Robert opened their own  
architectural office in Buffalo. They  
were married on December 10, 1881, and  
their only son was born in 1883.

Louise's firm designed everything  
from banks to apartment houses, resi-  
dences, schools and hotels. Her  
specialty was schools; she designed  
eighteen in Western New York.

In 1886 she inaugurated the Buffalo  
Society of Architects from which the  
Western New York Association grew.

On April 4, 1888, Louise became the  
first woman member of the American  
Institute of Architects where she  
advocated equal pay for equal service,  
a principle she held essential for  
“women's complete emancipation."

In 1898, Louise's firm was asked  
to plan the 225-room Hotel Lafayette  
which still stands in downtown Buffalo.  
The hotel was completed in 1904 in  
French Renaissance style. Her firm  
also designed the Denton, Cottier and  
Daniel's Music Store.

Louise Blanchard Bethune believed  
that women who are pioneers in any  
profession should be proficient in  
every department (for example, know-  
ing designs as well as construction)  
and know all aspects of their work.

On December 18, 1913, Louise Blan-  
chard Bethune, an Episcopalian, died  
of kidney trouble. She is buried in  
Buffalo at Forest Lawn Cemetery.

currently majoring in Humanities/  
Writing at Medaille College, Buffalo.  
She was formerly a writer for Burge  
Publishing where she compiled hist-  
orical research. Her poetry has ap-  
peared in Prelude and the American  
Anthology of Poetry.
