FRIEDAN SPEAKS AT RALLY:  
FEMINIST FOR MONDALE  

"I trust women. I trust that when  
they walk into the voting booth, they  
will vote for the deepest spiritual  
values."  

To Betty Friedan, speaking at a  
political rally in Buffalo on April  
1, a vote for "the deepest spiritual  
values" would translate into a vote  
for Fritz Mondale in the Democratic  
primaries.  

Ms. Friedan, who is widely recognized  
as the “Spiritual Mother of the  
Feminist Movement", outlined to  
the crowd assembled in the Tralfamador  
Cafe the reasons why she was  
supporting Mondale and not Gary Hart.  

Mondale, she said, has a superb  
record when it comes to women's  
rights legislation. During his 12  
years in the Senate, he was not only  
one of the chief sponsors of the Head  
Start Program, but he also developed  
the best Child-care legislation to  
date. Under his leadership, this  
legislation passed both the House and  
the Senate and would have become law  
had it not been vetoed by Nixon.  

He initiated the WIC Program  
which provided food and nutritional  
supplements to children and nursing  
mothers, until Reagan began dismantling  
it.  

Mondale also sponsored the WEEA,  
the Women's Education Equity Act,  
which provided loans and grants to  
women which enabled them to pursue  
professional studies.  

He was instrumental "beyond the  
call of duty", in getting the time  
limit extended for the passage of  
the Equal Rights Amendment and he  
has also been a strong supporter of  
the Nuclear Freeze.  

Ms. Friedan stressed the need to  
elect a Democratic candidate strong  
enough to defeat Ronald Reagan in  
November. And no candidate, she said,  
will have that strength unless he has  
the support of four blocks of voters;  
working people, old people, Blacks  
and women.  

Gary Hart, Ms. Friedan insisted,  
does not have that support, and  
instead of seeking it, has alienated  
these blocks of voters by referring  
to them as special interest groups.  
The only real special interest groups  
in this campaign, she said, are  
Reagan and business.  

More than once, Friedan characterized  
Hart as a “heartless man" who  
would do well to "put the 'e' back in  
his name." A study of Hart's legislative  
record, she said, reveals  
that he voted against the passage of  

press conference  

bills upholding strong health and  
safety standards; voted against an  
extension of unemployment benefits;  
voted to gut the minimum wage; walked  
out on an important vote on child-  
care legislation; and is in favor of  
restructuring entitlement programs,  
including Social Security. In other  
words, she said, "Hart is nothing but  
a clone of Reagan in a blow hair cut."  

"His main concern is with high  
technology weapons. Don't forget,"  
she said, "that Mussolini got the  
trains running on time."  

Further, she continued, Hart has  
not sponsored a single piece of  
feminist legislation. He does not  
believe in the Federal funding of  
abortions and he has contradicted  
himself on the ERA. Hart has shown  
no concern for the needs and problems  
of working women.  

Women now earn 59 cents for every  
dollar earned by a man. How, then,  
Ms. Friedan asked, can a woman support  
a candidate who is not in favor of  
strong unions?  

Women in this election, she asserted,  
wield a power they never had  
before. In 1984, there will be from  
6 to 8 million more women than men  
eligible to vote. The gender gap is  
real. "And I trust," she said, "that  
women will use this power to elect  
a president who will protect human  
rights."  

She passed off as ridiculous the  
claim voiced by the media that women  
will vote for Hart because he makes  
such a good sex object, that they  
will choose "blow dry over Brylcreem".  
Maybe in 1960, but in 1984?  
Women have come too far in the past  
20 years, she said, to be swayed by  
such superficial concerns. The  
reality is that “women must and will  
vote as if their lives, and the lives

of their children, depend on it,  
because they might."  

Ms. Friedan was sponsored by  
Buffalo N.O.W. as part of the effort  
of Feminists for Mondale. There was  
strong representation at the rally  
by a variety of union groups as well  
as feminist organizations. The event  
was coordinated by Feminists for  
Mondale, as well as other feminist  
organizations. It was moderated by  
Hope Hoetzer, Vice-President of the  
Buffalo Chapter of N.O.W., with  
publicity handled by Gerri Bayer.
