DIVORCE/SUPPORT CHANGES

Two separate pieces of legisla-
tion in New York State will posi-
tively affect divorces women's
financial security.

The first is a bill which man-
dates residents who are making child
support payments report changes in
employment status, including raises.
This will make it easier for those
receiving payments to ask for an
increase and harder for those pay-
ing them to duck responsibility.

The second package of legislation,
sponsored by Assemblywoman May New-
berger, D-Great Neck, seeks to
smooth out snags in New York State's
1980 Equitable Divorce Distribution
Laws. (See CG Feb. 1983.)

Currently in N.Y.S., even though
in theory assets from a marriage
are to be split equally, homemakers
on the average are getting less
than 30% of the marriage property.

The new legislation would specify
the following: that property be
split 50-50 unless the court could
show cause why another division
was made; that the homemaker's
married standard of living be taken
into consideration when making ali-
mony awards; that the court recog-
nize the value of homemaker contri-
butions to the employed spouse's
career advancement and accumulated
assets; and that a spouse cannot
transfer money or property to his or
her own name within three years of
filing for separation or divorce in
order to avoid having these assets
considered joint property.

These bills have been favorably
received by the Assembly's Judiciary
Committee and the Western New York
Women's Bar Association has unani-
mously recommended passage.

The new laws would give judges
better guidelines for property dis-
tribution in divorce cases, and
should help make the Equitable Dis-
tribution Laws more effective...

"VYOT" ALERT

Office workers and those who
have home word processors/computers
which use Video Display Terminals
(VDTs) are being addressed by a
nationwide informational campaign
conducted by 9-to-5 National Asso-
ciation of Working Women. The
safety of the low-level radiation
emitted by the VDTs has been called
into question because of the in-
crease in miscarriages and birth
defects among VDT operators in the
U.S. and Canada. Also noted by VDT
operators are vision problems, head-
aches, muscle weakness, skin rashes,
and other stress-related symptoms.

The green on green or black and
white video screen emits low-level
radiation. Radiation can also leak
out other areas of the terminals.
Eye strain is also a potential
hazard. It is recommended that a
VDT operator have an ophthalmological
exam, including a “slit lamp biomi-
croscopy" for cataract development
before beginning work on a VDT, and
yearly thereafter. [See CG Sept. '83]

9-to-5, according to a UPI article,
is proposing a "bill of rights" for
safe use of VDTs. Included are the
right to be transferred away from
VDTs during pregnancy, no more than
4 continuous hours of VDT use per
day, adjustable screens, keyboards
and glare-resistant screens to make
VDT use more comfortable and less
stressful, and monitoring and
maintenance of VDTs to limit the
level of radiation emitted by them.

Through the efforts of 9-to-5,
the National Institute of Occupa-
tional Safety and Health is conduc-
ting a two-year comparison study of
VDT users vs. non-users. They hope
to establish whether or not VDT
use is related to health risks and
health problems in the workplace.

DOLLARS TO FIGHT DOMESTIC VIOLENCE

In an effort to financially sup-
port shelters for battered women and
children, as well as fund other pro-
grams which give assistance to them,
the New York State Assembly has ap-
proved a bill adding $20 to the cost
of a marriage license fee and $2 to
birth certificate copies. The
fund, like those in eight other
states, would be used to award grants
to domestic violence programs a-
round the state, specifying that
under-served and poor areas get
first priority for funding.

According to bill sponsor William
B. Hoyt (D-Buffalo), as reported in
the Buffalo News, there were
120,000 reported cases of child
abuse alone, in New York last year.
It is hoped that as much as $4 mil-
lion can be raised to fund anti-
violence programs. Many such pro-
grams are struggling with lack of
funding, and rural areas especially
are either poorly served or served
not at all.

The surcharge on licenses and
birth certificates is a unique
way of drawing public attention to
the problem of domestic violence,
and of raising funds without using
general state revenue from taxes.

In addition, another bill spon-
sored by Hoyt has been signed into
law by Governor Mario Cuomo.

The new law is designed to pro-
tect abused children by giving
social service agencies enough time
to appeal a court order to send a
child back to a potentially danger-
ous home.

It imposes an automatic stay—
until 5 p.m. of the next business
day—of the court order to return a
child to parental custody. The
stay can be waived at any time if
all parties agree.

This legislation was necessary
because there have been a number of
cases in which child care agencies
have been unable to appeal the court
order returning a child home, because
cases were heard too late in the day.

Governor Cuomo has also recently
created a 20-member Commission
on Domestic Violence to make recom-
mendations for action on the problem.

According to sociologist Murray
Straus, "the family’s the most
physically violent group or insti-
tution except for the police, or the
military during a war." In a USA
Today article, Straus gave some of
the reasons, in his opinion, for
violence in American families.
Among them: the use of physical
punishment on children, which con-
ditions them to see violence as an
acceptable remedy to problems; male-
dominated traditional families where
family power resides in only the man;
and alcohol abuse. He also saw our
society's tolerance for violence
as perpetuating it.

Citing statistics on violence
in families, the California Commission
on Crime Control and Violence gave
persuasive reasons for increased
funding of shelters and programs.
They said nearly half of all American
women will be battered sometime in
their lives, and that at least half
of all marriages are involved in
some domestic violence.

Abortion will be against the law unless you

The choice must be

June 16 and 17, Judge John T.
Curtin heard testimony on the con-
troversy surrounding bus card ad-
vertisements which CARASA (Coalition
for Abortion Rights and Against
Sterilization Abuse) want to place
on NFTA buses. The NFTA is refusing
placement on the grounds that buses
are not public forums and that the
company has a policy of not getting
involved in controversial or po-
litical issues. Judge Curtin is
expected to give his decision within
the next several weeks. This case
is being closely watched by other
communities nationwide, because it
is the first time a dispute between
a transportation company and a
pro-choice group has gone to court.

CARASA applied for and received
a nearly $4,000 grant from the Ms.
Foundation to run this bus card
campaign. The campaign, modeled
after one developed by the Repro-
ductive Rights National Network
(R2N2) and conducted in San Fran-
cisco, places bus cards on selected
routes, displaying a message and
phone number where people can call
for more information.

CARASA hopes to organize vol-
unteers and a telephone answering
machine which would give callers
legislative information and/or
information about women's rights
under the law.

The bus campaign is designed to
raise public awareness about re-
productive choices, and uses buses
because of the large number of women
riders. Buses reach many who do
not have ready access to abortion
information, and who may, because
of their economic status, lose
access to abortion if the right to
choose became restricted.

This type of campaign ran success-
fully in San Francisco and Hartford,
Conn., and in two other cities,
Boston and Philadelphia, the trans-
portation company backed down and
ran the cards when it became obvious
it would end up in litigation. No
other company (besides NFTA) has re-
fused to settle out of court. One
CARASA spokesperson speculated that
the NFTA wants to be court-ordered
to run the cards, because they can
then disclaim responsibility for
running the ads.

CARASA originally contacted NFTA
in April 1982 about their ad, and
was put in touch with an ad agency
which sells that bus space. The
agency said there would be no
problem placing the bus cards, which
were described to the agency.
Spokeswoman Janet Packard said, "we
decided on 250-300 buses and chose
the routes. We got information on
public service ad rates. The only
thing left to do was get the ad
printed." At that point, everything
with the campaign was "go."

After a Pat Swift Womanscope co-
column in the Buffalo News noted
the upcoming bus card campaign, the
ad agency called CARASA back, and
informed them that the ad needed
to be "approved" by the NFTA. The
NFTA refused to run them. J.M. Heinen,
speaking for NFTA said the bus com-
pany has a policy of not becoming
involved in controversial issues.

When arguing against bus card
placement, NFTA lawyers asserted
that the cards are a political
message asking people to act or
lobby against anti-abortion legis-
lation. In a related development,
the local Right-to-Life Committee,
which opposes bus card placement,
says it will demand “equal time”
placement of its bus card, featuring
aborted fetuses, alongside CARASA's
cards, if Judge Curtin rules in
CARASA's favor. NFTA lawyers are
using this development to underscore
their position for not running
CARASA's ad. Judge Curtin, however,
wouldn't let NFTA introduce this
information to the case, calling
it irrelevant to the matter at hand.

According to Janet Packard,
CARASA's position is that the buses
are a public forum. NFTA has run
other bus card ads informing people
of their rights under the law, on
such issues as fair housing and
food stamps. They have also run
cards on such controversial issues
as smoking and liquor advertisement,
and even a bus card from Planned
Parenthood. Abortion is legal,
stressed Packard, and therefore
although controversial to some, it
should fall within the same guide-
lines as other ads.

"CARASA will introduce testimony
that the NFTA does not usually re-
view ads, and that this action was
taken in light of the Womanscope
article, and that CARASA is being
discriminated against because NFTA
doesn't like the issue of abortion,"
said Packard. In CARASA's view,
as a public forum, NFTA violates
their First Amendment rights of
freedom of speech by refusing to
run the ads.

Judge Curtin tried to get
NFTA and CARASA to settle, after
hearing arguments for a preliminary
injunction against the bus company.
When no settlement was reached,
Curtin converted the injunction into
a permanent injunction and accepted
testimony in the case.

CARASA has asked for attorney
fees, court costs and $50,000
punitive damages from NFTA, as well
as $100 per day for each day the
card placement is delayed. The
Ms. Foundation has said the grant
money may not be used for the
court case, and would have to be
turned back if CARASA lost.

Packard said CARASA would definitely
appeal if NFTA won. She
also said that NFTA could set up
their ad policy prohibiting all but
commercial advertisement, but that
as it stands now, they cannot
exclude one or some issues, without
excluding all public service/infor-
mation ads.

Currently, Judge Curtin has
given both sides until June 28 to
submit written statements of facts.
After that time, he will set a date
for oral arguments.
