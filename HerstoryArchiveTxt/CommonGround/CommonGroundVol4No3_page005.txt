WITCH HUNT - 1985

"Witchcraft as a religion may not have  
a universal creed or set liturgy; but  
on some points there is unanimity. No  
true Witches today practice human  
sacrifice, torture or any form of  
ritual murder. Anyone who does is  
not a witch, but a psychopath" (Star-  
hawk).

"Satanism today is quite different  
from historical Witchcraft...and it  
(Satanism) is totally rejected by all  
the neopagan Witches today" (Russell).

There is a new, and very real,  
Witch hunt gathering momentum. Before  
you say to yourself, “I'm not a Witch,  
what do I care?" wait a minute.  
Remember that wonderful statement  
from German Pastor Martin Niemoeller  
after World War II. "First, the  
Nazis went after the Jews, but I  
wasn't a Jew so I didn’t react. Then  
they went after the Communists, but I  
wasn't a Communist so I didn't object.  
Then they went after the Catholics,  
but I wasn't a Catholic so I didn't  
stand up. Then they went after the  
Protestant clergy and by that time it  
was too late for anybody to stand up."  
Or, think about how often we make  
comments to the effect that “until  
everyone is free, no one is free."  
Moves are being made against your  
Wiccan and Pagan sisters and brothers.  
These efforts, which directly and  
immediately threaten the religious  
freedom of some of us, undermine the  
religious freedom of all of us.

**Jesse Helms managed to get the  
following Amendment 705 attached  
to HR3036 (the Treasury, Postal  
Service, and General Government  
Appropriations Bill for 1986):  
“No funds appropriated under this  
act shall be used to grant,  
maintain, or allow tax exemption  
to any cult, organization, or  
other group that has as a purpose  
or that has any interest in the  
promoting of satanism or witch-  
craft: provided that for purposes  
of this section, "satanism" is  
defined as the worship of Satan  
or the powers of evil and "witch-  
craft" is defined as the use of...  
spirits, the use of sorcery, or  
the use of supernatural powers  
with malicious intent."

**Robert Walker (Rep., Pa) has  
introduced a separate bill,  
HR3389, which is essentially  
the same as Helms’ Amendment  
705.

**ABC-TV "20/20", a widely watched  
program, did a segment on Satan-  
ism and cult murders.

A talk this summer by Nancy Bereano,  
owner of Firebrand Books, got me so  
excited that I bought five copies of  
Mohawk Trail -- one for me, four for  
friends. So I'm not exactly objective  
about it. But why should I be?  
Bereano's talk raised my conscious-  
ness about the whole publishing  
picture. Words on paper don't exist  
in a vacuum. They're only one part  
of a whole system that includes not  
only ideas but also actions, travel,  
and transfers of money, paper, and  
ink. It's all these things and more,  
not the author's words alone, that  
add up to the thing we call "a book."

I've always been a book buyer, but  
until this summer, I've bought them  
without thinking about who was get-  
ting my money or what would be done  
with it. If the publisher was  
Spinsters Ink or Seal Press, fine;  
but if not, I still bought the book.  
Sometimes I didn't even look to see  
who the publisher was.

I do now. I compare this raising  
of consciousness with my awakening  
to feminism 10 years ago, and later,  
with the bombshell of awareness of  
racism. Once it was pointed out to  
me, I saw how U.S. publishing offers  
a forum to some voices -- but  
silences others. Like other women,  
I'm continuing to wake up to hitherto  
unheard voices, as more women find  
courage -- and a forum -- to speak.

I can’t count the times I've read  
a book because I've heard good  
things about it...or, more to the  
point, the times I've passed up a  
book because I haven't heard it  
discussed. I never realized how  
much I was influenced by the publish-  
ing establishment. How do "good  
things" get “heard” about a book?  
Reviews. Advertisements. Word of  
mouth. The reputation of the writer.  
The writer's credentials -- other  
publications, academic position and  
honors, grants, fellowships, prizes.  
Praise by other writers with similar  
credentials.

All this adds up to validation by  
the system. And even if the system  
is women's publishing or the alter-  
native press, the network is not  
going to "say good things" about the  
work of women outside it. Unpalat-  
able voices get shoved to the bottom  
of the pile, especially when plenty  
of women are writing in familiar  
modes -- the academic mode, the  
feminist-theory mode, the lesbian-  
novel mode, and groundbreaking-  
anthology mode, and others.

It's hard to hear new kinds of  
voices. It takes effort to get into  
a story told in an unfamiliar way,  
about kinds of people who are not  
"us," especially when we haven't  
read a review or seen an ad assuring  
us that it’s worth the effort. People  
who write book reviews tend to be  
college products, and college-goers  
tend to be disproportionately white  
and at least middle-class. This kind  
of shaping of opinion is similar to  
the de facto censorship of news by,  
for instance, the New York Times,  
whose reporters are overwhelmingly  
male, and if female, overwhelmingly  
white, and if black or Hispanic or  
American-Asian or Indian, overwhelm-  
ingly heterosexual. They also tend  
to be thin and able-bodied. If a  
publisher lacks the cash flow to get  
a book into the literary tenure track,  
it will be neither reviewed nor dis-  

cussed nor seen in bookstores. The  
author will not be interviewed in  
Common Ground, let alone in Ms. or on  
the Phil Donahue show. For a woman  
to write about her experience is not  
enough. It's only the beginning.  
Even getting a book published is only  
the first step in a long process.

I think writers tend to feel we're  
above the business of advertising and  
distribution. “Leave that to people  
who like the business side of publish-  
ing," we say with a sneer. “Leave  
that to the accountants." There's a  
long tradition among literary writers  
(as opposed to those whose frank  
purpose is to make money) of contempt  
for the materialistic publisher. Dog-  
gone publisher, always trying to  
bring us down to earth. Doggone  
publisher, always talking about econ-  
omic viability and paying the printer's  
bill. How mundane, we think. How can  
these businesspeople dare to interfere  
with our artistic integrity?

But publishers are not a monolith,  
and they're definitely not fountains  
of money. Some small-press publishers  
even work without salary, pumping  
their own money into the venture and  
holding down other jobs. Even if the  
publisher herself works free, however,  
printers have to be paid. Printing  
equipment has to be paid for, or the  
bank will take it away. Rent and help  
must be paid. Paper and ink have to  
be paid for, or the next shipment  
won't be delivered.

And to pay the printer, the pub-  
lisher has to sell books. She can’t  
publish a book just because she likes  
it; she also has to consider whether  
she can sell enough copies to meet  
the cost of publishing. Moreover,  
there's the question of cash flow.  
To get the book on the street, the  
publisher has to shell out in advance  
and if she guesses wrong about the  
book's saleability, she'll be in  
debt.

And that publishing house -- along  
with Persephone Press, Daughters,  
Inc., and far too many others -- will  
be gone.

That's why I can't be objective  
about Mohawk Trail. If the women's  
movement is to survive, if we are to  
make a real difference in women's  
lives, Beth Brant's voice must be  
heard. Mohawk Trail is a piece of  
the whole truth. Like Audre Lorde's  
Zami and Alice Bloch's The Law of  
Return, among others, it's a view  
of life -- life as it is, but not,  
unfortunately, as most people see it.  
Not that it's a blockbuster or an  
attempt to reorder the entire uni-  
verse. As I sit here, trying to  
speak the heart's truth that will  
impel you to go out and buy it,  
the word "modest" keeps coming to  
mind. Mohawk Trail is a modest,  
unpretentious collection of stories  
that Brant needed to tell and that we  
need to hear. But somehow, in its  
very unpretentiousness, the pattern  
of the universe comes a bit clearer.
