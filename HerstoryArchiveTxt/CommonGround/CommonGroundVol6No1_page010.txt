Should Old Acquaintance Be Forgot

By Adeline Hinman

Once upon a time in a country  
to the north of Erie there lived  
a sweet young thing who was totally  
in love. She was in love with love,  
she was in love with the human race  
and, most especially, she was in  
love with a young man. Her loving  
nature gave her world a rosy cast;  
it gave her mother nightmares and  
her boyfriend high hopes. As one  
might imagine, her boyfriend's  
high hopes figured prominently in  
her mother’s nightmares. It would  
be nice if the rules found in fairy  
tales applied to real life situa-  
tions, but such is seldom the case,  
and as it turned out the young  
girl's naivete was self-defeating,  
not rewarding; her mother's scep-  
ticism was justified, not disproved;  
and Prince Charming was really a  
toad in disguise. But all that  
came much later.

At the time of which I write our  
heroine, Bedelia, had graduated  
from high school and entered the  
world of business. Prince Charming  
had also graduated but he joined  
the Navy, an act Bedelia saw as  
patriotic and noble. Mother con-  
sidered it stereotypical behavior:  
everyone knows what sailors are.

It wasn't that Mother was preju-  
diced against sailors; her brother  
was a career Navy man and her  

younger (and favorite) son was an  
ex-Navy man. But she knew all  
sailors were not like her brother  
and son, plus Prince Charming had  
earned a reputation for cheating  
on Bedelia and lying about it.  
Most mothers would agree that  
Bedelia's mother was justified in  
her distrust of Prince Charming.

Days turned into weeks, letters  
coursed back and forth between the  
lovers, and finally Prince's boot  
camp was completed. One day a  
letter came telling Bedelia 1)  
Prince would be home for the  
Christmas and New Year holidays,  

2) his sister Helga was planning  
a New Year's Eve party to which  
he and Bedelia were cordially  

invited, and 3) Prince had bought  
her Christmas gift at the PX.

Joy reigned supreme, except for  
Mother to whom the idea of Bedelia  
attending a New Year's Eve party  
with a celebrative sailor was  
cause for controlled alarm.

The holidays did arrive, as  
did the Prince carrying a large,  
gaily wrapped package for Bedelia:  
a complete assortment of Desert  
Flower toiletries, a fragrance  
Shulton had recently introduced.  
Bedelia received her gifts with  
great enthusiasm, and declared  
she would use it on New Year's  
Eve.

December 31 blew in with a  
storm that rapidly escalated into  
blizzard proportions. Bedelia's  
business office closed at noon.  
Slogging home from the bus stop  
through drifts up to her knees,  
Bedelia wondered if the party  
would be cancelled. About dinner  
time the Prince called to say the  
party was still on but in view of  
the weather she was invited to  
spend the night at Helga's home.  
True to form, Bedelia saw this  
sequence of events as a great  
adventure, while Mother viewed  
it as yet another of Prince's  
transparent schemes to get her  
daughter into the sack.

That evening the storm abated  
while Bedelia splashed happily  
in her Desert Flower bubble bath;  
afterward she liberally applied  
Desert Flower dusting powder.

Her underarms were rendered sweet  
with Desert Flower deodorant.  
And finally, she sprayed Desert  
Flower cologne on her upper torso,  
followed by half a dozen random  
squirts of Desert Flower hair  
spray. She omitted the perfume;  
that might be too much. In this  
highly aromatic state Bedelia was  
escorted to the party which was  
in full swing when she and Prince  
arrived, snowy but ready for fun.  
The party was an unqualified suc-  
cess and next morning the sun shone  
with the intensity Nature seems  
to reserve for the day following  

with his quick smile and laughing eyes?

He loves you, too, you know---  
From before the time you even were.

Be healthy and happy and grow strong my little one.  
The journey to the beginning is long yet.

severe weather. Bedelia woke up  
in her strange bed scratching her  
arms, and her face, and her neck,  
and her--you name it, it itched.  
She opened her eyes but one refused  
to open. The mirror showed why:  
her left eye was swollen shut.  
Not only that, there were long  
red welts on her face and neck,  
giving the appearance that she  
had been slapped and strangled.  
Similar red blotches covered her  
arms and legs, and on further  
examination her entire body. In  
short, she was a mess.

Helga tried her best to be  
helpful to the suffering girl but  
she was also suffering, on the  
inside. Even the plop-fizz of  
Alka Seltzer hitting water made  
her wince. Prince arrived to  
take Bedelia home. His usual good  
spirits were radically altered  
by the thought of riding public  
transportation with a young woman  
who looked like the loser in a  
Pier 6 brawl. While waiting for  
the bus, Prince attempted self-  
conscious conversation. People  
gathering at the bus stop stared  
at the curious couple and looked  
away, only to look again furtively.  
And all the while there was the  
prospect of Mother waiting, he  
was sure, like an avenging angel  
ready to do whatever it is avenging  
angels do to people who incur their  
wrath.

In years to come when Bedelia
