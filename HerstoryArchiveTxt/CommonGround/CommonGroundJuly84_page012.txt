I read THE DOLLMAKER several years  
ago at the insistence of a former  
student of mine who had read it for  
a college course. I can remember  
loving it. Loving it to the point  
of being depressed when it ended be-  
cause the characters were so real to  
me and I missed them. Loving it so  
much I bought paperback copies and  
handed them out to friends with a  
little pep talk on how much they  
would love it.  

Over the years I had forgotten  
parts of the plot, but the charac-  
ters of Gertie Nevels, her husband  
Clovis, their children, neighbors,  
teachers were still clear in my  
mind. Because of this, I was a bit  
leery of watching the televised  
version of this novel even though it  
starred the remarkable Jane Fonda  
and had a boatload of other artistic  
luminaries involved in its creation.  
I was afraid the fine characters  
wrought by Ms. Arnow would somehow  
be violated in my mind if I saw  
them played by "real" people on TV.  

But, I did watch it and although  
my feelings for the show are not as  
strongly positive as my feelings to-  
ward the book, the show was still  
powerful. Rather than being an  
ugly stepsister to the book (which  
so many movies and TV shows taken  
from books end up as) Fonda's DOLL-  

MAKER became an entity apart from its  
source. The characters, plot, themes  
and much of the dialog came directly  
from the novel, but the acting, won-  
derful screenplay and direction gave  
the show a life of its own.  

PAGE 12 COMMON GROUND JULY 1984  

For those of you unlucky enough  
not to have read the book or seen the  
show, the story follows a couple of  
years in the life of Gertie Nevels,  
wife, mother of five children, wood-  

carver, lover of animals and the land.  

Gertie and her family are from the  
backhills of Kentucky where they live  
in material poverty but where their  
sense of dignity and self-worth are  
never impugned. It is 1944 and Ger-  
tie's husband, Clovis, is the only  
younger man left in their little  
community who hasn't been taken into  
the army. Clovis, who loves machines,  
goes to Detroit to work in a defense  
plant. He sends for Gertie and the  
children and although she is reluc-  
tant to go, her mother tells her God  
will punish her if she doesn't obey  
her husband. Gertie is at first  
overwhelmed with the dirt, noise and  
lack of privacy in their squalid  
apartment near the factory. Clovis  
had quickly adopted the habit of  
buying goods on time, and Gertie, who  
had inherited a few hundred dollars  
from a beloved brother killed in the  
war, doesn't tell Clovis she has the  
money hidden in her coat lining.  
Gertie's children are told in  
school to “adjust" to city life and  
three of them do. Of the other two,  
one runs away back to Kentucky and  
one is killed by a train (one of the  
most moving moments in both the book  
and the show). Gertie's secret hoard  
of money is all spent on her dead  
child's funeral. One of Gertie's  
children's teachers admires her wood-  
carvings - a talent which she had  
never taken for more than a hobby -  
and she begins selling her work.  
When Clovis’ union goes on strike,  
Gertie is forced to cut up her prize  
piece of cherrywood on which she had  
been trying to carve a statue of  
Jesus, in order to make little dolls  
to sell. In the show she uses the  
money to get her family back to Ken-  
tucky. In the book she resigns her-  

self to scratching out a living in  
Detroit but with a renewed faith in  

herself and others. I can't decide  
which ending I like better. The  
book's is more painful, and, perhaps  
because of that, more realistic.  

Both the book and the play show  
the greed of corporate America and  
its efforts to force people to "ad-  
just" by constantly creating new con-  
sumer goods for them to purchase,  
thereby keeping them forever in debt.  
Clovis was a sucker for this way of  
life, buying Gertie all kinds of  
gadgets including a “Cold Heart" re-  
frigerator. I don't know how much  
of a symbol Ms. Arnow meant that  
hypothetical brand name to be, but  
it seems to me a description, maybe  
even an indictment, of a system which  
seeks to make machines of its popu-  
lace. At the beginning of the story,  
Gertie is asked by an army officer  
passing through her Kentucky town,  
"What do you people raise around  
here anyway?" "Young 'uns," Gertie  
snaps back, "for yer wars 'n' fac-  
tories." Gertie knows instinctively  
what's happening around her and it  
is that instinct which keeps her free  
even in the midst of Detroit's teem-  
ing machine-oriented culture.  

We can learn so much from Gertie  
about remaining human in a techno-  
logical age; of trusting who we are;  
of staying true to the land; of  
treasuring children. Both Arnow's  
Gertie and Fonda's Gertie teach us  
that, although the book doesn't have  
corporate America butting in every  
few minutes with commercials! But,  
hey, if corporate America wants to  
pay for a show which unfolds such a  
negative view of its own greed, then,  
surely, some small justice has been  

levied!  

THE DOLLMAKER is a masterpiece.  
Daniel Petrie, director of the TV  
show said that after the last scene  
was finished, Fonda "sobbed for 10  
minutes...I think it was because the  
character was dead and she was in  
mourning." But, Gertie isn't dead;  
Gertie lives, to inspire and teach.  
Read this book and see the play if  
it's televised again; you won't be  

sorry.
