Keeping Kids Fit

I've never been a great fitness  
freak, a jogger or an exercise per-  
son. For years, I never even owned  
a pair of sneakers. However, watch-  
ing how easy it is for children to  
become "couch potatoes" in front of  
the television has made me more aware  
of what I teach my two children, as  
well as the example I set for them.

A recent article in the Syracuse  
Herald American states: "Almost  
2/3 of (children) fail to meet mini-  
mum standards, according to a recent  
survey conducted by the Amateur Ath-  
letic Union." Writer Katherine Mar-  
tin also cites a two-year survey of  
kids between the ages of 10-17 done  
by the National Children and Youth  
Fitness Study, which concluded,  
“American children and adolescents  
are not developing the exercise and  
fitness skills that could help main-  
tain their good health as adults,  
and as many as half may not be get-  
ting enough exercise to develop  
healthy cardio respiratory systems."

Well, keeping kids fit is all  
easier said than done, especially  
in Buffalo's climate. When we are  
housebound for several months each  
year, active play and exercise is  
more difficult. Yet if we are con-  
cerned with our kids' fitness, we  
have to make a special effort during  
these months.

Our favorite way to exercise  
during the winter months is to go  
swimming in one of the city's indoor  
pools. Buffalo residents can get an  
I.D. for $1.00, and then swim for  
less than $1.00 each visit. Connors-  
Kait -Harrity Memorial Pool, on Abbot  
Road near Red Jacket Parkway in South  
Buffalo, is Olympic size. The depth  
of the shallow end is 3 feet, and  
there is also an upstairs observation  
deck. Call 825-1326 for open swim  
times and schedule of lessons. The  
Lovejoy Pool, in the 1100 block of  
Lovejoy Avenue, is a smaller pool  
but equally clean and warm. The  
shallow end also begins at 3 feet,  
but parents of pre-schoolers will  
be happy to note that very wide and  
long steps lead into the shallow end.

Our first visit to the Lovejoy Pool  
was the first time in over two years  
that my toddler could stand in a pool-  
by herself (and that I could swim  
a bit alone). Their phone number is  
896-9273.

Another winter option is visiting  
one of the area fast-food chains with  
an indoor play area. Of course, this  
poses a dilemma for those of us who  
restrict our kids' intake of junk  
food. However, we sometimes use these  
play areas without buying a meal, or  
only after buying orange juice. The  

following restaurants in W.N.Y. have  
indoor playgrounds:

McDonald's at the following locations:  
1. University Plaza (this one is  
our favorite, because it is  
large enough to run in, it  
is carpeted to cushion falls,  
and it is an enclosed room so  
toddlers can't stray).  
2. 5150 Sheridan Drive  
3. East Aurora  
4. Bailey and Genesee Streets (some  
equipment is outside)  
5. 262 Grider Street, Buffalo  
Burger King at these locations:  
6. 2416 Seneca Street, South Buffalo  
7. Sheridan and Mill, Williamsville  

The YWCA should not be forgotten,  
especially during the cold months.  
They offer a variety of gymnastic  
classes for children as young as 3  
years old. The Downtown YWCA also  
has a pool for use by members (adult  
membership is $15.00/year), and they  
offer year-round swim lessons (8 week  
sessions) for ages 6 months and up.  
Since there are few other fitness  
classes for toddlers, I've attended  
numerous Y swim classes with my  
little ones. Also, infant swim  
classes are a great way to get out  
of the house and meet other parents.  
Their addresses and phone numbers  
are:

-Downtown YWCA, 190 Franklin St.,  
Buffalo, 14202 (Their brochure lists  
programs for all 3 YWCA's). 852-6120.

-North YWCA, 2844 Delaware Ave., Ken-  
more, 14217. 875-3111.

-South YWCA, 22 Mesmer Ave.,  
14220... 822-1808.

Also, if your children are young,  

Buffalo,  

don't totally rule out outdoor play-  
grounds in the winter. As long as  
the ground isn't too muddy, and as  
long as you dress everyone in layers,  
you can brave the cold for an hour  
or so. Last winter, we even dis-  
covered that the swings in Chestnut  
Ridge Park stay up all winter.  
Sledding also affords considerable  
exercise, from climbing up the hill  
each time.

Spring and summer open up more  
choices for physical exercise for  
kids. When the ground is dry enough,  
playgrounds are the most obvious site  
for strenuous outside play. Area  
playgrounds are much too numerous to  
list. Instead, here are just some  
of the favorites of my children (ages  
2 and 6):

LaSalle Park (Front Park): located  
just past the new bandshell. Lots  
of new, durable equipment (including  

a roller slide) with many parts for  
climbing. Large sand area. Beware  
of swings, which are hazardously  
close to where kids walk. Proximity  
to the river is pleasant for parents.  
Also, lots of room to take a walk or  
run around.

KEEPING KIDS Fit /

located  
Also  
some new playground equipment, with  

Martin Luther King Park:  
at Fillmore and Best Street.  

picnic tables nearby. Again, lots  

of space to walk or run.

Playground adjacent to War Memorial  
Stadium: Located on Best Street.  

New equipment of both the quantity  
and quality of that at LaSalle Park.  
Has 3 slides (one is a roller slide)  
and a wonderful curved tube in which  
kids can climb. Picnic tables near-  
by. Those uncomfortable with the  
location could consider going there  
during a Bisons game, when lots of  
people and police are visible.  
Shoshone Park: Again, new and plen-  
tiful equipment, much for climbing,  
and one roller slide. Tennis courts  
and baseball diamonds require a  
groundskeeper at this park; thus I've  
found the sandboxes here to be the  
only ones in Buffalo that are regu-  
larly raked free of broken glass.  
North Tonawanda Park: located on  
Payne Ave. near Mid-City Plaza.  

Lots of equipment, but quite spread  
out. Grass underfoot. Small spray  
pool for toddlers. The larger pool  
is for No. Tonawanda residents.  

Play area next to West Seneca Library:  
located on Union Rd. between Center  
Road and Main Street. Lots of swings,  
sandbox and grass.  

Delaware Park: The playground is on  
Parkside Ave. near the Zoo. Predomi-  
nantly climbing apparatus, especially  
that large “red thing" visible from  
Parkside Avenue. Small sandbox.  
Also, consider a bike ride or walk  
around the park (about 2 miles).  
Jogging lane is wide enough for  
strollers.

Climbing, running and playground play  
are all good exercise, but don't for-  
get the most obvious: your child's  
gym class in school. Make it a point  
to find out what sorts of games and  
activities are taught in gym. Find  
out if your child participates fully  
in all activities. Also, if your  
child complains about gym class, it  
may be because the games are overly  
competitive and (s)he may not be  
winning. Unfortunately, all too  
many gym classes stress competition  
rather than health and fitness. If  
necessary, talk to your child's gym  
instructor.

Finally, monitor and, if need be,  
limit the time your child spends at  
stationary activities, such as TV  
viewing, using computers, and play-  
ing video games. And don't forget  
one of the most obvious, yet health-  
iest exercises: walking! Don't let  
your kids get too car-dependent.  
When no other fitness option seems  
available, take them for a walk. I  
do. In fact, I've just bought my  
first pair of sneakers since college.
