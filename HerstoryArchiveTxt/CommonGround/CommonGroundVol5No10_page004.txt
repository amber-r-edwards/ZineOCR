Spouse-Abuse Video

The YWCA of the Tonawandas has pro-
duced a 23-minute video to reach women
who are victims of domestic violence
with the message: “There is a way out,
it isn't your fault, you don't have to
stay because help is available.”

The video features the stories of
women who have been victims of domestic
violence. FBI statistics indicate that
a woman is beaten every 18 seconds each
day, 25% of all battered women are preg-
nant, and nearly half of all married
women have been beaten at least once by
their husbands.

The video makes a point of showing
that women who are battered are not
stereotypically poor and uneducated.
The YWCA of the Tonawandas hopes
groups will show the video to members
and that it will be accepted for te-
levision in order to reach more women
who may feel trapped and not be aware
that help is available.

Statistics show that young
women are not marrying at the
rate they once did. The marriage
rate of those 15 to 44 dropped to
99.3 per 1000 in 1983, when the
study was made by the National
Center for Health Statistics, com-
pared to 101.9 in 1982. More women
are opting for a better education and
the pursuit of a career than ever
before.

Women who decided that marriage
was not for them have for centuries
been the butt of ridicule and
intimidation. Society had decreed that
they assume a certain role in life -
to marry and have children. They were
programmed from infancy to assume
that role, from the toys they played
with to the books they read, and they
were trapped into a time frame to
accomplish that end. If they went to
college, they kept one eye open for
the books and the other for a husband.
More likely, they were told it would
be a waste of time and money to go to
college because they would marry and
wouldn't need all that education.

Girls who fell in love with
the "right one" and married early were
probably few and far between. Most
women wanted to marry sooner or later
but they were goaded by family,
friends, and relatives into believing
that with each passing year, their
chances grew slimmer. Many a mother
couldn't relax until her daughter
walked down the aisle and lent
legitimacy to what she feared was or
would soon be going on. At the root
of the anxiety, of course, was the
economic factor. With the gross
inequality in wages, women feared a
future alone and poor. [That marriage
didn't insure a comfortable life was
a fact they chose to ignore.] Too
often the young ladies jeopardized
their future happiness by compro-
mising on a less than likely prospect.

The fate of the few who chose to
remain single depended on the era in
which they lived. At one time they
could look forward to a life of ser-
vility in the home of some relative.
Even in this century, the idea of a
young lady leaving her family to get
her own apartment was frowned upon.
Eventually, she could attain a cer-
tain independence in lifestyle, but
socially, she was never quite accept-
ed into the mainstream. Indeed, she
might have had to withstand innuendos

..The President of the Communica-
tion Workers of America, Morton
Bahr, said their AT&T union mem-
bers will strike if the company
targets female employees for wage
cuts. AT&T says clerical workers
and operators are over-paid by 20-
30%. Most of these workers are
women. Bahr said this was a strike
issue because women do not earn e-
nough money even under existing pay
scales, and that the unions believed
comparable worth was the way to go.

With the Power of Each Breath: A
Disabled Women’s Anthology Wins
President's Committee Award

With the Power of Each Breath has
received the President’s Committee
on Employment of the Handicapped 1986
Book Award, given to works which “im-
prove the image of people with disa-
bilities and increase general know-
ledge in the field of disability.”

Susan Browne, Debra Connors, and
Nanci Stern, who are active in both
the disability rights and women's
movements, will receive the Presi-
dent's Committee Award, which is
juried by working librarians, on May
1st in Washington D.C. Notice of
the award will be sent to 10,000 li-
braries in the U.S. this Summer.

With the Power of Each Breath: A
Women's Anthology is the
to comprehensively docu-
ment the lives of disabled women.
Representing the contributions of
over 50 disabled women, the book is
an essential tool for examining and
challenging ableism in both the
mainstream and the women's movement.

as to the very purpose of her exist-
ence.

In a 1983 study by Arland Thorn-
ton and Deborah Freedman of the
University of Michigan, titled "The
Changing American Family", they state:
“The legitimacy of remaining single is
increasingly accepted by both young
people and their parents; Americans
no longer regard getting married as
necessarily better than remaining
single."

This is surely a step in the
right direction when women can exer-
cise their choice of lifestyle with-
out suffering society's ill will.

Sexism is woven into our language
like old signs for smallpox. Single
women have especially borne the brunt
of its foolishness. Has anyone ever
heard of an "old bachelor" - at age
28? “Old maid" was a term of such
opprobrium, they even made it the
name of a game, and you know which
card no one wanted! The more genteel
might use the term “maiden lady" or
“spinster” - it gives me visions of
bobbins spinning about in a laborious
cottage industry. Then there evolved
"bachelor girl" with all its racy
connotations. Fortunately, these words
are no longer in common use. The
all-encompassing “singles” confronts
us at every turn today - bars, clubs,
cruises, you name it. Since singles
have become so numerous and such a
lucrative consumer group, the divis-
ions among never married, divorced,
and widowed have blurred.

A man is a "Mr." all of his life
after he graduates from the ridicu-
lous boyhood title of "Master" with
its not so subtle intimations of
power. Women, however, have been
cast into two categories - the wed
and the unwed. With the women's
movement came "Ms." It is more
commonly accepted by the media than
in business or social contacts, and
is mostly shunned by married women.
Perhaps the term itself is at fault.
“Mz." has a fuzzy ring to it, not
clear and crisp like "Mister".

A slip of the tongue and it comes
out as "Miss", so we are back to
square one. With so many married
women retaining their maiden names
or hyphenating the names, indeed
with so many of them becoming
unmarried, we should probably
establish a suitable title to
include all women, just as all
men are designated.

..Babies of women who work during
pregnancy show no significant differ-

be done several weeks earlier than

-Is P.M.S. -pre-menstrual syndrome-
really a disease? Some women psychi-

be included in the standard reference
book Diagnostic and Statistical Manual
(DSM-III). According to one physician,
it only fuels the notion that women
are helpless victims of their hormones.
Research on PMS has been criticized as
sloppy and incomplete. On the other
hand, some doctors think it is a le-
gitimate diagnosis and prevents women
from being misdiagnosed as having
schizophrenic or other disorders,
steering instead doctors to appropriate
treatment...

Judy Woodruff, currently Chief
Washington Correspondent on MacNeil/
Lehrer News Hour, and anchor of
NBC's “Frontline,” spoke in Buffalo
recently about the barriers against
women in the TV media: “The age
issue may be the final litmus test
of our acceptability. We will find
out if we were hired because we
were pretty and young. If we were,
we're going to be put out to pasture
once the wrinkles start showing.”

Dear Common Ground:

A STRANGE ENCOUNTER

It happened to me in Buffalo
a few years ago; and the memory is
still fresh as yesterday. It can be
conjured up out of the recesses
of my mind in an instant... some-
times when I see a headline in the
news announcing yet another rapist
attack. Walking certainly can be
dangerous for a lone woman.

Well before that singular
experience, my husband had been
clipping articles about attacks on
women - jogging or just walking
home - and leaving them for me to
read. This message was reinforced by
verbal warnings every time he saw
me headed for an early morning or
late evening walk.

However, having taken pleasure
in walking anywhere I chose from
childhood on, and having felt
comfortable walking alone in crowded
cities, anywhere in the world, as
well as in the solitude of a
quiet countryside, I wasn’t about to
stop walking now.

That incident, though, was the
first time I'd been scared - really
scared - and I came home shaking.
After all, the headline in that even-
ing's paper could have read BUFFALO
WOMAN ATTACKED NEAR
COLLEGE. My husband might have come
to get me [at the Police Station,
or the Hospital?]...and his first
words certainly would have been, “I
told you so." Would the penalty
paid be worth the pleasure?

In recent years, I’d discovered
that taking a brisk 15-20 minute
morning walk, first thing, even be-
fore breakfast, was the very best way

"Single women over 35 have a 5%
chance of getting married; for those
over 40, the odds drop to 1%. So says
a study commissioned not by the Na-
tional Enquirer, but by Harvard and
Yale Universities.

People magazine reinforces the
stereotypical image of spinster and
gives credibility to this study with
their March 31 cover entitled “Are
These Old Maids?" referring to unwed
female celebrities over 30. Scattered
throughout the article are drawings of
tight-mouthed, gray-haired women
with reading glasses from the “Old
Maid" card game.

49-year-old Rose Bird, Chief
Justice of the California Supreme
Court, is given a 0.1% chance to
walk down the aisle. Her outstand-
ing accomplishments are eclipsed by
this ridiculous survey which, in ef-
fect, states that marriage is a wo-
man's most important goal.

As actress Donna Mills, 41, says,
“There's no stigma attached to a
woman not being married anymore."

So why conduct the survey? Why
perpetuate the myth?" (Media Action
Alert)

“Total stories filed by female
correspondents at all the networks
was 14.9%; at ABC, women filed 26%
of the stories reported on World
News Tonight; at CBS, women filed
11.6% of the stories reported on
the Evening News; at NBC, women
filed 16.8% of the total stories
reported on the Nightly News.”
(Media Action Alert)

“The March 31 cover story in News-
week magazine once again points the
finger of blame at the woman. “Ameri-
ca's Mothers: Making It Work” focuses
on how mothers must balance the de-
mands of jobs and children, rather
than making it a joint responsibility
between both parents. The article
emphasizes repeatedly that women
feel guilty...women feel defensive
about the choices they have made...
women must make the choice to com-
promise.

The story's lead photo shows a
visibly distressed mother and daugh-
ter parting at the day care center.
The big, bold headline reads: "A
Mother's Choice.”

Why must the responsibility be
exclusively on the woman? Even when
the article touches on men helping
out, these "Mr. Moms” are described
as “super” dads when they contribute
to child-rearing and household chores.

One husband said men don't do more
at home because they worry “that
they're not going to be as valued by
women, they're not going to be as
valued by employers and they're not
going to be as valuable to society.”
Hmm, sounds a lot like what women
have been protesting for years.

. for me to wake up and start the day

Neither bitter cold nor pouring rain
could change this routine; I simply
dressed accordingly and took my
umbrella...

..This particular morning,
I had turned the first corner and
begun the long downhill block
when I saw a distant figure approach-
ing. At that hour, about 7:00 A.M.,
there are usually few pedestrians;
and my mind switched on alert.

As if drawn together by some
magnetic force [I thought], I con-
tinued downhill, he continued uphill.
As he came closer, my apprehension
deepened. After all, he was a man...
and I was a woman - anything could
happen. Nevertheless, courage said,
"Keep Going!" and faith said,

“Don't worry - he's probably okay."

Twenty feet away - 10 feet
away - he looked menacing... was
that a weapon in his hand? As we met,
he jumped towards me. I jumped
back in fright, expecting the
worst. Then, the incredible hap-
pened. Roaring with laughter, he
looked back at me as he passed and
quickly went on his way. Managing
a weak smile back at him, I quickly
continued on my way.

It was a frightening exper-
ience - but oddly, also reassuring.
Reassuring in the sense that this
person - this stranger - this
strange man - certainly read my
fear but, by making a joke out of
it, made it absurd. The lesson for me:
Be cautious, but Don't Lose Your
Freedom to Fear.

I've kept walking.
