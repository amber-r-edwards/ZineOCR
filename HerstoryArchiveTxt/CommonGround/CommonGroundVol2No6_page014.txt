“All life in the earth begins to  
unfold as the waxing light is seen.  
Each seedling will sprout into its  
own self to inspire us to be  

truly free."¹  

One of the most elusive of the  
eight Sabbats of feminist witches and  
other pagans is a celebration that  
may be held February Eve, February  
first or second; it may be called  
Oimelc, Imolg, Imbolc in the Celtic  
tradition, or traced back to Luper-  
calia of Rome. With the spread of  
Christianity it became Candlemas  
(a Christian term, but often used by  
witches. See Z. Budapest and Star-  
hawk, for example), the Feast of  
St. Brigid and the Feast of the  
Purification of the Virgin. Call it  
what you will, it is a fire festival  

of unseen growth and  

celebrations of  
beginnings.  
Consider the image of the tree  
and the Earth Festivals or Sabbats  
of the Old Religion: “...the tree  
grows from the darkness and the  
underworld into light and conscious-  
ness. It is anchored in the under-  
world and grows toward the heavens."  
The tree is "...of the underworld,  
the earth, the heavens. The wonder  
of the tree continues to exist to-  
day, for although we still cannot  
explain the mystery of the first  
seed, we can take the seed in our  

hand and say, here is the beginning  
of life. It will emerge from the  
underworld, strive toward the heav-  
ens, to die back into the underworld  
from which one of its descendants  
will emerge."² As the seed sprouts  
unseen beneath the earth before any  
new growth is visible above ground,  
this first cross-quarter day recog-  
nizes these invisible beginnings.  
At Winter Solstice we celebrate the  
next point on the wheel of life.  

In many covens this is the time  
for initiation, for taking new  

members in the circle. The initiate  
is barely a sprout. Her growth is  
just beginning, not yet visible. For  
individual witches, members of cov-  
ens or practicing alone, this Sabbat  
is also a time of renewal and rededi-  
cation. The introspective and quiet  
time which began with Hallowmas is  
ending. The seeds have been planted  
and the new sun is warming them.  
Sprouts of new growth are beginning.  
It is a time for new projects, new  
learning, meeting new people, stok-  
ing the fire under your cauldron.  

It is time to take Brigit back  
from the patriarchy. Celtic Brigit,  
a Triple Goddess, was known and  
loved throughout the British Isles,  
France, Spain and other parts of  
pagan Europe. She watches over  
poets and brings inspiration; she  
is Goddess of healing and medicine,  
and of smithcraft. She is a fire  
Goddess who once had 19 priestesses  
tending her holy fire at Kildare.  
With the Christianization of Ireland  
she became St. Bridget, her temple  
a convent and her priestesses nuns  
who continued to tend the holy fire.  
The bishops of St. Bridget were re-  
quired to be goldsmiths! In 1220  

C.E., the church fathers, recognizing  
the truth of Brigit, ordered the  
fire extinguished.  

Now 764 years later, women also  

recognize the truth of Brigit as one  
aspect of the Goddess—Maiden, Mother,  
Crone—creator and destroyer. We  
again seek her inspiration for our  
arts, her teachings for our craft,  
and her healing powers that we may  
become whole. We know that our power  
is from within, not the "power over"  
of patriarchy. The earth cycles  
teach us to live in harmony as sis-  
ters with all life forms. We do not  
need to "master" or "control" our  
environment.  

For women wondering what to do  
with this festival, or how to begin  
to understand the Goddess in your  
own life, let me suggest the following:  
Pick your time, February Eve  
or first or second. Light a white  
candle to reclaim our herstory. Plant  
a seed for our invisible beginnings.  
Perform a self-blessing ritual to  
affirm yourself.³  

"And like the rolling world,  
the wheel of life is a-turning.  
We weave the circle dance upon  
this rolling world of learning.”  

P.S. Grandmother Groundhog reminds  
us that on February 2, it is not the  
Groundhog “he" who does or doesn't see  
a shadow. The seasons, the earth,  
are Hers. If a groundhog's shadow  

is an omen, it is the Groundhog "She"  
who will or will not cast it. Grand-  
mother Groundhog also suggests that  
you take spring as you will—February  
2 of the Old Calendar or  

later at the Vernal Equinox—it is  
yours to enjoy.  

Blessed Be.
