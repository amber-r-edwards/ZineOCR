EMMA IS...

...ready for the New Year with
great calendars. Stop by to see
and get one while they last!

1985 Heroines; edited by Andrea
Flick Clardy, is a handsome wall
calendar in cranberry, black and
white with pictures of women from
our past and present, well known
and not-so-known. As the preface
says so well: “our heroines broad-
en the base of our becoming, spark
our imagination and encourage our
commitment to do more than the
expected, to be all that we can
dream." $6.95.

The Strength of Women, 1985:
edited by Nancy Berano, in laven-
dar, black and white, has great
photos of women young and old, in
all walks of life, that we can
identify with. Wonderful commen-
tary with each photo and great
quotes by well known feminists
to cherish. $6.95.

Can't Kill the Spirit-1985 Peace
Calendar: by the Syracuse Cultural
Workers Project is once again
chockful of large color pictures,
significant historical notations,
Spanish/English is used for days
and months and descriptions of
the artwork presented. A wall
calendar anyone would enjoy.
(Perhaps we should send one to
Mr. Reagan.)

The ‘85 Lunar Calendar (dedicated
to the Goddess in her many guises)
editor and publisher Nancy Passmore,
is the 9th annual in this series.
Organized by lunar months depicted
by spiral phases of the moon
beginning with the new moon, wax-
ing to the full moon and waning
to the new again. This unique
calendar has much information and
includes a bibliography for those
who wish to pursue the informa-
tion in greater detail. $10.00.

The Women Writers Desk Calendar,
edited by Elaine Goldman Gill and
Mary Gilliland is an appointment
calendar with photos of your favor-
ite women writers, short biograph-
ies and writings.

The 1985 Sylvia Book of Days,
by Nicole Hollander. Not only a
neat appointment calendar, but
chockful of humor (Yes, Virginia,
feminists do have a sense of
humor!) $6.95.

Speaking of Sylvia, we have sever-
al titles by Nicole Hollander
that are great for chasing the
mid-winter blues. For example,
My Weight is Always Perfect for
My Height--Which Varies, Sylvia
on Sundays, Mercy, It's the Revo-
lution and I'm Still in my Bath-
robe, and others. Also in stock
are Sylvia greeting cards.

Correspondence stickers are
in also and are a handy way to
leave a message.

We also have some new mugs
with feminist messages.

Start your New Year with
a visit to EMMA to stock up on reading for
those long, cold winter nights.

EMMA is located at 168 Elmwood
Ave., and is run by an all-volun-
teer women's collective. We are
looking hard for women in the
community who may be willing to
join the collective, or just to
learn to staff at the store a
couple of hours a week. Please
call us-885-2285.

NOTES FROM WAND

Along with other peace and
progressive groups in the area,
WAND members have received a
"Pledge of Resistance,” asking
individuals to pledge to support
resistance to an invasion of Ni-
caragua/Central America by U.S.
military forces.

The rationale behind The Pledge
is to mobilize concerns of U.S.
citizens before the fact, as in
the Vietnam War. The Pledge asks
people to secure nonviolence
training, and to either engage
in nonviolent civil disobedience
or to support others taking this
action. WAND believes it is im-
portant to understand the connec-
tions between the various kinds
of war, and war preparation cur-
rently going on, whether it in-
volves the funding, building and
deployment of Cruise missiles
for invasion of Nicaragua.

Anyone interested in
finding out more about The Pledge
should call the Western New York
Peace Center at 835-4073.

Now that the election is over
and the new year is upon us, many
of us are trying to pick up the
pieces, look at them and put it
all together to understand where
we should put our energies. And
upon second look, the election
wasn't so devastating, Reagan's
“sweep” not so clean. The new
Congress has been described as
“less compliant" than the one
elected four years ago; and in
the Senate, the Democrats made a
net gain of two seats. In addition,
some of the Republican win-
ners in the House were replacing
conservative Democrats who often
voted for Reagan. In addition,
of the 40 strong peace candidates
for Congress the WAND PAC endorsed,
20 were elected, including 4 Senate
seats. So it is not a time for
despair but rather a time to take
heart, to look ahead to the future,
and to utilize all our energies
to control an arms race and war
mentality that threatens us all.

Locally, the Congressional
Districts are continuing to meet,
and interested women can phone
the following numbers: Buffalo
2-6496 (evenings); 4397;
Amherst area, M,
Eileen 838-4397;
and southtowns, Diane
662-9690.

The WAND tree at the Children's
Hospital Festival of Trees, de-
corated with the theme
"Ask the World of Children"
was a great success.

The next general meeting is
January 16. Phone 835-4073 for
location. We've got a lot of
work to do, but we can do it.
All interested women are invited
to attend.

CALL FOR
MATERIAL

Common Ground has applied for an
Arts Development Service grant to
produce a special Arts Issue of Common
Ground in March of 1985. The ADS grant
will enable us to give a small honorarium
for submissions we accept for
publication in that one issue, and to
produce a performance night of selected
authors/artists whose work we
publish, to be held in mid-April, 1985.
A panel of local writers and artists
will help select the material and
performers.

"Women Express" will be the name of this
March 1985 issue of the newsjournal.
We are calling for material from Erie
County that captures the essence of
women's various perspectives. We are
looking for material that actively
expresses women's participation in
the world.

We are looking for original
essays, short stories, excerpts from
longer works, fiction, humor, poetry,
arts criticism (dance, music, visual
art, performance art, reviews), musical
lyrics, black and white photographs,
dramatic works, graphics (high contrast
black and white) never previously
published.

We will also consider a prospectus
for an article on an arts event/review
which would be impossible to complete
due to the earliness of our deadline.

We are also looking for artwork for
the cover of the issue which best
conveys the theme of the issue.

Material not selected for this
special issue may be held for publi-
cation in another issue under our
regular selections/submissions policy.

In addition, we will select several
authors/artists to be invited to read/
perform/exhibit at a special evening of
entertainment in mid-April. Those
selected will be offered an additional
honorarium.

MARCH 1985
SUBMISSIONS POLICY

Written work (except poetry) should

Put your name, address, work and home
phone number on each page. Please
suggest a title for your work. Include
a sentence or two of biographical infor-
mation, and a self-addressed, stamped

Put your name, address and phone
numbers on each page. Include a

performance night, please indicate
this in a separate cover letter,
accompanied by a collection of per-
formance material of 20 minutes in
length. Songwriters/singers will be

Our selections panel reserves the
right to accept or reject any material
submitted for this issue. They may
also choose to hold over any material
for another issue unless the author/
artist indicates she does not find
this acceptable in a cover letter at
the time of submission. The selections
panel will edit for spelling, grammar
and punctuation. The panel may also
ask the author/artist to edit her own
work, with the panel's suggestions,
but in this case it is the author/
artist’s responsibility for changes
in her own work.

DEADLINE JAN 15, 1985.
