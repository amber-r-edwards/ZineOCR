THE TAROT'S  
ORIGINS may go  

back as far as  
ancient Egyptian  
dynasties, and  
various scholars have  
linked the Tarot to  
Hebrew Kabala, Gnostics,  
Medieval courts, Gypsies,  
astrology, and numerology,  

among many other possible  
origins or historic influences.  
It has been variously attributed  
to devil worship, and been claimed  

as the “keys” to a cycle of Great  

Mysteries of a lost religion or books  

of knowledge reputed to rival modern  

science. In other words: nobody knows.  

The Tarot deck consists of 78 cards, 56 of  
which are called minor arcana, and 22 major  
arcana or court cards. Wands, Cups, Swords, and  
Pentacles are the names of the suits of cards.  
Each of the cards has a particular design on it,  
and, historically, has a particular divinatory  
meaning attributed to it. To do a reading,  
you decide how you want to mix the cards, how you  
want to choose them for the reading, and what  
question you want the cards to help you answer.  
There are many books available to guide you in  
your choice of tarot deck and the ritual you  
will feel comfortable with for a reading. How  
you make these choices is up to you; there is  
no right or wrong way to do it, and no one  
interpretation of any particular configuration of  
the cards. The beauty of Tarot is its ability  
to be interpreted in more than one way.  

For the above reading, I used the Amazon  
Tarot deck, and an astrological layout of the  
cards. Three of us shuffled the cards, and I  
cut them three times to the left. I took the  
top thirteen cards for the reading.  

The cards are placed around the zodiac  
wheel, the first one in the center at zero, and  
then following around from the First House,  
Aries, to the last, in order.  

The cards have their own intrinsic significance,  
and depending on where they land on  
the zodiac, will tell you what is happening in  
that particular aspect of your life.  

I have labeled the wheel with the zodiac  
sun sign/meaning of this spoke of the wheel  

or “House,” and under that a second interpretation  

of what life aspect is ruled by this House.  

Each card is labeled with its name, suit  
symbol, planetary and zodiac attributes, and  
has printed on it a short interpretation of  
the card.  

To do a reading of this layout of cards,  
first get a general feeling. Are there a  
lot of one kind of suit? Do you have a  
lot of major arcana, indicating a very  
strong reading? Do the cards repeat the  
same meaning in several places, e.g., gain,  
loss, conflict, attainment? What tone  
does the significator, in the center,  
suggest about the reading as a whole?  

After you get a general overview of  
the reading you are ready to do the  
interpretation of each card in relationship  
to where it is in the layout.  

I'll repeat the one certainty about Tarot:  

there is no one way to do this, so what  

follows is my personal interpretive offering.  

Get your own cards out on New Year's Eve  
and have a good time!

(9) SIGNIFICATOR: This card indicates  
the general tone of the reading and will influence  
the other cards' interpretations,  
especially weaker cards. The 5 of Pentacles  
indicates transition, change, movement or  

especially in the areas of money  

or security. Things are not stable. This  
card means that for the next year, there  
will be change.  

This is the Self position. The  
sign indicates security, contentment,  
integration and expansion,  

it is also a card indicating the  
reinforces the interpretation of  
Coming into Your Own.
