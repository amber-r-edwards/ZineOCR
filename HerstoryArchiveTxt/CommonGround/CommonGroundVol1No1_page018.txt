Dear Readers:  

When I first became a State Legislator eight years ago,  
I was amazed how few people seemed to realize the impact  
that decisions made in Albany have on their lives.  

As an Assemblyman, I have continually searched for  
ways to let Western New Yorkers know about pending  
legislation, new laws, or State programs that affect them.  
I am delighted to know that COMMON GROUND will  
serve to help keep the women of our area aware and  
informed on crucial matters.  

As we have certainly come to learn, who we elect to  
serve in our houses of government does make a difference.  
I hope every COMMON GROUND reader is registered to  
vote. If you are not, and would like a voter registration  
form, just call my office at (716) 847-3100.
