An Incident in a Bar

An Incident in a Bar, or,  
How My Husband Defended my Honor  
and I Found a New Perspective  

by Hope Hoetzer-Cook  

I must admit, that like many  
pro-choice women, the arguments  
have gotten stale and a bit pro  
forma for me. Of course it's my  
body. Of course it's my decision  
to live in it as I see fit. Of  
course it's a male-dominated  
society trying to control me as a  
breeder, and use that excuse to  
keep my wages down, my hiring  
tentative, and my position low to  
middling. Of course it's unfair.  
Of course I'm angry. Of course.  

I really have my husband and a  
casual incident to thank for  
rethinking the issue, and learning  
to translate it into male language.  

Following a Democratic Zone  
meeting that I had called, we went  
downstairs to the bar at Cole's for  
a glass of wine. We had interviewed  
candidates that night, and all the  
women Committee Members in my Zone  
(and most of the men) had carefully  
taken note of which candidates  
fudged or failed the Choice issue.  

Buff State students had invaded  
the lower level, but they were  
basically harmless, friendly, and  
with a touch of the vine,  
garrulous. As Philip went to  
tackle the bar, a denimed,  
long-haired, cause-buttoned and  
bearded sophisticate about half my  
age gave me the traditional eyeball  
and greeting: “Wanna drink, baby?"  

The lighting was admittedly  
poor. He had obviously missed the  
grey. My proof of survival.  

"No thanks, I have one on the  
way. My husband's getting it."  

"You married? Kids?"  

“No children, one husband."  

"You don't like kids?"  

"I've chosen not to have kids.  
At least not now."  

"You one of those feminists?"  

"Yup. So's my husband."  

"I thought feminists were just  
women."  

"Nope."  

"You're for abortion, huh?"  

"Well, I wouldn't put it quite  
like that. Nobody's FOR abortion,  
but yes, I certainly believe in my  
right to make my own moral  
decisions, especially when they  
affect my life."  

"What about your husband? He  
doesn't feel that way, does he?"  

"Of course he does. I wouldn't  
have married him if he didn't feel  
I was a capable adult."

"What does that have to do with  
it? Abortion is killing babies."  

I sighed. Another example of  
Ronald Reagan Republicanism wrapped  
in bluejeans and youth. Corrupt,  
positively corrupt. This kid was  
too young to be this conservative.  
That's the problem with those of us  
who never abandoned the L label -  
we find it hard to believe the next  
generation views us as closet  
Commies. And that they'll probably  
do away with our Social Security.  
I lit another cigarette.  

"You shouldn't smoke. It's not  
good for you."  
Hypocrite. Cigarettes aren't  
good for me, forced pregnancy is.  
"When you get pregnant, you'll  
have the opportunity to make the  
choice yourself."  
"That's not the point. Men  
don't get pregnant, but they're  
Fathers. They should have a say,  
too. It's their kids, too. And  
women who have abortions feel lousy  
about themselves."  

"For you guys, it's mainly a one  
shot deal, especially if there's no  
marriage, or a divorce. The  
majority of Fathers never even pay  
child support. On the other hand,  
it's a minimum eighteen year  
commitment for the women. Abortion  
is a last resort, and no woman  
feels good about it. It's a hard  
decision, never a snap judgment.  
But it's obscene to legislate my  
autonomy as a human being dependent  
on someone else's view of whether  
or not I should reproduce."  

"What does that have to do with  
it?"  

Philip had returned in time to  
catch the gist of the conversation.  
He tried reason - the “woman has a  
right to choose because" approach.  
Then he tried the "as a male, I  
believe" approach. No go. Then he  
tried the global approach: "in  
other countries." Another failure.  
"Rape and incest." "Life of  
Mother." "Why don't YOU adopt."  
De nada. It all boils down to  
baby killing. Philip, more than a  
bit irked, gave a chance to the  
"when does life really begin after  
all approach?" Nope.  

As jaded as it sounds, I was  
beginning to enjoy myself. This  
kid was a stranger, couldn't be  
convinced, and I no longer  
frustrated myself by proselytizing  
brick walls. I had said these  
words for years, and it was rather  
nice to stand there and feel my  
knight was charging forward on my  
behalf. Into a brick wall. Even  
if he was beginning to lose it.

"YOU ASSHOLE - KEEP YOUR HANDS  
OUT OF MY WIFE'S WOMB!"  

I liked that. I recognized the  
anger as my own, and once again  
congratulated myself for choosing  
an intelligent partner.  

Maybe it was the wine. Maybe it  
was just the relief of watching  
someone else lose it on the issue.  
I started laughing. It was all  
quite clear.  

I looked at the kid - who by now  
was fairly sure he was in danger of  
assault by a rabid man over six  
foot tall who seriously outweighed  
him and who should have been his  
natural ally - and gave it one last  
attempt.  

"It's like this. You can  
legislate my eggs. Fine. Throw me  
in jail every month when I have my  
period for throwing out a  
half-life. Or prosecute women who  
have miscarriages for murder. Or  
even force twelve year olds  
gang-raped by their uncles to carry  
full term, drop out of school, and  
get prosecuted for being abusive  
mothers.  

But that's only half the deal.  

Your sperm are equally precious.  
I care about them. They are the  
other half, as it were, and as  
filled with life as my eggs. You  
want to legislate my eggs - I want  
to legislate your sperm. I don't  
want even one wasted. I want you  
to guard them as carefully as you  
want to guard my eggs. I want you  
to eat right, dress for maximum  
sperm production, and take personal  
responsibility for each and every  
one of them.  

Now, when was the last time you  
jacked off?"  

I enjoyed his blush.
