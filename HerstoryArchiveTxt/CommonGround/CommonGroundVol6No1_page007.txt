Certified Nurse Midwives  
Practice in Buffalo  

By Deb Boman  

What makes the certified Nurse-  
Midwife (CNM) unique? And are  
midwives more women-centered than  
the Physician?  

These are questions asked by  
many consumers as well as other  
health professionals today. Yet  
the real answer lies in the hearts  
of those consumers who have received  
care by the Nurse-Midwife or  
both, the Physician and Nurse-  
Midwife.  

As a CNM I feel that we are  
unique in that our philosophy is  
based on the beliefs that every  
childbearing family has a right  
to a safe, satisfying maternity  
experience with respect for human  
dignity and worth; for variety in  
cultural forms, for the parent's  
right to self-determination, to  
adequate information and to active  
participation in all aspects of  
care.  

CNMs see birth as a normal  
process rather than as an illness,  
and because we focus our care on  
the healthy woman, we can therefore  
offer a comprehensive maternity  
service, including education and  
emotional support as well as man-  
agement of physical care throughout  
the childbearing years.  

A Certified Nurse-Midwife is a  
highly trained health professional  
educated in the two disciplines  
of Nursing and Midwifery and has  

Parents Anonymous (PA) is an  
organization that is made up of  
people who have one goal in  
common: they want to be good  
parents and raise children into  
strong, healthy happy adults.  
They provide a place where you  
can share with other parents  
some of your negative feelings  
about parenthood. When you  
feel you need someone to talk  
to, there is a 24-hour Help-  
Line. You can also receive  
information about a PA group  
meeting near you, as well as  
information on other family  
resources in the community.  

For additional support,  
weekly self-help group meet-  
ings are available. Group  
provides an opportunity for  
parents to share problems,  
give support, and develop  
solutions. Free child care  
and help with transportation  
are provided. Everyone is  
assured of complete confi-  
dentiality.  

PA is staffed by volunteers,  
and offers of help would be  
appreciated. Needed are:  
staffers for the Help-Line,  
childcare, community education  
volunteers, transportation pro-  
viders, office support, group  
facilitators, help with arts,  
crafts, music and holiday events.  

Parents Anonymous will have  
a more lengthy article describ-  
ing their services and needs  
in the October issue of Common  
Ground.

successfully completed the National  
Certification examination given by  
the American College of Nurse-Mid-  
wives. In order to be eligible to  
take this certification examination,  
Registered Nurses must complete an  
accredited education program which  
includes theoretical courses and  
supervised clinical practice.  
Whether diploma, B.S., M.S., or  
Ph.D. degree prepared, emphasis  
is placed on clinical expertise  
for the management of normal women  
throughout the entire maternity  
cycle: in family planning, pre-  
natal, labor and delivery, post-  
partum, newborn and infant care  
to one year of life.  

At the present time there are  
28 educational programs in the  
U.S. There are two programs in  
New York and one Nurse-Midwifery  
program pending at the University  
of Buffalo. Most educational  
programs take from one to two years  
to complete.  

Certified Nurse-Midwives work  
in clinical collaboration with  
physicians. The standards of the  
American College of Nurse-Midwives  
require CNMs to have an alliance  
agreement and health care protocols  
with a physician in order to prac-  
tice; therefore consultation and  
referral service is readily avail-  
able when complications arise.  
When a consumer chooses Nurse-  
Midwifery care she is, in fact,  
choosing a health care team.  

CNMs work in a variety of  
settings such as a  

standing birth center. They may  
work for a prepaid Health Main-  
tenance Organization (HMO) or a  
public health department or clinic.  
The Federal government has long  
utilized nurse-midwives in its  
programs, including the Indian  
Health Services, Improved Preg-  
nancy Outcome Projects and the  
U.S. military.  

Presently there are five CNMs  
practicing in the Buffalo area.  
Two CNMs work for an HMO and three  
others in a private/physician set-  
ting. However, there are no mid-  
wifery services available to the  
low-income patient in a clinic  
setting, an aspect of care to  
strive for in the future.
