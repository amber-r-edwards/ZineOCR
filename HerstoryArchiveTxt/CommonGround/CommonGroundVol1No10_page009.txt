ELDER ABUSE  

By Diane C. Prochownik  

Lena, a ninety-year-old nursing  
home resident, was repeatedly hit and  
shoved by her seventy-five-year-old  
roommate. Both were Medicaid recip-  
ients in the Health Related Facility  
of a large, county-operated insti-  
tution, but despite occasional  
bruises, Lena was not believed by the  
nurses, aides, and social workers.  

In the first place, English was not  
her native tongue and, as she grew  
older, her mind reverted to the lan-  
guage she had been raised with. Then  
there was the matter of memory re-  
tention. Lena was not confused and  
could tell you of incidents from her  
youth in the clearest details. Yet,  
five minutes after her roommate hit  
her, she might not remember the in-  
cident. The truth of Lena's asser-  
tions was discovered when an aide  
responded to her yells and found the  
roommate beating Lena around the head  
with a slipper.  

Sarah, an eighty-year-old Skilled  
Nursing Home Facility patient, had  
once held a doctorate in her field.  
Her numerous medical problems had  
left her bedridden and unable to  
speak, but her family was able to  
provide a private duty aide to sup-  
plement the home's regular staff.  
The aide was often unnecessarily  
rough in her handling of Sarah. When  
bathing or changing Sarah, or her  
bedclothes, the woman was frequently  
left exposed to any eyes that happened  
to glance into her room through the  
open door. The aide called Sarah  

COMMON GROUND — JUNE 1983  

“honey," "sugar," or by her first  
name. She was eventually dismissed by  
Sarah's family when the regular staff  
found evidence of bruises on Sarah's  
thighs and buttocks.  

Mary comes from European peasant  
stock and never had much education.  
At seventy-eight, she had outlived her  
family and the small, lifetime sav-  
ings that were supposed to care for her  
in her old age. She did have enough  
physical problems to qualify her for a  
lower level of Medicaid-augmented  
nursing home care. These included  

a hearing impairment that didn't re-  
spond well to hearing aids, and in-  
operable cataracts, which interfered  
with her reading vision in spite of  
the use of very thick glasses. She  
also had bowel and bladder urgency,  
which kept her in constant search of  
a bathroom. Her fellow residents  
often harassed her, telling her it  
was "all in her head," calling her  
"ignorant," and even threatening to  
"tell the nurses she tied up the  
bathrooms." Mary was afraid  

they would do that, and that she  
would lose her place to live. She  
inadvertently solved her own  
problem when she told one woman,  
"You should have what I have," and  
the woman took Mary's words as a  
curse.  

All violations are reportable  
under the law, and a sustained de-  
termination [conviction], based  

on sufficient credible evi-  
dence, can result in a fine,  

after a hearing, loss of  
license (if one is in-  
volved), and undoubt-  
edly suspension which  
will lead to termina-  

tion.  

The nursing home  
scandals of the 1970s  
created the patient abuse  
laws of the 1980s, yet it  
is interesting to note the  
semantics that surfaced as  
part of the patient abuse  
policies and procedures. The  
term "abuse" becomes defined as  
"inappropriate physical contact,  
including but not limited to  
striking, pinching, kicking,  
shoving, bumping, and sexual  
molestation." The term "mistreat-  
ment" becomes “inappropriate isolation,  
or inappropriate use of physical or  
chemical restraints." And the term  
"neglect" is identified as "failure  
to provide timely, consistent, safe,  
adequate, and appropriate services,  
treatment, and/or care," and covers a  
variety of areas ranging from nu-  
trition through activities of daily  
living.  

But what of the Lenas, Sarahs, and  
Marys? Their abuse is a matter of  
attitudes and a lack of respect for  
them as individuals. The fact that  
Lena was not believed, and that no one  
on the staff had the patience to try  
to understand her was far more devas-  

tating than the blows inflicted on  
her by her roommate. Sarah received  
rough physical handling, which cannot  
ever be condoned, but she was also  
stripped of her dignity and treated  
in a demeaning manner. Then there was  
Mary, ridiculed by an unsympathetic  
peer group, afraid because, in in-  
stitutionalized living, the staff  
becomes the reigning authority. With  
nursing home facilities always under-  
staffed, and that staff invariably  
underpaid as well as overworked,  
these authority figures are not seen  
as allies.  

That is not to say that there are  
not a great many dedicated and caring  
professionals working in the nursing  
home field. I've seen them in action  
and what they provide often goes far  
beyond their job requirements. But  
institutionalization of any sort,  
including nursing homes, makes it  
possible to lump people into cate-  
gories. In nursing homes, sen-  
sitivity and respect for the patient  
tends to be distorted. It is not  
only distorted between staff and  
patients but between patients them-  
selves. Perhaps the real abuse  
perpetrated in nursing homes is  
[the resident] knowing he or she is  
old and helpless but not sure that  
anyone cares. It makes dependency  
precarious. ©
