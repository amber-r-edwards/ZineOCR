CHILDBIRTH COALITION

The Buffalo Childbirth Coalition  
(formerly the Buffalo Committee for  
Birth Alternatives), brings together  
a diverse group of people with dif-  
ferent interests and skills "to  
celebrate childbirth.”

One of its goals is to establish  
a freestanding birth center. Over  
50% of their questionnaires have  
been returned demonstrating the  
need for a center in Buffalo, and a  
site and architects have been chosen.  
The center will hopefully be open  
within one year.

The coalition has almost completed  
its request for non-profit status.  
Other projects include compiling an  
oral history on homebirths, public  
education and fundraising events.

Future activities include a sem-  
inar on "Siblings at Birth" in Feb-  
ruary (details to be announced). There  
will be a public informational event  
on birthing options in the community  
featuring speakers and movies some-  
time in late winter/spring. Local  
fundraising activities are scheduled  
for spring. Watch for it! Also  
ASPO, the local Lamaze group, will be  
sponsoring speaker Diony Young at  
their May conference. Contact Libby  
Pideon, 873-2590 for more info.  
Meetings of the Buffalo Childbirth  
Coalition are held every third week  
of the month at 7:30 p.m. Upcoming  
meetings are: Wed. Feb. 15 @ 349  
Bryant, and Wed. Mar. 21 @ 622  
Richmond. For more info call  
Trudy Stern 883-8497

a special program in the auditorium  
of the Central Library, Monday,

RAPE AND SEXUAL ASSAULT

The Speakers' Bureau of the Erie  
County Citizens’ Committee on Rape  
and Sexual Assault is looking for  
interested volunteers to speak  
throughout Erie County.

Individuals and agencies who serve  
victims of rape and sexual assault tell  
us, and statistics verify, the chilling  
realities of rape and sexual assault.  
Rape can happen to anyone, any time,  
any place. No one is immune from the  
crime or its shattering after effects.  
The first step in prevention of this  
crime is awareness: Awareness that  
rape occurs and that it can happen to  
you. Once this realization is made,  
awareness of common sense safety  
measures helps reduce one's vulnerabil-  
ity.  
The Speakers' Bureau is committed  
to a community-wide education and pre-  
vention program accomplished in part  
by providing trained volunteers to  
speak to agencies, organizations, and  
schools on the topic of rape and  
sexual assault.

The Speakers' Bureau is now active  
recruiting volunteers to talk throughout  
Erie County to help dispel the  
myths surrounding rape and to give  
common sense safety measures. The  
next training session will be in March.  
If you are interested or would like  
more information concerning the  
Speakers’ Bureau, call us at 846-7879  
or write c/o Erie County Health De-  
partment, 95 Franklin Street, Room  
B00, Buffalo, New York 14202.
