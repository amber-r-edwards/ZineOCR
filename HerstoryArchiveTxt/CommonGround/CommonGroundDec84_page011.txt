Thinking about buying a purse for
a woman on your Christmas list this
year? Well, this column first;
you may have second thoughts.

Of course, you might feel that a
purse is not a wise choice for a
gift, that one's preference for
purses is much too subjective, much
too personal for another to know.
Perhaps true, but when we consider
the “politics" of carrying a purse
at all, some even more serious con-
siderations arise, which
make you reconsider buying a purse
for a friend, or even for yourself.

As we all know, carrying a purse
makes you very vulnerable to purse-
snatchers and muggers. The most
obvious content of any woman's purse—
her wallet—is a great temptation to
some, especially if that woman is
elderly; if she carries her purse
loosely or carelessly; if her wallet
is visible inside, or if she is ab-
sorbed in talking to someone else
or making a purchase. Cognizant of
this, we try to avoid carrying large
amounts of cash, but even the theft
of credit cards can lead to abuse,
not to mention the horror of having
your address and phone number in a
thief's hands, as well as the in-
convenience of having to replace
stolen documents. And more than one
woman has received a beating at the
hands of a purse-snatcher who becomes
irate upon finding little or no
money in her purse.

To me, this vulnerability is poli-
tically keenly felt by women than by men.
Oh yes, men get wallets hoisted out
of their back pockets, but because
of the proximity of these wallets
to men's bodies, such a theft is
much more difficult. In fact, this
act is most often perpetrated by a
pickpocket working in a crowd, where
the victim would be apt to be un-
aware of a slight nudge amidst the
expected bumps and bustle.

A more important contrast, how-
ever, is the fact that women are
more susceptible to purse snatching
than men are to wallet-filching,
because women are still viewed as
the weaker sex. Men (and, by the
way, most purse-snatchers are of
this sex!) believe that because of
our size and our socialization,
most of us women are either afraid
to, or unable to, defend ourselves.
After all, many of us do not know
how to defend ourselves, and this
is certainly tragic.

So if it is potentially dangerous
to carry a purse, why do so many of
us persist in lugging them around
wherever we go? As one who tries to
avoid taking a purse whenever feas-
ible, I know all too well that most
women's clothes simply do not have
ample pocket space to accommodate
even such basic necessities as a
wallet, keys and perhaps a checkbook.
Clothing designers and manufacturers
have subtly (perhaps even unknowingly)
yet powerfully discriminated
against women for years in this re-
gard. After all, what pair of men's
pants does not have at least two
good-sized pockets?

Of course, women's jeans and
corduroys usually have an equivalent
number of pockets, and when I wear
these, I can often do without a
purse. But many women cannot dress
this casually when they work.
Dresses, often with few or no pockets,
demand an accompanying purse, not
just to complete “the look," but
for the sake of function. I hail
the return of women's suits, not
just because we look more serious
than sexy in them, but just as im-
portantly, because they usually have
two or three pockets.

Furthermore, let us not forget
the many women who are not built
like undernourished-looking models.

PURSES

If you are overweight or even very
tall, finding jeans or suit jackets
to fit is quite a formidable task,
and even when they are unearthed,
they are often exorbitantly priced.
Thus many of these women are denied
both flattering and functional attire.
I've yet to see a pair of polyester
pull-ons with pockets, a phenomenon
that I experienced when I had to wear
maternity slacks. 

Although our clothing frequently
requires the use of a purse, I do find winter clothing easier, because winter coats and
jackets not only have substantial
pockets, but also accommodate
nicely. For instance, keys in my
jeans jab my abdomen or leg and
bulge out when I walk, whereas keys
in the pockets of my parka are both
unobtrusive and comfortable.

Also, I have found that one of
the few fringe benefits of toting
around a diaper bag is that I can
put my wallet and keys safely into
it. (I doubt if many pickpockets
would delve into a diaper bag in
pursuit of a wallet!) I am
simply amazed at how many mothers
I've seen juggle 15 or 20 pounds of
baby, one-handed, while they sling
that heavy diaper bag over their
shoulders and then bend over to
grab their purses! Some liberation
from physical burden is surely
needed here (did someone say we're
peasants?)

Perhaps these women carry
items because their purses, chock
full of assorted items, seem so in-
dispensable. But this is another
gripe I have about purses: their
very existence encourages us to
haul around extraneous items. When
I first began putting my wallet and
keys in the diaper bag, I realized
how I could do just fine, thank you,
without all those other odds and ends
that I had simply transferred from
one purse to the next all those
years.

Yet most of the women who counter
that purses and their contents are
necessary are mothers. As one, I
am often torn over whether or not
to take a purse when I go out with
my kids. Articles such as scissors,
a pencil, band-aids, lots of tissues,
some paper, and wet-wipes are hardly
frivolous extras for any outing longer
than an hour. (And, yes, mothers do
consider carrying pictures of our
beautiful offspring a must at all
times!) The only solution I see is to either pack all such items in a purse,
but try to keep money in pockets, or to carry some sort of small bag that doesn't look
like a purse.

And how a purse looks is also im-
portant. The more feminine and deli-
cate that it appears, the more vul-
nerable, I think, its owner is to
losing it. Many purses nowadays are
shoulder bags, which hang down as
far as the waist on a long, thin,
strap. How quickly that strap could
be snapped if someone were to give
the purse one hard yank. Next,
consider clutch bags; not only do
they restrict our movement and our
ability to use both hands, but it's
also obvious how easily they can be
grabbed from behind. Then there are
the old-style fat purses with short,
thick straps, the kind I often see
elderly women holding. Since the
strap is too short to sling over a
shoulder, these women weave their
hand and arm through the strap as
a visible deterrent to a would-be
purse-snatcher. Yet their age alone
makes them even more at risk, despite
such precautions.

Another "political" aspect of
purses is cost. As we all know,
purses are expensive, particularly
if they are leather, and those that

The Right to be Alone

by Mary Paleologos

The other day, I decided to
go jogging around the small park
the street from my home.

Toward the end of my first lap,
I spotted a group of six men sitting
together by the wayside.

"Please don't bother me," I
thought to myself, I was not in the
mood to be ogled, judged, or verbally
accosted by strangers. I wanted to
be left alone—a simple, but some-
times impossible wish for any woman
journeying solo.

Suddenly, the men opened
their mouths with a confidence only men
in large groups seem to possess.

Now, I’ve never been one to gnash
my teeth at a few stray whistles.
But to have my own business interrupted
by this club was too much.

“Mind your own business,” I blurted
out, unable to ignore their callousness.

They quickly regained their mo-
mentum and became a chorus of
threats and crude remarks. (I must
have really hurt their feelings.)

“What did you say, you bitch?"
one asked incredulously.

“I'll tie you up against that
tree and kick the hell out of you,”
yelled another. "I'll show you
who's boss!"

With that remark, I stopped dead
in my tracks. Any fear that I was
feeling evaporated in the heat of
anger.

You won't kick the hell out of
anyone," I shot back, "because I’ll
call the police!" (That was clear-
ly my only defense if they started
trouble.) As a woman alone,
I was pickings: anyone who had
the audacity to approach me was
ignorantly unaware of the process.

Isn't it enough that I must con-
stantly watch out for rapists, mug-
gers and stranglers, without having
to endure the badgering of “normal”
men as well?

When I was a child, that park
was my terrain. I played in it,
ran in it, and was never bothered
by anyone. Why now, as a grown wo-
man, couldn't I run around and be
left alone? What rights had I for-
saken when I passed into womanhood?

I began jogging again—this time
at Olympic speed. I worried that
they might try to run after me.

Their egos were so battered, they
were liable to do something drastic.
I wondered if going home wouldn't
be my safest bet. Fear and anger
were flooding my senses and delaying
my decision.

Finally, I decided to continue
on. Running home and hiding was
not the answer.

By succumbing to my own fears,
I would unwittingly verify their
obvious belief that getting tough
with a woman was the way to control
her. This same, distorted thinking
causes a man to feel he has the
right to smack his wife's face when
she gets too feisty, or to forcibly
pin down a date after she says “no”
to his sexual advances.

One may argue that yelling ob-
scene remarks to a woman has nothing
to do with rape or wife-beating.
Yet, the attitude of perceiving
women as objects is the psychologi-
cal frame-of-mind behind all three
acts.

It also struck me that a woman
had to be with a man, with a child,
or in a group to be left alone and
accorded respect by "normals." In
settings aside from shopping or
dining, a woman alone is too often
pestered and approached by men who
think they see an opportunity to
be more than just friends.

I remember a trip my friend
Gail had taken by herself to Las
Vegas.

On her first night there, she
casually walked through a casino,
checking out different games. A
man suddenly grabbed her by the
arm and said, “Hold on, Honey,
looks like I'm winning.”

She wrenched her arm back, slapped
his face, and walked away stunned
and guilt-ridden.

From that point on, she took
pains to avoid looking any man di-
rectly in the eyes, since he might
interpret the glance as a come-on.
She couldn't grab a bar stool or
lounge chair and people watch, be-
cause every person passing by would
think she was scoping out her ter-
ritory or waiting for a client.

And she was afraid to strike up a
friendly conversation lest a man
mistakenly think she was attempting
to solicit him.

In similar circumstances, a man
alone enjoys all these small freedoms
without worrying that the world is
judging him “good” or “bad.”

But my friend had to isolate her-
self to desperately maintain an
aura of respectability! She might
as well have stayed in her hotel
room. Being so guarded and aloof,
she was unable to enjoy the evening
and have a thoroughly good time.
Women are forever advised to
stop feeling that nothing is
interesting, exciting things by
themselves. But when they do, they
are harshly judged, harassed, and
often treated like sexual objects
instead of human beings.

No wonder women have a tough time
cultivating an independent spirit;
they quickly find out how frighten-
ingly vulnerable they are when
alone.

On my final lap, I noticed the
six men were intently playing bas-
ketball on one of the courts. I
wondered how they would feel if a
group of critics stood on the side-
lines and shouted remarks about
the way they dribbled, the shape of
their legs, or the bulge in their pants.

They would be enough to physically defend their right to privacy!
A woman, too, must fight to
protect her rights. In demeaning
instances of sexist behavior, a woman
can use a number of available re-
sources to promptly defend herself:
a sharp tongue, a quick wit, a call
to the police or proper authorities,
a can of Mace, a kick in the shins,
and a solid awareness of her rights
are all weapons at a woman's dispo-
sal when she is treated less than
human.

Only when a woman takes abuse on
top of abuse and remains silent does
she finally become an emotional bas-
ket case or explode into a seriously
violent episode. By nipping each
incident in the bud as it occurs,
a woman makes a small but strong
statement about her limits and does
not fall into the role of a perpe-
tual victim.

If each woman would speak up when
she is on the unfair end of a double
standard or is the target of a dis-
crimination, then she will be fight-
ing for her rights more effectively
and poignantly than any feminist
rally in Central Park can.

I'm sure it will be a long time
before the six men in the park mus-
ter up enough guts to bother the
next female jogger they see. In a
matter of five frightening minutes,
I managed to enlighten these fellows
on the hazards of shouting obscene
remarks to women they don’t even
know.
