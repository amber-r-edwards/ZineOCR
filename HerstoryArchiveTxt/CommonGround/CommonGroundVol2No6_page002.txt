CARASA VS. NFTA |

The First Amendment rides again—
on NFTA buses!! CARASA, Coalition
for Abortion Rights and Against
Sterilization Abuse, has won their
suit against the Niagara Frontier
Transit Authority, who refused paid
pro-choice advertisements to be
placed on the buses.

The placard that was turned down
by the NFTA shows four women and a
child, and has copy that says "Can
you tell which one of us had an
abortion? All of us. I'm 27. I'm
30. I'm 21 and a single mother. I
can't afford a child. I want one
later. I have to work. The reasons
are endless. Make sure the decision
is yours."

CARASA began the suit when the
bus company refused the advertising,
after the NFTA's advertising agency
gave the pro-choice group the go-
ahead.

Pat Swift, who writes the “Yonan-
scope" column for the Buffalo News,
mentioned in a March 19, 1983 column that
CARASA had been able to purchase ad-
vertising space on the buses. Irene
Engler, NFTA's public relations and
marketing director, saw the column
in the newspaper and went to her
supervisor, saying the CARASA ad
was inappropriate for the buses.
NFTA then notified their advertising
agency, Winston Network, Inc., to
cancel the contract for the pro-
choice ad.

CARASA went to Federal Court in
June, represented by Ellen Yacknin
and Laraine Kelley of the National
Lawyers Guild. Yacknin and Kelley
said that NFTA's rejection of the
ads was a violation of First Amend-
ment rights. They asked Judge John
T. Curtin for an injunction to allow
CARASA to place the ads on the buses.
They also requested damages of $100
a day for every day the group was
denied space from the time of the
rejection in April.

Yacknin and Kelley proved that
NFTA had never rejected an ad before,
and that the NFTA had permitted ads
from an anti-draft group, from Plan-
ned Parenthood (whose ad had men-
tioned abortion) and from a home for
unwed mothers that said "choose life".
They also brought to the attention
of the court that neither NFTA nor
Winston Network, Inc. had a written
or implicit policy for rejection of
advertising. The former executive di-
rector of the Authority said that
they would reject advertising that
"we wouldn't want our passengers
exposed to." Jack Hinen, present
executive director, defined the ads
as "controversial" and said "contro-
versial is a highly debated issue,
pro or con, like the death penalty."

On January 18, 1984, Judge Curtin
ruled in favor of CARASA, saying
"Where constitutionally protected
speech is thwarted, irreparable in-
jury results." Curtin ruled that the
NFTA may not favor certain non-com-
mercial messages over others in the
area it has created for “non-commer-
cial speech," and he granted a per-
manent injunction forbidding the
NFTA's denial of space inside buses
to CARASA.

Ellen Yacknin, CARASA's attorney,
said that the ads will not appear
right away. The NFTA is going to
appeal the decision in Second Circuit
Court in New York City. Curtin may
give them a limited stay to make
their appeal.

! which of us

Abortion will be against the law unless you
do something now!

All of us.

She also said, "The damage settle-
ment (of $100 a day since rejection)
is a secondary concern of CARASA's.
We will try to settle at another time
with NFTA. The placards are the
first priority."

"Two other cases like this have
come up," Yacknin told C.G. "One took
place in Washington, D.C. in 1979
when some gay activists tried to
place information on the buses. An-
other happened in Massachusetts in
1974, when an abortion clinic tried
to advertise. Both cases were “un-
official", settled out of court.

Ellen Yacknin ended with "I'm
pleased with the outcome. Judge
Curtin's decision reaffirms that the
First Amendment holds when govern-
ment agencies try to suppress mes—
sages solely because the messages
are the kind of messages the First
Amendment protects."

had an
abortion?

“I’m 27. I'm 30. I'm 21 and a single
mother. I can’t afford a child. I want
one later. I have to work.”

The reasons are endless.

Make sure the decision is yours!
