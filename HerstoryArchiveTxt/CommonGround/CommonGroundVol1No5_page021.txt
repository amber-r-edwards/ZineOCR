...enforcement of Title IX, which man-  
dated that sex-discrimination be elim-  
inated in federal and state educational  
programs, is getting some help from  
the Buffalo School System's additional  
curriculum guides and material. One  
piece, "T.N. and Turtle" is a cartoon  
book for young children which is help-  
ful in encouraging them to recognize  
sex-stereotype attitudes...N.O.W. is  
trying to introduce a law that goes  
beyond Title IX, because it has no  
real enforcement capabilities as  
written. N.O.W. is calling for express  
elimination of sexual harassment,  
removal/rewriting of sex-biased texts,  
and educating educators about sexism...

..-according to William Barrett in a  
story from the Dallas Times Herald,  

women in Beirut have organized a mis-  
sing persons registry. The Red Cross,  

which normally does this kind of work,  
has no authority when people are miss-  
ing at the hands of their own govern-  
ments or internal fighting. The women  
confronted the Prime Minister Shafik  
Wazzan in his office over his inability  
to get the identification of dead or  
missing persons moving more rapidly.  
Many women are missing sons, brothers  
and husbands -- more than 900 persons  
are missing after two massacres in  
refugee camps, according to Barrett.  
These women, like those in Argentina,  
Chile and other war-torn countries are  
demanding to know where their loved-  
ones are...

-.-a landmark discrimination case was  
won by women seeking jobs as long-  
shore workers and marina clerks, ac-  
cording to an article in the Wall  
Street Journal. The settlement could  
result in 700 women being hired at the  
port in Los Angeles. It is the first  

settlement which sets hiring goals for  
women in the longshore industry..

“Did your education give you knowledge of women  
artists, such as women writers, women painters,  

QUESTION:  

women composers,  

=  

Felicia Bad, Cheektowaga:  
"Women writers were introduced,  
but I don't remember learning about  
any female composers, nor very few  
women painters or fine artists. I  
think all of my professors were male,  
too. I think somewhere they ought to  
show people women artists, in order  
to show that the arts are not just  
male-dominated. I think there have  
to be more women in the arts than have  
been introduced to me.”  

Anonymous, Buffalo:  
"I don't think I've really been ex-  
posed to women artists, either in high  
school or college. I suppose it would  
be useful if more mention were made of  
women in all fields, not just the arts."  

Martha Peterson, Buffalo:  
"From high school, yes. I went to  
an all-girls Catholic high school. Es-  
pecially in literature, we were briefed  
on women writers. In my art history  
class, we were exposed to women artists  
and their contributions to the art  
world. From my own personal education,  
women as singers and songwriters have  
been one of the biggest contributors  
in that field in the past 20 years. I  
think we're going to be learning more  
about them in the future."  

Anonymous, Buffalo:  
"Back in my day, I don't think they  
made much of a point of women artists.  
Of course, I don't think there were as  
many women artists as there are today.  
But I believe the omission was not de-  
liberate, because there were so very  
few. You're making me think of the  
old days in Paris when everyone ral-  
lied around Gauguin, Cézanne, etc.  
There just weren't women artists.  
Weren't they encouraged?"  

Why?  

\  

etc.?  

_ Mary Hurley, Chicago:  
"But the more I decided what I wanted to  
learn about, I found that the classes  
were available. In high school, I went  
to a girls' school, but there was no  
emphasis on women writers. As I be-  
came an English major, the more my  
tastes developed and the more I began  
to seek out more women writers. At  
Cornell, there was a Women's Studies  
Department, but you couldn't get a  
major in it. Their classes drew to-  
gether different subjects, but they  
were outside of the other major cours-  
es. I now live in Chicago, where there  
are two women's bookstores, and they  
serve an educational purpose."  

Anonymous, Buffalo:  
"I happen to be a theater major,  
and so I deal with women in the arts  
all the time. I think it's a matter  
of choice because you take the courses  
that you want to take. At this point,  
I suppose most of the courses are much  
more male-oriented than female-orient-  
ed. But there are courses through  
Women's Studies College at U.B. which  
are based on the theme of women art-  
ists and writers. However, women are  
not as integrated in other courses.  
I’m now taking a course in French  
literature, and we have not read one  
woman writer in this course, nor did  
we in the other 4 or 5 courses I've  
taken in the past few years.”  

Jackie Grasso, Batavia:  
"As far as most fine artists are  
concerned, I didn't have much ex-  
posure at all, because I didn't take  
any music or art courses. The liter-  
ature course I did take didn't in-  
clude women writers. I just haven't  
been exposed to enough of any kind of  
artists to really know whether women  
have been slighted, whether they have  
not been given as much 'time' as they  
deserve."  

How do you feel about this?"  

Anonymous, Buffalo:  
"I've never taken any Women's Studies  
courses, but I took an English  
course at Alfred, and we did cover  
quite a few women writers, such as  
Flannery O'Connor and Doris Lessing.  
That was the only professor I had who  
really stressed women in the arts.  
As a result of that course, I found  
these writers to be interesting, and  
so I ended up reading more of their  
stories on my own. In another course,  
I just finished reading Pride and  
Prejudice, and Jane Austen was very  
innovative for her time. Because of  
this exposure, I plan to read more by  
her. Otherwise, I really haven't had  
that much exposure to women in the  
arts."
