TH  
HIPS HAVE IT  

"Under 18 Need Not Apply"  

by Joan Dickenson  

In a newspaper full of disasters  
I came upon an encouraging item.  
Hip pads are the newest thing  

in the 1986 Paris spring collections.  

The implications awe me. If the  
moguls have become disenchanted  
with the 14-year-old-boy look that  
has dominated mainstream fashion  
for 25 years, maybe there's hope.  
Can fat become the ideal? I see  
endless billowing vistas...  

I see girdles that add inches  
and curves. I see appetite-en-  
hancers sold in every drugstore  
while the Dexatrim company goes  
bankrupt. I see clinics offering  
make-up lessons: “Add pouch to  
your cheekbones! Simulate a second  
chin! A third chin!" I see a re-  
turn of the padded bra, along with  
the advent of padded undergarments,  
jeans with quilted linings in the  
thighs, buttocks, and stomach, and  
shirts with ruffles above the elbow  
to make the upper arm look fatter.  

I see women spending billions  
to fit the ideal of Paris, or Madi-  
son Avenue, while women like me  
need not spend a cent. Why change  
bulky perfection? Poor Bo Derek,  
having to go to an "accept your  
body as it is" workshop! I see  
Elizabeth Taylor, finally able to  
relax and eat what she wants.  

I imagine scenarios.  

Scene: Shopping at a department  
store for a black dress, I'm sur-  
rounded by racks and racks of coal-  
colored numbers. Cotton dresses.  
Silk gowns. Wool shirtwaists, from  
merino to cashmere. Linen floats.  
Short sleeves, long sleeves, cap  
sleeves, no sleeves. Knee length,  
floor length, mid-calf. With  
spangles and without, and at prices  

from $14.95 up. At the next rack  
over, there's a similar variety in  
navy blue...  

And all in my size.  

In walks a woman who is having  
trouble living up to the rounded  
ideal. She approaches the buxom  

saleswoman, who eyes her spare shape  

with pity!  

"Do you — I mean — I'm  

trying to find a black dress in size  

fourteen."  

"Size fourteen?" the woman says,  
frowning. "We only carry eighteen  
and up.”  

The customer looks wistfully at  
me, surrounded by racks of black.  
"I'm kind of a big fourteen," she  
says. “I could probably wear a  
sixteen...”  

"Why don't you try the 16-Minus  
store?" says the saleswoman. "It's  
over on the parkway.”  

"I went there," says Ms. Slim,  
“but everything they have is poly-  
ester. I like natural fabrics."  

"Well, I can show you the eight-  

teens," says the clerk. "A few of  
them are on the skimpy side. You  
could have one altered. Or you  
could go on a diet — twenty more  
pounds and you'd fit into a size  

eighteen."  

The woman sighs. "I know, I  
really should — but I just can't  
seem to gain weight, no matter how  
hard I try." The customer starts  
going through the eighteens, and  
later, as I pay for my purchase (a  
high-necked, clingy knit that makes  
me feel like Juno herself), I  
catch a glimpse of her in the  
three-way mirror. Swathed in a  
voluminous, capelike affair that  
makes her slight figure look even  
smaller, she is vainly trying to  
push her stomach out...  

Scene: Nancy, a skinny size  
ten, walks into the office after  
a week's vacation in Florida.  
"Nancy, you look terrific! What  
a great tan! You must have had  
a good time," says Della, who will  
never have to worry about her fig-  
ure. At 300 pounds, she is the  
acknowledged queen of the office  
gossip squad, "I bet you gained  
ten pounds," Della says.  

"Can you really tell? I'm so  
glad," says Nancy. "Yeah, I had  
a great time. All I did was lie  
around the pool and eat." She  
goes into the women's room,  

"Della, what are you talking  
about?" I ask. "Nancy hasn't  
gained an ounce — in fact, she  
looks thinner than before."  

Della winks. "A little flat-  
tery oils the wheels," she says.  

"I bet she did more than lie  
around,” says Eve, Della's closest  
challenger as Queen of the Typing  
Pool. “Did you see the underside  
of her arms? They didn't get that  
tan from just lying around. I bet-  
cha she's been water-skiing.”  

I see other scenes. I see  
groups like Undereaters Anonymous.  
I see a generation of women suffer-  
ing from slimmism. I see “thin  
pride" marches, featuring banners  
that say “Slender and Proud” and  
"Under what weight?" I see a new  
school of therapy formed to help  
women who can't force themselves  
to take a second helping (and the  
hardcore, who can't even take a  
first helping) of mashed potatoes.  
I see therapists doing "one bite  
at a time" workshops: "Roll that  
bite of brownie around in your  
mouth. How does it taste? Great!  
Now another small bite — that's  
okay, you'll learn to take bigger  
bites later — oh, wonderful! Now  
picture yourself at your ideal  
weight, 225. You're floating down  
a river, your belly puffed up like  
a balloon, and sexy people are  
lining the banks, calling, ‘There  
she goes...Isn't she beautiful?'”  

Scene: Three fat women are  
discussing a recent workshop given  
by a 110-pound woman. “Thin op-  
pression,” says one. "Now I've  
heard everything. Is this the new  
thing we have to be politically  
correct about?"  

"I know," her friend replies.  
"It's not as if she was born thin.  
She could eat more if she tried —  
it's just a question of will power.”  

"That's not fair," says the third  
woman, who is slightly thinner than  
her companions. "She can't help  
being thin — she has a deep-seated  
fear of being sexually attractive.  
We should help her, not add to her  
pain.”  

I see a generation of worried  
parents: "Dear, it's not healthful  
for you to be so thin. Please, for  
my sake, put some mayonnaise on your  
sandwich." I see TV commercials  
showing a 300-pound beauty driving  
off in a new Buick Hefty.  

I also see an enlightened medical  
profession. "I want you to gain  
thirty pounds," Doctor X tells a  
patient. "I realize you have to  
force yourself to eat, but you really  
must do it. At your current weight,  
you'd be dead in ten years from  
nerve burn-out. You have to learn  
to take it easy. When you feel the  
urge to jog, call me...or if you  
must go out, walk, don't run. Ex-  
ercise is okay in moderation, but  
after you're through, be sure and  
make yourself an ice cream soda."  

I see 250-pound cheerleaders  
egging on the Dallas Cowboys. I  
see women weeping because they  
missed the squad...by only five  
pounds! Poor skinny things!  

From my position as an elder,  
an old-timer who was fat before  
the hip-pad revolution, I'll con-  
sole them. "Never mind, there's  
always tomorrow. Eat a hot fudge  
sundae after every meal and you'll  
see a drastic improvement.  

"And if you really work at it,”  
I'll tell them, “someday you can  
be as fat as me."
