was happy that the resolution concerning  
Violence Against Women was passed.  
It supports a woman's right to fight  
back and defend herself and her children  
against an abusive relative. In  
particular, it supports Leslie Anne  
Emick's action to defend herself and  
children, and provides Buffalo NOW with  
national support.  

The next day was the Presidential  
Forum at which 6 Democratic presidential  
candidates spoke: Mondale,  
Cranston, McGovern, Hart, Hollings and  
Glenn. It was an indication of NOW's  
political growth that the conference  
attracted the attention and support  
of these candidates. Judy asked each  
if he would consider choosing a woman  
vice-president; each answered yes.  
They are all good on the traditional  
feminist issues (E.R.A., equal pay and  
comparable worth, abortion rights).  
Where they disagreed was on peace issues:  
McGovern to the extreme left (he  
was the only candidate to call for a  
reduction in the military budget),  
ranging to Hollings at the right (he  
wants to rebuild our conventional forces).  
Glenn's gaffe concerning the  
failure of the E.R.A. has been well  
publicized, but I have to give him  
credit for a wonderful talk - he has  
a great speech-writer!  

We also heard from more women politicians -  
Margie Hendrickson from Oregon (who may run  
against anti-abortion Mark Hatfield), and  
Sandra Locke (West Virginia State Senator)  
who stated, in response to Glenn,  
"We did not loaf in fighting for the E.R.A.!",  
and got a big round of applause.  

The second plenary sessions dealt  
with the resolutions presented by the  
Hearings sessions, petitions signed  
by 250 delegates, and the National  
Board. 15 were passed (see last issue  
of C.G.), several of which I am particularly  
proud: Medicaid funding and  
Violence Against Women, resolutions  
in support of the Nuclear Freeze and  
Gay and Lesbian Rights, and a resolution  
against Tuition Tax Credits. The  
importance of these resolutions cannot  
be underestimated: they help NOW attract  
new members, they educate and  
motivate present members, and they allow  
us to work in coalitions with other  
groups who share common goals. Most  
importantly to me, they provide a basis  
for us to act progressively in our  
communities by giving a sense of how  
our organization feels about issues.  

The conference was an invaluable experience  
for me as a community activist.  
It is a powerful feeling to have my beliefs  
shared by so many other women and  
men. It was such an emotional event, I  
spent most of the time with a lump in  
my throat and watery eyes! Although we  
did not agree on everything, the spirit  
of cooperative debate prevailed. I  
left with the feeling that women can  
make the difference; we will finally  
win our birthright of legal equality  
by bringing women's suffrage finally  
to fruition by voting out our enemies  
(i.e. Reagan) and voting in feminist  
women and men who will support our  
issues. Once we have the laws and  
their enforcement on our side, then  
we can start to deal with changing  
people's hearts and minds so that true  
equality between the sexes will become  
a reality.

A Mother Laments  

-Anonymous  

Today my son acknowledged my  
presence by lightly squeezing my hand  
with three fingers and lifting his  
head slightly for my kiss. Practically  
three weeks have passed  
since he was struck by a drunk driver.  

He has been deeply comatose. He is  
strong and his body works hard for  
him. His hearing is now normal.  

He is afraid. The original faint  
and now profound lines of anxiety  
on his face are unmistakable. His  
arms are often drawn tightly to his  
chest, and his hands tremble.  

We who love and stroke and kiss  
him are also afraid. We are told,  
for example, that he is almost  
certainly blind. We see his body  
grow smaller in the bed, day by  
day, from loss of weight, see his  
muscles pit from atrophy, see  
feet drop at the ankles. We bring  
our strength and love to him and  
work with him toward recuperation.  
It may be six to nine weeks before  
we know if he will again become  
aware, if he will be able to break  
out of himself, where he is  
forcibly confined.  

How many mothers have faced up  
to these circumstances, I don't  
know. Since the accident, I've  
learned how many friends and  
acquaintances I have. My daughters  
and I have met with a representative  
from the National Brain Injury  
Foundation, established by  
family members who know what this  
experience, "the silent epidemic",  
is like, and who support others  
in overcoming it. I've learned  
about Mothers Against Drunk Drivers  
(MADD), a pressure group founded  
to achieve and implement laws that  
more adequately deter and punish  
criminals who wreak this havoc.  

My mother and 24-year-old daughter  
are seeking to join this group. I  
will be doing this as well.  

We have sometimes had to cope  
with pessimistic doctors, unwilling  
to extend even hope and otherwise  
uncommunicative, although hope is  
warranted and information sharing,  
appropriate. We have also had to  
cope with sometimes callous nurses,  
who have written off my son in  
their own traumatization from constant  
contact with these circumstances and doctors.  
We and others have confronted these  
individuals about their unprofessional conduct.  
Sometimes they modify it. The  
great preponderance of nurses care  
beautifully for my son, as well as  
for us, involve us in his care,  
call him by name, tell him in advance  
what they are doing, tend to  
his needs meticulously, gently  
and respectfully, renewing our  
hopes as they do so. It sometimes  
seems a tenuous balance, with, on  
the one hand, the doctor who demonstrated  
for a group of residents the  
innovative, molded plastic splints  
made to fit my son's arms and legs,  
to prevent muscle atrophy, and  
failed to use the stockinettes and  
support hose under them that protect  
his skin from stress and sores,  
who left the skin of two of  
his arms and one leg pinched in  
the seams where the plastic shells  
clamp shut, and failed to have them  
removed after two hours, as required.  
One nurse, on the other hand,  
asked to special duty my son  
(several have, in fact), and literally  
memorized every square inch of  
his body to be prepared for changes,  
visits him on her days off and pops  
in briefly when assigned to another  
patient. Her own son is hospitalized  
in an adjoining facility. She  
finds time as well for a teen-aged  
foster daughter who was sexually  
abused in a former home. This  
woman once coaxed a tiny smile  
from my son's lips.  

My son, a 19-year-old honors  
student at a major urban university,  
until recently shared an  
apartment with his 20-year-old  
sister, also a fine student. She  
reached adulthood the night of the  
accident. These two are but 14  
months apart in age and enjoy a  
lifelong, healthy and caring  
relationship. She has virtually never  
left his side, joins in his care  
with her nurse's aide skills,  
sings to him "Christopher Robin,"  
and bears up courageously under  
her own pain. I too sing, an old  
Peter, Paul and Mary tune, "and if  
you take my hand my son, all will  
be well when the day is done."  

My son's eldest sister, five years  
his senior, has moved to the city  
in which he is hospitalized, to  
stay with him and to keep their  
sister from loneliness. This  
experience is indeed a lonely one.  
My son's father is a surgeon. We  
are divorced, and united in our  
son's care. This is his father's  
hospital.  

Today, a get well card arrived  
from the 33-year-old white male  
who devastated my son--perhaps,  
on his lawyer’s advice, to establish  
remorse prior to trial and  
sentencing. He will receive an  
automatic jail sentence and will  
probably serve about one year.  
Last week this man’s wife called.  

We are angry beyond belief at this  
man's irresponsibility, that he  
committed this heinous crime.  
Twice over the legally permissible  
level of drunkenness, with ten  
drinks operating full force on him,  
he never braked his 1967 Cadillac,  
which bent the Corvette driven by  
my son into a "v". My son's father  
lent him the car for the evening,  
to reward him for his academic  
performance. My son spent that  
evening with his best friend and  
his best friend's parents, in  
their home. During the collision,  
in which the Cadillac smashed into  
the driver's door of the Corvette,  
the steering wheel and the back of  
the driver's seat were ground within  
three inches of each other.  

U.S. built cars will not sustain  
or absorb such a collision.  
Fortunately, in this case, my son  
was not wearing a seat belt, was  
thrown free of the driver's seat  
and hence, not crushed. He stayed  
in the car. One hour and 45 minutes  
elapsed before he could be removed  
from it. One of the four witnesses  
to the accident had a sister involved  
in a similar accident, with similar  
results, and knew exactly what had  
happened and exactly what to do.  
The accident occurred five blocks  
from the house we once occupied as a family;  
across from the field on which my  
son once played Little League  
baseball.  

My son's friends are constant  
and caring. They visit him daily,  
keep vigil by the hours. After two  
of my son's friends were married  
last Saturday afternoon, they came  
to his room with the entire wedding  
party of eight. Including my  
son's youngest sister and her  
intended, my son's best friend,  
these eight young people stood in  
their beautiful gowns and tuxedos,  
holding hands around his bed and  
talking to him for an hour. The  
bride left him her wreath of  
daisies and baby's breath, and the  
groom, his boutonniere. One of  
these friends was once himself in  
a coma, for three days, after a  
motorcycle accident, and has recovered  
to his usual self. He sustains us  
and gives us courage through his presence.  

We are individually and collectively  
empowered by our own friends, who  
visit, call, write, bring food,  
run errands, invite us into their  
homes and help reduce the pressure  
on us. My friends in Buffalo have  
visited my son and me in the city  
in which he is hospitalized, have  
driven me back and forth, performed  
numerous services for us all, and  
have been kindly and gently disposed.  
We have benefited from people's  
prayers and loving concentration,  
even from people we did not know.  
As I was carefully driven by a friend  
to this city on the night of the  
accident, in fear and in despair  
for I did not know if my child  
would be alive when I arrived, a  
woman operating a service station  
at which we stopped called her  
prayer chain, carefully spelling  
my son's name to her contact. My  
work colleagues are generous with  
countless ways. One brought me  
breakfast on my first day back.  
Because many are my son's age, I  
rejoice in their vitality, as I do  
with my son's and daughters' friends.  
I am always most hopeful with these  
young people.  

I am also in shock, short of  
short-term memory, at times  
intellectually confused, and capable  
of only brief spurts of emotion.  
Foremost among these emotions are  
hope, grief, anger and fear. I  
know I have adequate strength for  
the days of waiting ahead and the  
reality of this incomprehensible  
situation. As has always been the  
case, I accept my son for himself.  
All of us as human beings present  
ourselves differently at different  
life stages. My son is presenting  
himself in a certain way--presently  
awake but not aware. Now as always,  
I appreciate him for the personable  
individual he is. I am anguished  
by his suffering, and anticipate  
his continued, lifelong recuperation.  
I will be there for him, as  
we have been for each other in the  
past. Clearly, our lives will  
never again be the same. I am  
heartsick about this and simultaneously  
grateful for the opportunities presented.
