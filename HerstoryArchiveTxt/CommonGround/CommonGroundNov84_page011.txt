TEN DAYS

I look back two and one half  
years ago when I first joined WAND  
and remember the number of times  
I mentioned we should go to the  

Soviet Union to talk with women there.  

This summer I had the honor and  
privilege to represent WAND in such  
a venture, and it will always be an  
experience I will hold deep in my  
heart and mind.  

Ten men and women from a number of  
different Peace organizations were  
invited by the Council of American-  
Soviet Friendship (U.S.A.) and the  
Council of Youth Organizations of the  
U.S.S.R. to participate in a Peace  
Conference with an equal number of  
Soviet citizens. Our Soviet counter-  
parts were graduate students, econ-  

omists, teachers, lawyers, researchers  

and a manager of a state farm. This  
was the first time such a  
conference has taken place and the hope is that  

it will continue in 1986 in the United  

States.  

I found myself torn between wanting  

to take part in the conference, want-  
ing to see the country and wanting to  
talk individually with our Soviet  
friends. Unfortunately, ten days  

was much too short a time. In that  
time, however, we experienced a mix-  
ture of all...each of which proved  

to be equally important.  

My interaction with the people is  
the one experience that stands out  
now that I am home. I found the  
Soviets an extremely warm, friendly,  
concerned group of people. I never  
realized how devastating war could be  
until I went to the Soviet Union.  
Everyone was affected by World War II  
and it's something that they contin-  
ually talk about. I also observed  

located on each campus. Each station  
is manned by at least one pair of  
ARTF volunteers identified by I.D.  
tags.  

“The volunteers will walk anyone  
to any place on campus," Kucera said.  
Van services are run only on the  
Main Street campus, [and will drive]  
passengers from pick-up locations  

to any destination within 1 1/2  
miles of the Main Street Campus.  

A network of UCARE (University  
Community Against Rape Experiences)  
houses has been established by  
ARTF. All of the UCARE houses are  
located within 1 1/2 mile radius of  
the Main Street Campus.  

"All of the participating house-  
holds undergo a careful interview  
before they are accepted," Kucera  
said.  

All UCARE safe-houses are open to  
any student who has any kind of prob-  
lem.  

The houses are identified by a  
big sign in the front window," Kucera  
said.  

All ARTF programs require the  
efforts of volunteers. Kucera urges  
anyone interested to go to the ARTF  
office at 67-S Harriman Hall.  

"It only takes four hours of your  
time a week to help," Kucera said.

IN THE SOVIET UNION  

By Eileen Giarraffa  

an extreme sense of responsibility  
among the Soviets. They actively  
take part in their system, which  
they call a democratic system. From  
a very early age they learn how to be  
a part of the system, and the rights  
of a citizen to participate in the  
system.  

I found them very concerned with  
how the Americans perceived them.  
They are very proud of their country  
and their people and are upset about  
the image some have of them. They  
saw great hope in changing this image  
by the possibility of continued ex-  
changes among farmers, teachers,  
doctors, scientists and people such  
as ourselves.  

I became very close with five of  
our counterparts and I would like to  
give you the feeling I had about  
two of these people.  

Olga was the first Soviet I met.  
She was our translator and travelled  
with us. Olga is a 23 year old  
English student and a member of  
the Communist Party. She was only  
invited as a translator, but she  
became a real part of the conference,  
and during our talks I realized that  
she was learning as much as any of  
us. I will never forget my good-byes  
to Olga and the warmth she expressed.  

Bakti first introduced himself to  
me at the airport in Moscow where we  
met to fly to Baku where the confer-  
ence was being held. My immediate  
impression of Bakti was that he was  
a good, wholesome, old-fashioned guy.  
He immediately pulled out pictures of  
his family and explained with great  
pride each member of the family. His  
last picture was one of his grand-  
father who had served and died in W.W.  
II. He never knew his grandfather,  
but he was so proud of him and said  
that his grandfather's picture was  
his most important possession.  

Bakti was very interested in my  
occupation (teaching physical educa-  
tion to handicapped children) and I  
spent many hours explaining my program  
and the type of training I received.  
The one thing that I will always re-  
member of Bakti is the sight of him  
standing and waiting for us at the  
train station. Bakti was so excited  

about his experience with the "Amer-  
icans" that he asked to go to Lenin-  
grad with us. We had a stopover in  

Moscow before we left for Leningrad,  

during which time Bakti went home and told  
his mother all about us. She turned  
all sorts of good things for us to  

on the train to Leningrad.  

I really remember meeting Bakti  
and Olga again along with Maya, Marina.  

Will this world survive long enough  
for another exchange? The future is  
in all our hands.
