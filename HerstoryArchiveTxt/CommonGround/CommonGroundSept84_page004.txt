SENECA PEACE CAMP  
GOING UNDER THE GATE  

by Ruth Geller  

The Seneca Army Depot in Romulus,  
New York is an eerie place: seven-  
teen miles of chain link fence topped  
by barbed wire. Inside are a myriad  
of buildings, some nice duplex  
houses complete with back yard  
swings, and neutron bombs, the kind  
that destroy life more than property.  
All of this is plunk in the middle  
of New York's farmlands.  

In October 1983 a coalition of  
peace groups called for a blockade  
of the Depot gates to protest the  
presence of these bombs, and the  

transshipment of the Cruise Missiles  
to Europe, where they would be de-  
ployed. The blockade would be a  
non-violent civil disobedience, and  
the blockaders would be risking  
arrest. The organizers stipulated  
that anyone blockading must be a  
member of an Affinity Group, and  
must have taken part in a day-long  
training session in non-violence.  

In early October a meeting was  
held at the Western New York Peace  
Center for interested people. I  
was interested but apprehensive,  
having been raised with an under-  
standing of the power governments  
can wield, and how certain political  
involvement can suddenly turn un-  
fashionable and even dangerous.  

“We met one Saturday in a church  
basement. We were thirteen in all:  
six men, seven women, two of them  
pregnant. We ranged in age from  
twenty-three to sixty-five (I am  
thirty-eight); all of us white  
people of various ethnicities. All,  
except me, were Christian, many  
involved in peace work because of  
strong religious convictions.  

Among us there were one priest and  
one former priest.  

I had not looked forward to the  
training, but I enjoyed it. We  
learned some history of the Depot,  
and of the nearby Women's Peace  
Encampment. We learned the rules of  
non-violent civil disobedience (no  
physical or verbal abuse to anyone,  
no property destruction, no activity  
such as running that might cause a  
panic); and we took part in role  
playing to see our reactions to  
different situations. We discussed  
the possible consequences of arrest,  
and how we felt about it. We dis-  

cussed whether or not to give our  
real names if arrested. Some felt  
it was a matter of conscience to  
stand up and be counted, as it were.  
But I decided to aim for anonymity!  
It mattered that someone stood up,  
I felt; it didn't matter who.  

We chose a name for ourselves:  
Help Wanted, and decided who would  
be Support People, those not risking  
arrest, but responsible for those  
arrested. We met one more time to  
make final plans, and on the twenty-  
third of October we drove in several  
cars to Romulus.  

That evening we met with the  
other affinity groups in a large,  
barn-like building to get last—  
minute information, sing songs, and  
find out about ourselves: who had  
come the farthest, someone from  
Australia; the youngest, sixteen;  
the oldest, eighty; and how many  
we were: over 400. Each bit of  
information was met with cheers,  
and we left in high spirits.  

Our Affinity Group stayed that  
night in an old house on the prop-  
erty of a family sympathetic to our  
action. People found places on  
mattresses or couches, but I decided  
to sleep on the porch, on a creaky  
old porch glider. Deciding to sleep  
was as far as it went. I hardly  
slept at all.  

The night was too beautiful:  
just like an October night in the  
country! A kitten that lived on  
the farm came up to investigate the  
big lump on the porch swing, and  
crawled into my sleeping bag. It  
bit at my fingers to provoke me  
into play; then began to purr,  
kneading the fleshy parts of my  
body, of which there are many.  
Finally, it fell asleep against the  
back of my neck. I closed my eyes,  
hoping I wouldn't get fleas.

But still I couldn't  
sleep; the night felt too prous;  
I kept thinking of the weapons stored  
not thirty miles away! I was too  
brimful of hope and despair, and I  
couldn't help but cry at what might  
be lost forever.  

I didn't know how much time had  
passed; I had forgotten to wear a  
watch. Finally I gave up, went  
inside, and got two Dramamine tablets  
(my motion-sickness medicine) from  
my sleeping bag. Back outside I  
zipped myself and the kitten into  
the sleeping bag, and fell asleep.  

I learned later that I'd slept only  
20 minutes before being awakened and  
told it was time to leave.  

It was still dark when we arrived  
at the Depot's Main Gate. The  
counter-demonstrators were there with  
their American flags and foul mouths.  
We linked hands, singing, and  
crossed the road. There were about  

100 blockaders, and a slew of TV  

cameras, including one from a Japan-  
ese TV station. We stood there only  
a short time before we learned that  
the next gate down was without block-  
aders, and cars and trucks were  
getting through. After a quick con-  
ference, we decided to move.  

As we hurried toward the gate I  
saw a group of soldiers on the other  
side and imagined a nasty scene:  
the vehicles trying to pass us, the  
soldiers dragging us off. But they  
seemed as anxious as we to avoid a  
confrontation: they simply closed  
the gate and locked it.  

We stood on one side, they on  
the other. We'd talked during our  
training about how to respond to  

them, but once we were actually here,  
it was faintly embarrassing, like  
strangers stuck in an elevator,  

trying to look everywhere but each  
other's eyes.  

We stayed that way for some time.  
We chatted among ourselves, sang,  
told jokes. It was cold and damp  
and foggy; and as usual, I hadn't  
dressed warmly enough. I was wear-  
ing long johns, corduroy jeans, a  
jersey shirt, bulky sweater,  
and down vest, but only one pair of  
socks, and sneakers that were al-  
ready wet. In my knapsack was an  
orange nylon parka, but at first I  
refrained from wearing it for I  
knew it would make me look like the  
Great Pumpkin. After a while, how-  
ever, I didn't care any more, and  
pulled it over my head. On the  
other side of the gate, the soldiers  
in their skimpy uniforms shuffled  
their feet and maintained stoic  
masks. Not me. I was freezing my  
ass off and didn't care who knew it.  
I complained, jumped around, and  
flapped my arms like a deranged  
chicken.  

By this time we had decided to  
try and make contact with the soldiers.  
This was not easy; by not only their  
uniforms, weapons, and physical  
position they were clearly defined  
as being on the other side, but by  
their attitudes, too. They were  
disdainful, superior, and tried  
their best to act as if we were  
invisible. They joked among them-  
selves, too. At one point we heard  
a noise, and a soldier quipped, “oops,  
there goes Europe," and the others  
laughed. Nevertheless, we stood at  
the Gate, and one by one, made state-  
ments.  

Several of my Affinity Group began  
their statements with: "I am a  
Christian, and I believe..." I won-  
dered with a touch of impishness  
(but also annoyance) what the various  
reactions would be if I began my  
statement with: "I am a Jew, and I  
believe..." But I wasn't sure what  
I believed; and besides, there was  
no other Jew there who would automa-  
tically understand the humor of  
making that statement in such a situ-  
ation, and what it took to make it.  

That statement needed the edge  
of ironic glances; without them it  
would be incomplete.  

I don't remember all that I said.  
I know that I spoke from my heart,  
and tried to get the soldiers to  
meet my eyes. I said that we were  
people just like them, with jobs  
and families and worries. We had  
things we loved to do and things  
that were a pain, and it took a lot  
for us to leave our lives and come  
out here and stand in front of this  
Gate. "We're not hippies or weirdos  
or nuts," I said. "We're people,  
just like you."  

One of the soldiers, a young man,  
white, turned and muttered, “I doubt  
it."  

"We are alike," I insisted, fixing  
my eyes on him. “We're more alike  
than you think."  

He looked away from me, obviously  
uncomfortable, and obviously trying  
to hide it. He did not want to be  
like me. It was too threatening.  

He wanted to be where he was: on  
the side of the powerful. Safe.  

Our statements did establish a  
minimum amount of contact, and we  
talked back and forth for the next  
several hours. I talked mostly to  
a man older than the rest, dressed  
in a different uniform. I was drawn  
to him, and wisecracked to him,  
teasing him about his refusal to  
respond to me until he finally did.  
I learned later that he was from the  
Department of Defense.  

Throughout our time in front of  
the Gate, organizers had periodically  
come around to inform us about the  
blockade in general. Apparently it  
was a success. The blockaders at  
the Women's Gate had gone over the  
fence long ago, and others had begun  
to do the same.  

It had become clear that we  

would not be arrested as blockaders,  
but only if we went over the fence.  
We huddled in a tight circle and  
discussed our alternatives which  
seemed to be either going over or  
going home. As we stood there a  
group of counter-demonstrators  
marched down the road: men carrying  
American flags, Bibles, and signs.  
Now it was my turn to feel threat-  
ened. People telling me I am damned  
to hell unless I change my sinful  
pagan ways have always made me  
uncomfortable. Several of the  
Affinity Group wanted to engage  
them in conversation but we agreed  
as a whole not to do so, and went  
on discussing our alternatives.  

Four people said that they  
would go over, or in our case, go  
under, for the fence, topped with  
barbed wire, seemed too imposing to  
scale. For those of us who stayed  
on the other side, the arrest of the  
first four was strangely moving.  

But after they were gone, the day  
seemed colder and more interminable,  
and the ranks in front of the Gate  
had thinned considerably. The woman  
in her first trimester of pregnancy  
had been ill all day, and finally  
went home. Several people were  
taking turns walking to a nearby  
diner. It was nice being in the  
diner, but back at the fence, I  
knew I had to decide what to do.  

I was of two distinct, diametri-  
cally opposed opinions. "I only came  
to blockade," I reminded myself  
somewhat defensively. "I risked  
arrest. There's no sense in pushing  
it."  

“But if you can do more," I  
countered, “if you can make a  
stronger statement...You're here,  
now. You might not get this chance  
again."  

But it looked so bleak and fore-  
boding inside that fence, like a  
place one might enter, but never  
get out.  

I was sitting on someone's sleeping  
bag next to Esther, a woman of fifty.  

I knew she wanted to go under, and I  
wouldn't meet her eyes. Finally she  
poked me. "Come on," she said, ges-  
turing with her head toward the Gate.  
“Let's go."  

“I don't know,  
I can't decide.”  

She shrugged, and I went on thinking.  
After a while I turned to look at the  
Gate, at the space under which I would  
have to crawl. It was all very well  
for the others, I thought rather peev-  
ishly, they were skinny. I considered  
my generously endowed body; and thought,  
"If my boobs got stuck, I'd die of  
embarrassment."  

I sighed, and looked at Esther with  
what must have been an expression of  
helpless frustration. "I don't know  
what to do," I complained.  

She nodded, then said: "The only  
thing I'm worried about is if I'll fit."  

My mouth dropped open, and I laughed  
aloud. “That's it," I said, slapping  
my hand on my leg. "That decides it."  
I told her what I'd been thinking, and  
she laughed along with me. “Oh, defin-  
itely," she said, "that decides it,”  
and we stood up and walked to the Gate.  

We managed to slip under, were  
cuffed and taken to the processing  
area. Going under for us was casual:  
we laughed, and chatted with the sol-  
diers.  

The mood changed abruptly, however,  
as the bus approached the processing  
area. Beside a one story white clap-  
board building was an area the size of  
a small football field, composed of  
pens made of twelve foot high chain  
link fencing. On one side of the  
building the men were caged, and on the  
other, the women. It was mid-afternoon,  
and many of the women had been standing  
in the unsheltered cold since early  
morning. They were demanding to be  
processed. But for some reason, our  
group—a mixed group—was processed  
first.  

Most of our Affinity Group had come  
under by then. We were lined up and  
taken into the building where we were  
separated, photographed, searched,  
questioned, and given Ban and Bar  
letters, all of this with assembly  
line precision by bored military  
personnel.  

It had been possible to make some  
contact with the personnel by the Gate,  
and even outside by the pens. But in-  
side the building it was impossible.  

No one would make small talk or meet  
my eyes. There was a strong sense  
that everything we did was under obser-  
vation.  

These soldiers were men and women,  
many of them people of color, who were  
here for primarily economic reasons.  
They couldn't get jobs, and they'd  
joined the Army. They had been trained  
to be soldiers, trained not only to  
physically perform certain tasks, but  
trained emotionally: to follow orders  
and not to ask questions, or offer to  
take responsibility for their actions.  
Emotionally they had distanced them-  
selves from us, learned to think of us  
as not real. Their economic need cou-  
pled with that training was a powerful  
combination, one essential to the func-  
tioning of a repressive society. They  
had, I supposed, been ordered to be  
polite to us. They would have been  
just as efficient, I was sure, follow-  
ing orders of a more deadly kind.  

Suddenly and without warning, in  
the midst of processing, I seemed to  
be in another time and another place.  
It was as though I'd been transported,  
or as though I was experiencing differ-  
ent histories simultaneously. I  
couldn't seem to ground myself in my  
own reality. I tried to reassure my-  
self by concentrating on the efficient,  
almost civilized atmosphere of people  
in an office; but it struck me that the  
atmosphere was an illusion, and that  
it was precisely such bureaucracies  
that enabled wars to happen, created  

situations in which people could be  
tortured and murdered.  

My reality seemed to expand even  
more: this was not only Nazi Germany,  
but Chile, El Salvador, an America of  
the future. Then I was angry, for I  
knew that this processing was meant to  
frighten me, to demonstrate the poten-
