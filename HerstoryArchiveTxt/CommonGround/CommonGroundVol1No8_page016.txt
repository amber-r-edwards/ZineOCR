Buffalo: Big Town For  
Small Presses  

[This is the last in a series of articles  

on the small presses in Western New York.  
In the first article, (CG Jan. '83), we  
described what small presses are, how  
they operate and some of the problems  
they face in order to keep running. We  
also began an enumeration of the var-  
ious presses that have been started in  
the area since the late 1960's, describ-  
ing a little of their background and  
variety of materials they produce. The  
second installment continued the des-  
cription of presses, which is completed  
in Part III.]  

* Serendipity Arts Unlimited - this  
press was begun in 1975 by Jimmie  
Canfield of Earth's Daughters, and  
Nancy Barnes, both in the English  
Department at ECC City campus. The  
press is part of a larger literary  
concept whose aim is to "support, in  
life, art where we find it". SAU has  
sponsored a series of European-style  
Salons where writers and artists, by  
invitation, can share their most re-  
cent work “in a witty, friendly at-  
mosphere". In 1979, 20 salon poems  
were illustrated, framed, and organ-  
ized into an exhibit entitled, “The  
Poem Finds Its Place”. The exhibit  
was shown in a number of public places  
around the city and is still available  
upon request. Serendipity Press is  
unique in being a press that is run  
for profit. It pays its authors 13%  
of the proceeds from the sale of  
their books and has so far issued  
three chapbooks by local women wri-  
ters. The press aims to make each  
book a work of art, tries to capture  

cooperation and input into the content and design of  
the publication.  

In addition to her involvement in  
Earth's Daughters and Serendipity, Ms.  
Canfield has become a mentor for many  
aspiring writers both in workshops  
and in her teaching. She is especially  
sensitive to the needs of women who  
want to write and has helped her stu-  
dents at ECC produce two issues of a  
campus literary magazine, City (1975)  
and City Sampler (1982). They are  
available from the English Department  
at the City Campus (842-2770).  

* A Room of Our Own - this journal  
was first published in 1976 by the  
Women's Writing Workshop at SUNYAB  
(Common Ground, Jan/83). The intent  
of the journal, which comes out each  
May, is to provide a forum for the  
work of as many women writers as pos-  
sible. Membership in the workshop is  
not necessary. The editorial board  
changes from year to year and works  
as a collective drawn from members of  
the workshop and its instructors. The  
editors specifically look for writing  
which shows an inventive or original  
use of language while at the same  
time presents positive images of women.  

* Textile Bridge Press - in 1977,  
local jazz poet Joy Walsh turned her  
longtime interest in Jack Kerouac into  
the Moody Street Irregulars: A Jack  
Kerouac Newsletter, the purpose of  
which is to allow Kerouac fans to  
“celebrate the man, his books, his  
friends and his times." From the  
beginning, Moody Street "took off  
like a bat out of hell", gaining sub-  
scriptions from all over the world.  
The following year, Walsh began  
Textile Bridge Press. TBP, named af-  
ter a bridge in Kerouac's birthplace  
of Lowell, Mass., is an extension of  
Walsh's preoccupation with Kerouac.  
A press that seems exceedingly ener-  
getic, TBP has already turned out many  
publications in the form of broadsides  
and chapbooks by authors "connected to  
the Kerouac thing” which, according to  
Walsh, means "holy-minded good feel-  
ings and clear visions." Many other  
publications are in the works, includ-  
ing a 120-page illustrated book of  
fiction and an anthology of Japanese  
poets in translation. Walsh, whose  
own work has been published “all over  
the globe”, sees the future direction  
of TBP as moving out more into the  
global community and publishing in  
other languages, especially French  
Canadian.  

Part II  

The year 1979 saw the start of yet  
another local press, two little maga-  
zines and a newspaper:  

* Orchard Press - this press was  
started by Sheryl Robbins when she  
learned how to run an old letterpress  
machine left to her friends. She  
has since acquired two more letter-  
presses and several photo offset  
machines. She considers herself more a  
printer than a publisher and is the  
only woman in the area to run a hand-  
set press. Orchard Press contracts  
printing work from other small pres-  
ses as well as doing commercial work  
for the general public. As a publi-  
sher, the Press specializes in poem  
postcards by local poets.  

With the Albright-Knox, Orchard  
Press recently co-sponsored a poetry  
contest on the theme “Poems Inspired  
by Art in The Albright Knox Art Gal-  
lery". Eleven of the poems submitted  
were hand-set by Ms. Robbins as indi-  
vidual broadsides in a special lim-  
ited edition of 100. The sets are  
available from the Gallery Bookstore  
for $10.00.  

* Top Story - this is the only little  
magazine in the area devoted exclus-  
ively to works of fiction. Top Story  
grew out of the Fiction Diction read-  
ing series sponsored by Hallwalls and  
is edited by Ann Turyn, the former co-  
ordinator of the series. Turyn looks  
for emerging artists whose work is  
both high quality and experimental.  
Issues are published in chapbook for-  
mat and each writer has a great deal  
of control over the design and con-  
tent of the book. The texts are often  
profusely illustrated. Authors are  

not a feminist publication per se,  
all 13 writers published to date have  
been women.  

* Terra Poetica - is a multi-lingual  
magazine of poetry published by SUNYAB's  
Department of Modern Languages. It is  
printed both in the original language  
of the writer and in translation, and  
poetry in western as well as non-western  
languages is invited. Robin Willoughby  
of Earth's Daughters is French Language  
editor and also works on various pro-  
duction tasks.  

* Alternative Press - formerly  
named The Other One, this news-  
paper was started at SUNYAB in 1979  
and conceived as a community paper.  
It is run by a collective, with  
approximately 30 students participating  
in its production. 12,000 copies  
are printed weekly and distributed  
free on campus. Alternative Press  

is open to anyone from the community  
who wishes to contribute labor or sub-  
mit articles or poetry. Nancy  
Parisi is poetry editor.  

* Imp Press - this press got its  
start in 1980 when it published Ruth  
Geller's novel, Seed of a Woman. A  
non-local press had been slated to  
publish Seed, but then broke its con-  
tract; Ms. Geller‘s response was to  
publish the book herself. Thus, Imp  
was born for a very specific and lim-  
ited end. It subsequently published  
Geller's book of short stories, Pic-  
tures from the Past in 1981, but right  
now is in limbo with no plans for  

PAGE COMMON GROUND APRIL 1983  

future publications. Ms. Geller has  
recently completed her second novel,  
Triangles, which has been submitted  
to several other publishers.  

* Arachne - according to Kathy Tenpas,  
one of the editors of Arachne: hang-  
ing by a thread, this poetry publica-  
tion began "as an expression of ex-  
treme frustration" at the difficult-  
ies she and Beth Baker Bowers, the  
original co-editor, were having get-  
ting published. The idea grew in the  
fall of 1979 and the first issue ap-  
peared in the winter of 1980. The  
seed money for the project came from  
individual artist grants both women  
received from the Chautauqua County  
Artists Association for a series of  
readings and workshops. Finding suf-  
ficient funds to continue publishing  
has been a never-ending problem.  

Most of the work published has come  
from the area, but not exclusively so.  
At present Arachne is in a state of  
flux in terms of both format and fut-  
ure direction. It began as a mimeo-  
graphed fold-over, but is now in chap-  
book form. Plans for the future in-  
clude the possibility of adding graph-  
ics and photographs, including fiction  
as well as poetry, and increasing the  
length of each issue.  

* Black Mountain II Review - in 1980,  
SUNYAB's College changed its name to  
Black Mountain College II to better  
reflect its link to the revolutionary  
ideas and goals of the original college  
that existed in North Carolina from  

1933 to 1956. The college is devoted  

to the arts and published its first  
issue of the Review in spring, 1981. The Review is  
a literary-arts publication which is  

student-run and edited by Stephanie  
Wiseman. It is a large format, glossy  
magazine that includes poetry, short  
fiction, artwork, photography and  
articles on all aspects of the arts. The  
Review prints 1000 copies and has al-  
ready gained national attention for  
both the quality of its contents and  
its professional appearance.  

* Swift Kick - Robin Willoughby, who  
works on Earth's Daughters and Terra  
Poetica, in addition to being an active  
poet and rubber stamp artist, decided  
to start her own press in 1981. Swift  
Kick is by far the most adventurous  
press in WNY, with the avowed intent  
of publishing items of quality which,  
because they are "off-the-wall", vio-  
lent in theme, or otherwise "strange",  
would not get published anywhere else.  
SK has three primary projects going  

on at once (in addition to putting  

out 2 occasional postcards): a maga-  
zine called Swift Kick, the first 3  
issues of which appeared simultaneously  
around Christmas, 1982 and which con-  
tains "things that defy description";  
crafted editions of work  
that are made-to-order, such as a  
single copy hand-made book in honor of  
Bonnie Johnson, and a hand-set limited  
edition of a poem printed on hand-  
made paper as a memoriam to the com-  
poser Margaret Rogers; and, thirdly,  
the Poetry on the Buses exhibit. The  
latter, funded by grants from ADS and  
NYSCA, is a series of poems selected  
from an open competition which are  
printed with illustrations on large  
posters and displayed on NFT buses  
(one poem a month, for 8 consecutive  
months, with 100 copies of each poem).  
This project has been very well-re-  
ceived and Willoughby is hoping for  
further funding to continue it next  
year.  

* Cayuga Creek Historical Press - is  
the only area press devoted exclusively  
to publishing works of history. It was  
established by Harley E. Scott, Lancas-  
ter Town Historian, who had previously  
published three books on the steamships  
of the Muskoka Region of Ontario. In  
1982, Cayuga Creek published Tales of  
Old Lancaster, which Scott wrote to-  
gether with Edward J. Mikula. Tales  

is a compendium of fact and folklore  

gathered from interviews with the to-  
wn of Lancaster's older citizens and the  
recollections of the two authors. A  
second volume of Tales is planned and  
the press is now preparing a condensed  
version of a three-volume definitive  
biography of Jesse Ketchum, Buffalo's  
early philanthropist. The Bountiful  
Baron of Buffalo: The Life of Jesse  
Ketchum was painstakingly researched  
by Dr. Herman Sass, the librarian of  
the Buffalo Historical Society and  
will be out soon.  

* Common Ground - this article would  

not be complete without mention of  
Common Ground, WNY's only newspaper  
for women which published its first  
issue in September, 1982. It speaks  
for itself.  

* Irving Press Collective - the area's  
newest small press (Common Ground,  
Jan/83) will be publishing the Buffalo  
Arts Review. BAR's first issue is  
slated for March, 1983.  

Mention should be made of two  
other projects related to small pres-  
ses in WNY: in addition to Allegheny and  
Orchard Press, the Buffalo Press Col-  
lective is also available for limited  
printing projects; secondly, a course  
on small press publishing is taught  
at Black Mountain College by Stephanie  
Wiseman, telephone 636-2137.  

It is obvious that publishing the  
small press way is alive and well in  
WNY--and promises to continue to  
flourish despite the many obstacles  
that small press publishing ventures  
have to face. ©
