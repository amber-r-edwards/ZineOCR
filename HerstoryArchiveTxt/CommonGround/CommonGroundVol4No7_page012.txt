WOMEN’S  
RESIDENTIAL  

‘available, and someone to push, cheer-  
lead and fill the gaps along the way.  
Since September, 24 women have stayed  
at the Resource Center and more than  
50 have been serviced by their Resource  
Unit. Ms. Ross Brown gave her views in  
an interview with CG.  

"Women are increasingly involved  
in the criminal justice system,” said  
Ms. Ross Brown. “We are concerned  
about the rights and dignity of wo-  
men, and concerned about their chil-  
dren when they are incarcerated.  
What happens to the kids, the apart—  
ment? We need to protect that child.  
Most women offenders have children,  
and they have a mother's concern for  
their kids, so something has to work."  

"We see our success as based on  
our services and the commitment of  
our staff," she continued. "It is  
based on our counseling relationship  
to our clients to bring about their  
commitment to change."  

“We assist a person to see a dif-  
ferent positive lifestyle; that there  
is hope and potential ability within  

‘MAN’ - HANDLED  

by Sharon Green  

If you have been under this common  
misconception, consider these words  
and phrases.  

-fellow, as in "my fellow Democrats."  
(Didn't we get the vote, too, some-  
where along the line, and then joined  
political parties?)  

-fellowship, in reference especially  
to religious work. (Most religions  
are patriarchal, anyway).  

-man-of-war, meaning both a warship  
and the jellyfish (the military is  
another flaming patriarchy).  

-man-eating tiger. (I guess we're  
not supposed to eat us, too).  

-dead-man's float, a swimming posi-  
tion. (But I thought I caught some  
women sneaking in those Olympic  
swim meets).  

-the odd man out. (Ironic, since  
that's what women often are).  

-All work and no play makes Jack a  
a man must have a  
wife!).  
-man in the street. (Well, a woman  
in the street would probably be  
considered a prostitute, anyway).

them. We do this through aggressive  
assistance; doing with, not for, a  
client, by providing role models and  
being firm," said Ms. Ross Brown,  
"We want them to successfully adapt  
to life, and will help by providing  
structure, a plan, based on their  
needs and goals as they see them.  

We must show a client success-mea-  
surable and attainable, in very small  
increments if need be."  

“I think the greatest thing is to  
self-actualize," she stated. "Until  
a person knows the self, they cannot  
interact successfully with others.  
We also teach our clients you can  
make a mistake, It's OK. You can  
go on. We want clients to accept  
responsibility; and have flexible,  
responsible behavior. They have  
been in a system which is rigid and  
impersonal, so we individualize,  
share ourselves with our clients.  

We care about them and this helps  
them care about themselves."  

Each day, a court liaison special-  
ist goes to City Court, evaluating  
and interviewing women residents of  
the County who have been arrested  
for misdemeanors, and non-penal law  
felonies, or who have been convicted  
as a result of plea negotiations on  
a Class D or E, non-violent felony.  
They are presented with an alternative  
to the traditional judicial process.  
They must make a commitment to work  
and remain crime-free. Women accepted  

at the Center must be verifiably drug-  

free for two years prior to this time.  
Women accepted by the Center must  
participate in positive changes in  
their lives through work, work train-  
ing, schooling or volunteer work, and  
they must be willing to go into the  
community and “do things." If a wo-  
man is willing and capable of making  
this kind of commitment (many are not,  
according to Ms. Ross Brown), they  

-scarred-haired boy, one who gets spe-  
cial favors; a favorite; a pet.  
(Seems, to me that quite a few girls  
in elementary school were teacher's  
pets, too).  

-a man of his word. (Does that sug-  
gest that all women are liars?).  

-a man of few words. (Would that  
they had fewer words about us!).  

-favorite son. (Was Ferraro a fa-  
vorite daughter?).  

-the man. (Never met his equal until  
the schlock purveyors invented She-  
Ra for kids).  

- John Q. Public. (I thought we  
were at least second class citi-  
zens).  

-John Hancock. (Apparently we  
don’t sign anything of import).  

-Tom, Dick and Harry, meaning  
people in general; anyone; every-  
one. (We all know that living  
beings are presumed male until  
proven otherwise. When in doubt,  
listen to people's comments at  
the zoo!).  

-boys will be boys.  

(Self-explanatory).  

are considered for placement at the  
Center, depending on previous crimi-  
nal record. This is arranged with  
the District Attorney, Judge, the  
client and her attorney. Referral  
services are offered to all women,  
whether or not they are initially  
interested in or qualified to be  
considered for the Center.  

The Women for Human Rights and  
Dignity, Inc. and the Resource Cen-  
ter are invaluable assets to the com-  
munity. Under the strong, compas-  
sionate administration of Jacquelyn  
Ross Brown, the Resource Center offers  
women whole-person, concrete, consis-  
tent support for change and improve-  
ment in their lives.  

The stability and growth of our program goals  
and commitment can be substantially  
enhanced with your support. All financial

ALERT!  

The most successful underlying  
elements of WHRD, Inc. are its  
concrete approaches to strength-  
ening the family unit through  
alternative sentencing and in-  
dividual support. The Erie  
County Community Sentencing  
Program - a referral service  
for Judges to apply alternative  
sentencing procedures county-  
wide - is under threat of eli-  
mination due to budget cuts and  
unfortunate political concerns.  
All research has shown that in  
other counties, similar programs  
have been cost-effective, produced  
measurable community benefits, and  
were especially valuable for trou-  
bled youth and non-violent offend-  
ers who needed social re-orienta-  
tion and a sense of worth. In one  
City Court the "success rate" for  
those who completed alternative  
sentences was 85%, the remaining  
15% being no-shows who nonetheless  
did NOT commit crimes on their as-  
signed work sites. Please contact  
your County Legislator to express  
your support for our local, State-  
funded alternative sentencing pro-  
grams.

been a man, since few women live  
this life).

women have traditionally been  
excluded from high finance).
