WomanExpress  

WomanExpress has been published with  
the assistance of a grant from Arts  
Council, Inc. The theme for this  
special issue, as expressed in the  
grant proposal, is “women's per-  
spectives as expressed through the  
arts." In other words, women  
speaking to women through their  
writing and artwork.  

G  

The response was gratifying, and the  
selections committee spent many  
hours individually reviewing each  
artist/writer's submission, then  
meeting together to reach a con-  
sensus on the work that would be  
used in the issue. The committee  
used two major criteria to review  
the work; the way in which each  
artist/writer's body of work ex-  
pressed the theme of the issue,  
the committee's judgement of the  
quality of the work. Because the  
body of work was the major emphasis,  
many individual works of merit could  
not be used.  

and  

Our thanks and appreciation to all  

of you who submitted your work, and  
a special thank you to the Arts  

for its  

Council support.  

This issue was possible in part  

by the Arts Council in Buffalo and  

# Erie County Regrant Program with  
public funds from the New York State
