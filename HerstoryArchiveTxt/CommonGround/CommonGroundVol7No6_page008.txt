news from  
Womanfocus

WOMANFOCUS is a prevention program  
designed to address the special  
stresses that impact on women's  
lives. Rather than masking feelings  
through such non-solutions as pre-  
scription drugs and other chemical  
substances, we explore various op-  
tions for leading healthy, produc-  
tive lives. Pre-registration and  
pre-payment are essential. Regis-  
tration is on a first-come, first-  
served basis. To pre-register call  
Womanfocus at 884-3256. Medicaid  
recipients $5 per workshop. Women  
60 and over: 20% discount. For  
fee adjustment, speak with a  
counselor. No one turned away  
because of inability to pay.
