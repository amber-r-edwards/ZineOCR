Studio =  

Long acknowledges that Studio  
Arena had accrued a massive deficit  
which had threatened keeping the  
theater open. Last year's program  
was selected with a sensitivity  
for what would have a broad box  
office appeal. This season is  
more balanced, where artistic con-  
cerns are as highly prioritized as  
financial ones. She stated, “If  
you're doing theater, but no one  
is watching it, you are being very  
self-indulgent. Ultimately, you  
are not meeting the goal of any  
theater—which is to communicate  
with the audience. The challenge  
for Studio Arena is to find a way  
to fulfill the artistic needs of  
people...and still present pro-  
ductions that have a wide appeal."

In an effort to make productions  
at the Theater as accessible as  
possible, a number of discussions  
and new programs are scheduled.  
There is also a variety of ticket  
prices available at all performances,  
and some performances are sign-inter-  
preted for the hearing impaired.  
You may call 856-5650 or 856-0011  
for further information.

Sharon Beck will be doing some  
theater reviews for Common Ground  
over the course of this year.
