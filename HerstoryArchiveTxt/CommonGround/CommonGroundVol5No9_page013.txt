Canisius College...the name
suggests conservative Catholics
in penny loafers and pin-striped
shirts. Yet, on March 25, Can-
isius was the setting for a
talk by CBS news correspondent
Diane Sawyer.

Her lively talk, entitled
“Reflections from the Road," was
part of the William Fitzpatrick
Chair of Political Science Lec-
ture series. Sawyer, a most
articulate and witty speaker,
was the 41st lecturer in this
series, yet only the second woman.
Yes, conservative traditions are
slowly broken.

However, Sawyer was an appro-
priate choice to break new ground.
She's broken the sex barrier in
the widely popular CBS program
"60 Minutes." Also, she's clearly
an intelligent and very experienced
journalist, whose travels have
afforded her much political in-
sight—all qualities and accom-
plishments that have for too long
been exclusive male clubs.

Before joining "60 Minutes” in
1984, she was co-anchor of CBS
Morning News. Her earlier ex-
perience included working as a
reporter and correspondent for
CBS, as well as several positions
in the Nixon administration's
press office. She has interviewed

such dignitaries as Ferdinand
Marcos, Margaret Thatcher, Prince
Charles and the late Indira Gandhi.
Furthermore, she has reported on
the hostage crisis in Iran, the
Three Mile Island accident, the
economic summit in El Salvador,
and the Soviet military buildup
near the Polish border in 1980-81.

To the Canisius audience, she
spoke of the value of a college
education, which isn't often
fully appreciated until after one
enters the professional world.
Sawyer, a Wellesley College grad-
uate, often misses the luxury
of time to read, as well as the in-
tellectual resources of a college
and its professors. She emphasized
that education involved learning
how to ask questions and how to
form connections. She also ad-
vised any future journalists to
learn to become “a good mirror off
of which to refract events,"
rather than a mere witness.

In her travels, she also noticed
that young people, especially stu-
dents, can be quite a force in
effecting political change. She
cited the influence and direction
of young people in Iran, in the
Khmer Rouge, and in the revolution
in China.

My only disappointment was that
Sawyer said little about her ex-
periences as a woman in a male-
dominated industry, and her ob-
servations from other patriarchal
countries. She mentioned that
she does not see herself as a
“polemical feminist," yet the
fact remains that she certainly
is a role model to aspiring women
journalists. Although she did
praise Corazon Aquino, housewife
turned political leader, she had
little else to say specifically
about women in any of the coun-
tries she has traveled to.

Finally, because I too am a
woman, I think it safe to add, in
a totally non-chauvinistic manner,
that Sawyer's beauty (enhanced
by her tailored red suit, a far
cry from preppie pin-stripes) was
most striking.

Rape and Sexual Assault
Crisis Services

834-3131

The Volunteer Supportive Ad-
vocate Program for Victims of
Rape and Sexual Assault is part
of Crisis Services of Buffalo.
The volunteers are women and
men who provide support to the
victims (both child and adult)
of this violent crime. There
are two types of advocates:
hospital and court. The hospital
advocate goes right to the hospi-
tal and assists the victim and
family with information about
hospital, police and general
court procedures. The advocate
will stay with the victim in
the emergency room and throughout
the initial examination (if re-
quested by the victim). The
court advocate assists the victim
and family/friends in getting
through court procedures (provid-
ing psychological comfort and
detailed information about the
various court proceedings).

The Advocate Program is pro-
vided free of charge and is
confidential. There is a 24 hour
hotline and hospital advocate
service. Currently there are
three area hospitals that handle
evidence collection and follow-
up care. They are: Erie County
Medical Center, 462 Grider Street,
Buffalo; Buffalo General Hospital,
100 High Street, Buffalo; and
Children's Hospital, 219 Bryant
Street, Buffalo (for young children
and adolescents under 18).

The program has recently pub-
lished a manual "Working With
Victims of Sexual Assault: A Re-
source Manual" which is made
available to law enforcement,
medical, mental health, criminal
justice, and other human services
personnel. Community members
will find it helpful in under-
standing the issue of sexual
assault. It is available for
purchase for $10 ($12.40 for the
manual plus postage) by contacting
Crisis Services. The program
also provides brochures contain-
ing information for parents re-
garding child sexual abuse, infor-
mation for child victims on going
to court and what to expect, and
a procedures and services booklet
which outlines everything step by
step from immediate information
needed to the reporting of the
sexual assault, medical care,
counseling, police, the district
attorney, court procedures, vic-
tim's rights, and information and
resource materials.

To become an advocate, an in-
terested person can either call
Crisis Services at 834-3131 or
mail in a volunteer reply card
to obtain an application. After
filling out the application, there
will be a personal interview with
the coordinator or assistant
coordinator of the program. If
accepted into the program, the
volunteer will be required to
attend seven training sessions
(twice weekly). In the first
session volunteers are “walked
through" the program. In the
next session police, DA's office
and court procedures are reviewed.
The later sessions are devoted to
sharpening listening skills and
role playing. Each session lasts
approximately three hours. Once
completing the training phase,
the volunteer is evaluated again,
after which time work as an advo-
cate begins. At this point, the
advocate must commit to the pro-
gram for six months. Advocates
are required to work either three
day shifts (6am to 6pm) of their
choice, or two night shifts (6pm
to 6am) of their choice each
month. The program has approx-
imately 50 active volunteers and
is always seeking interested
people. An upcoming training
session is scheduled to begin at
the end of May (training sessions
are usually held three to four
times a year). Volunteers have
a variety of backgrounds but have
a specific interest and general
knowledge of the area of rape
and sexual assault.

If you or anyone you know is
interested in receiving information
on becoming a volunteer advocate,

Volunteer Advocate Program, 3258
Main Street, Buffalo, N.Y. 14214.

because I'm a mom, I have pre-
cious little quiet time to myself.
So I treasured the extra time I
gained through celibacy.

Since I seldom go to movies,
and since I don't watch television
other than the news and children's
programs, I'm also not continually
exposed to sexual images and
sexuality. If I had seen more
TV shows and movies with scenes
of sex and romance, I'm sure my
celibacy would have bothered me
a lot more.

My biggest problem was that
even though sex might not enter
my thoughts for weeks at a time,
it did occasionally creep into
my dreams. Afterwards, I'd
awake with a tremendous feeling
of sadness. Only then did I
reminisce about old sexual en-
counters and yearn for more of
the same. So I think that even
during periods of celibacy, we
are all still sexual beings, even
if only on a subconscious level.

During celibate periods, some
women compensate by masturbating.
Some find masturbating allows
them to “discover their bodies in
a new way." Others find self-
pleasure only an interim remedy.

On March 6, 1986 - artist
Georgia O'Keeffe died. At the
age of ninety-eight few artists
can lay claim to having lived
such a rich and fulfilling life.
A frank woman who stood by her
convictions, Georgia bridged the
gap between American expressionism,
feminism and naturalism. Although
Georgia fiercely protested any
alliance her art had with the
feminist aspect, she was one of
only a handful of woman artists
in her time to gain notoriety in
a mostly male art world.

Miss O'Keeffe was my heroine
and mentor. I first learned of
her art when I was attending
college. Her giant flowers en-
tranced me with their magnitude
and simplicity. Crazy floating
bones and flat, little clouds
parade across her strong palette.
Yes, Georgia spoke to me through
her paintings. She taught me to
open a window onto life, see
everything, feel everything.
Then, express one tiny part of
that scene so well, that you were
actually carving out a place and
a time for that object to dwell
upon your canvas.

Georgia always dressed in
black. She reserved the spectrum
of colors strictly for her paint-

ings, therefore using every part
of her being in producing art.

She refused to be associated
with any particular style, pre-
ferring to create her own.
O'Keeffe's subject matter draws
heavily upon the natural forms and
objects of her surroundings.
Small things were important to
Georgia - a smooth stone, a shell,
a gnarled piece of wood. All held
importance to her and she would
commemorate their existence on
her canvases.

How can I possibly pay tribute
to an artist and a woman who has
touched my very soul? Who showed
me how to dream my dreams and
then to paint them. Georgia, you
will always be very missed by
the many that have come to love
your simplicity and directness.
Your legacy to the world will
continue to encourage and to
inspire all those that seek out
your vibrancy and majestic yearn-
ing for living. Although we
never met, your intimate presence
in my life manifested itself as
a friendship in spirit. News
of your death filled me with the
sorrow that binds itself in the
loss of a close friend. Farewell,
Georgia.

THE ART MUSEUM

It's like visiting old friends.
So many paintings by dear old friends
from my past, present, future.

I'm close to tears

standing before your mill

with the funny green sky - Vincent.

I want to reach out and touch you,
I can feel you standing

so close to me.

And O'Keeffe's two small,
unassuming paintings
draw me back again and again.

People pass by chitter-chattering
about concepts and colors,
and about what they think they know
and what they think they know
and what they have heard second hand.

But they don't feel for you as I do.

In another hall

are Stieglitz's work,
(O'Keeffe's companion, mentor and soulmate),

Stieglitz angrily stares down
upon passers-by in the tight hallway.
And they wonder at who
the bespectacled old man is.

They have no idea

of how O'Keeffe and Stieglitz were intertwined,
so entrenched in a world of creating.

A visit with old friends

brings such joy -

and yet such intimate sorrow
of the pain of understanding

that artists are different.
