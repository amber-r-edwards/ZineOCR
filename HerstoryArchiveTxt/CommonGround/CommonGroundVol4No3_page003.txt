POLICY

PHILOSOPHY - Common Ground is potentially, with
help from Western New York women, a forum to
celebrate the rich diversity of our community. We view
the paper as a ribbon that may connect our com-
monalities, our intersection points. We are inviting you
to participate actively in the building of a support system
for WNY women. We affirm our commitment to enhance
the lives of women on physical, educational, spiritual,
psychological, social and economic levels. We want to
present, fair-mindedly, the issues that concern women,
and information of value to women. We offer Common
Ground as a place where women can display their art
and personal literature, and review the tapestries of their
experiences.

EDITORIAL POLICY - Common Ground is especially
looking for articles which address the needs and interests
of local women.

1. Common Ground is a publication of news, culture
and dialogue from women’s perspectives.

2. News, Opinion, Analysis and Commentary will
each be clearly labeled as such.

3. We are seeking to provide accurate, straightforward
information of value to women.

4. The collective will not intentionally print or sup-
port materials or viewpoints which will harm women
because of color, sexuality, religious or ethnic
background, physical disability or economic situation.

5. While opinions expressed in Common Ground are
those of the authors and not necessarily those of the col-
lective as a whole, we do accept responsibility for choos-
ing what we print.

SUBMISSIONS — We welcome articles, letters, infor-
mation and announcements of interest to women.
Graphics, cartoons, art and photography will be grateful-
ly received. We especially invite women who do not
usually have access to traditional media - women of col-
or, differently abled, economically or educationally
disadvantaged, and those for whom English is a second
language - to write. Suggested length of letters: 250
words. Letters must be signed to be printed. We will,
however, respect your privacy and withhold your name
if you request. Suggested length of articles, commentary,
analysis: 500-750 words. Please type and double space
your work, 40 characters across. If you do not have ac-
cess to a typewriter, please print clearly. In time we hope
to have a typewriter, paper, etc., available for those who
request it. Include a stamped, self-addressed envelope
and work and home phone numbers. Because we want
to hear your voices, if your piece needs to be edited for
length or clarity, we will call you/ask you to do it. Keep
copies of your work. We will try to notify you within
three (3) weeks if we intend to use your work. If we print
it, we will give you five (5) copies of the issue in which
it appears. Artwork should be black and white copies
only, and title/describe your work. We will copyright the
entire issue, but the copyright on each piece reverts to
the author/artist, so that she may decide where her work
is printed. Please request a style sheet for further infor-
mation and guidelines if you want to write.
