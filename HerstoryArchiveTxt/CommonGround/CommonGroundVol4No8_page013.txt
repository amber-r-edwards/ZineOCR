TATRENEREEPATEN ORAS A NOTE FROM THE EDITORIAL BOARD

What an interesting issue this  
was to edit! First of all, there  
were a record number of submissions  
for this 4th annual issue of "Woman-  
Express". Over 70 different women  
sent in a variety of poems, short  
stories, and artwork, and making  
choices among these was a very diffi-  
cult thing to do. Not only was the  
quantity of submissions substantial,  
but we think the quality was also.

We agreed to ask a number of authors  
if we could hold their work for the  
future, so readers can look for  

some excellent material in subsequent  
issues of Common Ground.

One thing we noticed was the amount  
of work sent in that was done with a  
word processor. Poetry too is moving  
into the computer age!

A recurring theme of many of the  
authors was to address themselves to  
their mother, father, or grandparents;  
either living or dead. Perhaps this  
is symptomatic of a general feeling,  
at least among women of today, that

Other themes were represented also,  
but relative to past issues, we had  
far fewer submissions concerning poli-  
tical or "relationship" issues. We're  
not sure how to analyze the signif-  
icance of that!

But there was certainly variety  
in the background of the contrib-  
utors. The youngest published here  
is a high school sophomore, and the  
oldest is a great-grandmother. Many  
have a literary academic background,  
but others included factory workers,  
health care professionals and secre-  
taries. Some are writing for the  
first time, others are frequently  
published.

Thank you to all the contributors  
who made working on this issue an  
enjoyable and rewarding experience.  
We hope that you all stay in touch.

pursue her painting. When women were  
generally accepted at the academies,  
it proved to be an inadequate ges-  
ture, considering that the art world  
continued to be dominated by men and  
they had no outlet for their efforts,  
no galleries in which to exhibit, no  
dealers to sell their work. A strug-  

gle for equality of recognition con-  

tinues today among women artists.

In the early centuries the masses  
of women were literate. The  
first novels written in the mid-  
18th century, however, became  
more prolific and successful as  
writers than men, much to  
the latter's chagrin, some of  
whom didn't hesitate to take  
the women's books, so to speak, in  
order to win over the same readers.  
Not even Hawthorne was above that,  
though he called them "d---d female  
scribblers".

At that time, however, the novel  
was not considered a serious art form  
and women turned out sentimental,  
moralistic "best sellers". More women  
read novels than men and they could  
readily identify with the characters  
in the so-called feminine novels  
the radical, anti-  
work that men wrote.  

We don’t have to look too far into  
the past to find the meanings in  
their works. On the other hand,  
women writers appeared to  
accent their role  
though some were  
strong,  

in society and  
reformers like Harriet  
Beecher Stowe or writers of  
capable women like Edna  
Ferber, they didn't take up the cause  
of equality of the sexes. It wasn't  
until the women's movement that all  
of their pent-up fury spewed forth.

As Bernard states: "To the outside  
world's amazement, female culture—  
which had always seemed so placid, so  
satisfied with the status quo, so com-  
placent, even so cheerful—was re-  
vealed as a cloak for pain."

And Simone de Beauvoir said: "I  
have been criticized for my recent  
books. Some women complained that I  
did not present positive heroines,  
because I showed mostly broken, un-  
happy women. I did so because that  
is how I see and feel today's feminine  
condition. I have no desire to pre-  
sent heroic, militant women who I  
feel are nonexistent and utopian."

In the realm of poetry, women's  
experience has been less than edifying,  
whereas men have established a criteria  
of serious poetry based on their  
experiences, which they consider uni-  
versal, as opposed to the limited  
activities of women in their tradi-  
tional roles and sheltered lives.

As in prose, there were exceptions,  
like Elizabeth Barrett Browning and  
Amy Lowell.

By the early part of this century,  
women poets suffered from their iso-  
lation, the lack of a support system  
that men already had, and their  
efforts revealed an ambivalence between  
their identity as women and the ex-  
pectations of a sexist society. Just  
to be a serious poet was enough to  
set a woman apart from other women  
as "odd". Consequently, they pro-  
duced popular poetry, usually un-  
realistic in its image of women. It  
was not until the women's movement  
with its new sense of unity, broke from  
the mindset of the past that women  
poets began to unleash their frustra-  
tions and challenge the criteria  
stemming from male tradition with  
their own valid concept of the  
universal.
