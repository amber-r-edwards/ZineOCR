CONFERENCE REPORT

SEX ‘How Much is Not Enough?

by Kay Patterson

Editor's Note: The following is
the second article in a report on a
conference on lesbian psychologies
held in Boston in March.

Margaret Nichols, a sex therapist
from Jersey City, N.J., is noted for
her willingness to challenge her
audience with controversial informa-
tion.

Her presentation at the American
Women in Psychology Conference on
lesbian psychologies being no excep-
tion, Nichols told her audience of
500 women that:

---women are half as likely as men
to recognize sexual arousal,
---lesbian couples in long-term re-

lationships have sex far less frequent-
ly than gay men or heterosexual couples.

Half of lesbian couples in long-term
relationships have genital sex once
a month or less.
---lesbians are more limited in their
range of sexual techniques than gay
men or heterosexuals. Sixty per cent
of lesbian couples have oral sex in-
frequently or never.
---lesbians prefer kissing and touch-
ing to actual lovemaking.
---lesbians are more monogamous than
gay men or heterosexuals. They
also break up more frequently than
gay men or heterosexuals.

This particular audience contained
a large proportion of lesbians and
reactions to her presentation were
electric--from knowing looks of con-
firmation to angry protests of its
inaccuracy.

But there was more.

Nichols, who is a lesbian, drew
a picture of typical lesbian rela-
tionships using her own clinical ex-
perience as a guide.

Lesbians are romantics, she said,
and their relationships reflect that,
especially in the beginning.

Lesbians tend to develop a deep
bond of intimacy which remains intact
even if sexual problems develop, she
said. Unlike heterosexuals or gay
men, lesbians tend to maintain warm
emotional relationships and a high

level of kissing, touching and hugging

no matter how much or how little gen-
ital sex they are having.

However, she said, an inhibited
desire for genital sex is the most
frequent sexual problem lesbian cou-
ples face and it is an important
reason that many couples break up.

It is perhaps because her presen-
tation was so controversial that it
was also very important. Throughout
the rest of the conference, women
talked and argued about the informa-
tion and, in this process, shared
more of their own experience.

In the world at large, lesbianism
is perceived and mythologized as a
highly sexualized social issue. The
morality of homosexuality is debated.
The ability of lesbians to contain
their sexual desires in the presence
of children and heterosexual women
is a source of concern to some in
the straight community. The image
of two women as sexual partners
sparks curiosity, speculation, alarm
and worse.

But what is real about lesbian
sexuality is much less frequently
discussed, even among lesbians.

Nichols' statistical information
came from two sources: a study of

of American couples by sociologist

Phillip Liumstein and Pepper Schwartz
and a study on sexual arousal by
researcher Julia Heiman.

Nichols' clinical picture of the
reality of lesbian sexuality raised
some questions. Some of these were
addressed later in the conference at
a seminar on sex therapy run by
Nichols.

For example, what is the standard
by which an inhibition of sexual
desire is judged, or how much is not

enough?

Nichols states that if the fre-
quency of lovemaking is agreed upon
by both partners, then it is not a
problem. Relationships have a natural
tendency to cool in their sexual ardor
after the "honeymoon period."

If, however, one or both partners
feel blocked in their desire for the
other, or there is a discrepancy be-
tween partners in the frequency with
which they desire sex, it is a prob-
lem.

Why does it happen?

She offered some educated guesses:
---women tend not to pressure each
other for sex. In fact, she said,
some women feel any expression of
dissatisfaction with the frequency
of sex in their relationships is an
oppression of their partners. It
carries a connotation of a demand for
performance that many women reject:
---for lesbians, sex usually happens
in the context of a loving relation-
ship. That means that sex and love
can become fused and problems in a
relationship--especially problems
which are not expressed--take a toll
on the sexual part of a relationship.
In particular, she said, couples who
have trouble fighting, also have
trouble with inhibitions in their
desires for each other.

---lesbians are less "lookist," or
less inclined to choose partners on
the basis of outward attractiveness.
---perhaps the very intimacy which
lesbians are generally skilled at
creating eliminates the tension and
distance needed for a high sexual
drive.

Another question: if lesbians are
good at creating intimacy, why do
they break up so often?

Nichols thinks that it has to do,
in part, with the level of romance
lesbians like in their relationships.
When the relationship gets past the
honeymoon phase, it is harder to
create romance and, unless the couple
can do that, one or the other partner
will look for it elsewhere.

Her prescription for a happy,
long-term sexual relationship con-
tained two major components: acknow-
ledge that sex is an important part
of the relationship and learn how to
create what you need to keep the sex
alive and fun.

"When you are in a highly erotic-
ally charged state, you can have de-
sire spontaneously," she said. "After
that you need a plan. Those highly-
charged states are infrequent in a
long-term relationship."

She suggested setting aside time
for sex, and introducing as much
variety as possible by use of differ-
ent settings and techniques, fanta-
sies, rituals and games.

One conference participant told a
story of a couple who establish peri-
odic evenings to "meet each other"
again.

Each dresses up and goes to a bar
or community event at which she "meets"
her lover. Sometimes they involve
friends in these evenings. The
friends sit with one partner and
make introductions when the other
partner arrives.

Although games such as this may
seem artificial at first, Nichols
said, they can be life-enhancing for
women in long-term relationships.

Another issue affecting lesbians'
sexual relationships, Nichols said,
is the degree to which lesbians ab-
sorb the societal hostility to their
homosexuality.

This was the subject of another
conference workshop, "Internalized
Homophobia: Identifying and Treating
the Oppressor Within."

The work presented had been done
by three women, Karla Jackson-Brewer
and Liz Margolies of New York City
and Martha Becker of Brooklyn, N.Y.

They describe the oppressor within
as the part of a lesbian's psyche
which accepts and even magnifies so-
ciety's fears about homosexuality.

In the lesbian community, they
said, society's fears and sanctions
against homosexuality are often coun-
teracted by gay rights political
activity and consciousness raising.
