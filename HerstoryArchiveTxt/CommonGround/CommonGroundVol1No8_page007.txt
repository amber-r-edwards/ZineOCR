The Collective Eats... | CAR-ASHA

(OR, REAL MEN DON'T FIX CARS)

The CG Layout Committee at-
tended their second monthly post-
layout bacchanalian feast at a
local cafe. Many vital issues
were discussed and options pon-
dered, such as “which wine, the
imported or domestic?" and "how
many calories could there pos-
sibly be in a seafood quiche?"

A new world record was set for
time taken ordering dinner.

One member of the committee
had the opportunity to meet a new
friend in the restaurant lavatory.
Our waitress "plunged" into a deep
conversation on one of the more
serious topics of the evening:
does one stand up or sit down or
halfway? She was totally "bowled"
over by the entire group and re-
marked that she wished she could
join us (if we hadn't been quite
so "flushed" from the wine we
could have asked if she had a 12
pitch typewriter). A good time
was had by all--all four hours
of rambling.

-..-oh yeah, and the COLLECTIVE
MEETS, too. We had a big business
meeting last month about all sorts
of heavy topics. Beforehand, a
whole bunch of us met at another
local bistro. About 12 of us sat
cosily around a table for 8. The
meeting started at 7:30, I think.
About 20 people were there. The
main points: SELECTIONS. SMOKING.
NOT SMOKING. LOONIE TUNES CON-
TRIBUTORS. WINE. SELECTIONS.
SELECTIONS. SELECTIONS. WINE.

prepared by members of the non-
processing caucus of the CG
Collective)

Will Perk You Up

And Put You in a Better Mood!

To tell all of you girls
to get back to your places
and out of the job market
where you steal jobs from
men...while I comment on
foreign policy, nuclear
weapons, the draft...

It was time for his annual inspec-
tion at Gerta's Garage.

"Let's take a look at your dip-
stick," she said. "Oh dear, it's
lower than usual. You could use
some lubrication."

She poured oil on his manifold
and his camshaft seized up. "Take
it easy," he yelled, "my engine
feels like it's on fire!"

"Don't worry," said Gerta, "I
won't knock it up."

She took a look at his spare
tire. "It looks a bit soft. Have
you tried to jack it up recently?"

"What's the verdict?" he asked,
trembling. "Well, it could be worse,"
said Gerta. “However, your fan belt
is slipping, your cylinders are mis-
sing, and your rod is bent. You
need a good valve job."

"Also," she said, “your nuts are
loose. I'll just give them a twist."

"Oh," he said, “that's much better!"

It was all Greek to him. “How
much?" he asked. “Depends on
whether you want a temporary fix or
our custom handiwork."

"Let's go all the way," he said.
"After all, you're the expert."

And she was. Another satisfied
customer left Gerta's Garage.
