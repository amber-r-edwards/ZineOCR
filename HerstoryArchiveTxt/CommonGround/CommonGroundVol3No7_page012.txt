Limbo

1. the absence

across the street

headlights touch the houses like fires

I look for notes, old tools, Army photos, a pair of wooden shoes,
some key to his past.

I cover the chairs with sheets

digest minutes.

my father's house--

he is still

on the porch, tucked

into a wool blanket which I tug from him

to spread over his ancient chest as we leave.

In the airport in Venezuela
I speak casually and the operator cuts in--
it shouldn't have happened, he didn't mean to.
When I meet my mother on the grey stone pier,
my father stands near the end,
no color in his skin or the sky.
He is not sure whether or not to look at me,
but I hug him, lift him into the air,
as he used to hold me—
he is so light and still warm.
My mother sadly explains his death
as if we were both children,
and my father puts his arms around mine,
he lays his head on my shoulder.
When I lift him again, he is much lighter
and I can give him no heat of my own.

2. the visit

I have left the yellow light on in the sitting room,
grandmother's quilt on the bed,

anything I can find to give you,

as you may be here before I get back.

Crystals grow in your bones,
settle you into your chair.
“A few items around you,
the afternoon paper,
a miniature oil of your mother
in her blue chiffon and pearls—
I look always for new evidence of who you are.

It is my duty to ask you everything else—
have you slept
are you hungry
My sisters and I are quick to applaud when you plan
as if you were a child in a piano recital
who lost his place for a moment—
We are all slow to talk.

Perhaps I will walk you through the scenes of my latest life:
a drink at the corner
a poetry reading
scattered mimeographs

I come up the stairs, key in hand,
looking for you in the warm light

but I have arrived in your absence.

Mothering My Mother

over the phone

the wires crackle and
bend that connect your
house with mine your ear
and mouth with my ear
and mouth the boundaries
of who and what we are
wash together like

the unfinished paintings
in your basement mildewing
against the wall one
running into the other

we are losing

each other onto each other
I cannot hold out to

be your therapist for too long
my support you twist
because of how much you
have drunk how you continue
to drink while we talk

like I am a crisis line
listening to someone kill
themselves

your illness isn't prescriptioned
isn't sold under the counter

or bootlegged out in a dark wood
it is shared it is sickeningly social
a public gaiety different from mine
my sisters won't let you drink

in their house won't let you

crawl along the floor and

grab onto their ankles beseeching
rejecting name-calling them

into a frenzy

I have never let you do this to me
but you crawl into so many

of my stories and poems

in this way you are grabbing

onto more than just my ankles

I am obsessed

by you and your drinking

like you are with your drinking
drink drink drink and drank

and drunk you must find

another way of watering yourself
of fueling on what is good
eating the flowers that grow
along people's houses

I will not be embarrassed of
your dancing up and down

in the neighbors’ driveways

if you do it deliberately
because you are happy

I shut you out until we
can both celebrate a
dry season without your
staggering tongue your
self-abusive fits

in the winter

when it gets hard

to fight alone

I will turn with you

on ice our sober blades
figuring and scraping
with definite edges
speaking beyond your
thin, desperate call

we will find a language

that does more than skim

and sink we will speak

as if we are about to
discover something beneath
the skin and teeth and tongue
we will speak as if we

bore each other today
painfully I call you

out of the drink

I call you out and up and up and up
