DR. JANICE KARLEN 1ST VEEP AT ECC

The Board of Trustees of the  
Community College has unanimously  
selected Janice M. Karlen as vice-  
president of the North Campus,  
the highest office ever held by  
a woman in the 46-year history of  
the school. Dr. Karlen, 32, Dean  
of Business and Personnel at Antelope  
Valley Community College in  
California, was chosen from a  
pool of 5 finalists selected from  
about 40 applicants. Elizabeth,  
the Board member who chaired  
the search committee, noted Dr.  
Karlen's concerns about student  
retention and working with community  
advisory boards, adding, "She had  
a very sound educational background  
and seemed very good at following through on things." The new vice president  
who will assume her duties this  
Spring, earned her bachelor's  
degree at Kean College and her  
doctorate at Seton Hall. Dr.  
Karlen was an accountant and  
auditor at Exxon Corporation,  
projects manager at Rutgers Univer-  
sity, a member of the Chamber of  
Commerce and affirmative action  
officer at Antelope Valley Community  
College.

AWARDS

The National Coalition for Women  
and Girls, comprising more than 50  
non-governmental organizations whose  
aims are expansion of education and  
career opportunities for women and  
girls, has given an award to New  
York State's Education Department,  
recognizing their innovative use of  
Vocational Educational Act funds,  
for programs initiated by Buffalo's  
Everywoman Opportunity Center.

Everywoman, which operates the  
W.N.Y. Displaced Homemaker Centers,  
was cited for creating job training  
programs for homemakers, displaced  
homemakers and single parents,  
using Vocational Education Act funds,  
Job Training Partnership Act, United  
Way, and Community Action Organiza-  
tion for assistance and support.

SOJOURNER TRUTH

Sojourner Truth, a black ex-  
slave, abolitionist and early fem-  
inist has been honored by a postage  
stamp, issued in New Paltz. Her  
stamp was issued as part of a  
Black Heritage Series.

CHILD CARE ISSUE

One out of every four working  
women has a child under 12 years  
old, according to a story by Peter  
Francese in the Buffalo News. This  
makes day care and after school  
programs a growth industry (worth  
potentially $20 billion a year) and  
an issue employers are being forced  
to look at. Employer provided or  
paid for child care is one of the  
most attractive fringe benefits for  
employees (male and female) to ask  
for, and for employers to offer.

SEARLE ABORTION IUD SALES

G.D. Searle and Co. announced  
its discontinuation of IUD sales  
in the United States. Todd R.  
Hullen, Vice President of Commun-  
ications for Searle's pharmaceutical  
group stated, "Searle made  
this decision because of mounting  
unjustified litigation in the  
United States that has made  
future product liability insurance  
virtually unobtainable...We and  
many physicians deeply regret  
this action because it limits the  
choices of the American public  
in the birth control methods  
available." Searle stated that both  
the CU-7 Intrauterine Copper Contracep-  
tive and the TAYTUM-T Intrauterine  
Copper Contraceptive presently  
used by many women, do not have  
to be removed until three years  
following insertion, and contends  
they still have full confidence  
in their safety and effectiveness.  
775 suits involving IUDs have been  
filed against Searle over the past  
12 years. Of the 470 resolved  
cases, 33% were dismissed or no  
payment was made, all but 10 of  
them settled to avoid litigation  
costs. 8 of the remaining 10  
cases were won by Searle who spent  
over $1.5 million successfully defend-  
ing the CU-7 in 4 recent jury trials.
