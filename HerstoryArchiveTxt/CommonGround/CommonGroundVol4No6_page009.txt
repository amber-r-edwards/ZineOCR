MARGARET MEAD:  
A LIFE  

book review by Deborah Jop  

In the 1950s, when ambitious  
women were regarded with suspicion,  
or at best ignored, Margaret Mead  
became a household word. This wo-  
man not only forged her way into  
the field of anthropology, taking  
on a number of cultures to study  
in depth, but also managed to  
popularize it so that the average  
American listened to what her works  
were all about. It was with much  
curiosity that I picked up her  
recently published biography,  
Margaret Mead - A Life, by Jane  
Howard. As the author states in  
the preface, this is not meant to  
compete with the other biographies  
written by her intimates and fellow  
academics, but is rather a "gene-  
ralist's portrait" -- and for that  
reason, perhaps a bit less biased  
or sugarcoated than others might  
tend to do.  

In the text Ms. Howard gives us  
an overview of the three native  
cultures that “led” devoted so much  
of her life to studying along with  
some of the discoveries she made  
there. The anecdotes she relates  
concerning Mead's encounters with  
the natives, from coping with the  
cannibalism and headhunting of a  
New Guinea tribe to the sexual ex-  
plicitness of the Samoans, are  
fascinating.  

All of these people had at least  
some difficulty in accepting and  
understanding her coming to their  
lands as a 'lone' woman without a  
mate. There always seemed to be  
some confusion about where to house  
her and how to address her, both  
when she was unmarried and also at  
the times she left her husband at  
home in the States. These chapters,  
however, I found far too brief.  
The author spends about an equal  
amount of time on Mead's relation-  
ships with her three husbands,  
which tended to be rather dull in  
comparison to her career. And  
since Mead left a considerable deal of her  
only child's upbringing to others,  
this section, too, pales in com-  
parison to her field endeavors.  

Howard exposes more than a few  
of Mead's weaknesses, such as her  
tendency to make rather broad one-  
line generalizations about nation-  
alities, as she did about practi-  
cally everything else. Also,  
since her dedication to her work  
often left her scant time to cul-  
tivate many in-depth relationships  
she was often accused of riding  
roughshod over people (unacceptable  
to this day, if you are female).  

In the last chapters the de-  
scription of Mead's bout with the  
pancreatic cancer that eventually  
led to her death is particularly  
touching, especially given what we  
know about her ‘autonomy’ and deter-  
mined character.  

I whole-heartedly recommend the  
book for anyone looking for a well-  
rounded view of one of the most  
famous and certainly most inter-  
esting women of the last half cen-  
tury.

According to Chinese astrology,  
1986 will be the year of the Tiger,  
which means the year should come  
in with a bang and go out with a  
whimper. How do you like it so  
far? In 1986 the Chinese New Year  
falls on February 9 so we have a  
short time in which to brace our-  
selves for the initial jolt.  

In her very readable book, The  
Handbook of Chinese Astrology,  
Theodora Lau dives a glimpse into  
the arcane study of Chinese astro-  
logy. From her I learned that the  
year of the Tiger is characterized  
as being explosive, with events  
taking on bold dimensions. Extremes  
are the norm. We should be careful  
about new undertakings begun during  
a Tiger year as they may be fragile  
and easily broken. While this vi-  
tality can be destructive it can  
also be beneficial in revitalizing  
stagnant business ventures and ca-  
reers, or personal relationships.  
Like “Hurricane,” which occurred  
during a Tiger year, the tempestuous  
climate of the Tiger year can be  
cleansing.  

I naively assumed someone born  
in the year of the Tiger would re-  
ceive preferred treatment from Fate  
during the year of the Tiger, but  
such is not the case. My husband  
is a Tiger - heh, heh, heh - and  
the best he can hope for is a so-  
so year. I, on the other hand  
being a Snake - watch it - can’t  
look forward to a year of minor  
irritations that will tax my self-  
control but earn me brownie points  
if I don't seek revenge.  

The origins of Western astrology  
are dim but in his book, A Time For  
Astrology, Tess Stearn writes, “While  
in the Middle East the Tigris-Eu-  
phrates valley has been consi-  
dered the cradle of astrology and  
civilization, astrology was already  
in an advanced stage five thousand  
years ago when the Sumerians be-  
came the first we know of to apply  
it empirically." The Chinese be-  
lieve Buddha originated theirs.  

The story goes that at the time  
Buddha was ready to leave this  
world, he summoned all the world's  
creatures to say goodbye. Only  
twelve showed up. Buddha rewarded  
their devotion by naming a year  
after each one of them in the or-  
der of their arrival and assigning  
their characteristics to those hu-  
mans born in their year. Thus we  
have the year of the Rat, Ox, Ti-  
ger, Rabbit, Dragon, Snake, Horse,  
Sheep, Monkey, Rooster, Dog and  
Boar.  

Surprisingly, even though our  
Western calendar and astrology  
are sun-centered while those of  
the Chinese are lunar-centered,  
there are a number of similarities  

YEAR OF  
THE TIGER  

between the astrology practiced by  
Orientals and that practiced by us.  
For instance, the various designa-  
tions are given animal names, ex-  
cept the Chinese slip in a couple  
of reptiles; the Snake and the  
Dragon; and a bird, the Rooster.  
As noted before I am designated  

as a Snake, which in Western think-  
ing isn't too complimentary, but  
it's no worse than being referred  
to as a Rat or a Dog. Or an Ox.  

I couldn't handle Ox.  

There are also ascendants in  
both genres, bearing the same names  
as the primary signs. The Chinese  
ascendant indicates the location  
of the moon at one's time of birth;  
in Western astrology the ascendant  
indicates the zodiac sign on the  
horizon at one's birth time. In  
both forms the ascendant stamps  
the personality and accordingly  
mitigates the characteristics of  
one's primary sign.  

Then there are elements. West-  
ern astrology assigns one of four  
elements to a sign: i.e., Aries  
is a fire sign, Taurus is earth,  
Gemini air, Cancer water, and so  
on through the Zodiac. In Chinese  
astrology the basic material element,  

either fire, water, earth, metal  
or wood, complements the year pro-  
ducing such things as an Earth  
Dragon or a Metal Monkey. Again,  
elements are mitigating influences.  
Some combinations are especially  
feared by the Chinese and the  
prospect of bringing a Fire Horse  
Child into a family is regarded  

as courting disaster.  

It is possible to roughly cor-  
relate the twelve Earth Branches,  
as the Chinese animal signs are  
called, with our Western Zodiac  
because each month in the Chinese  
lunar calendar also has an animal  
name. Consequently, the Ox (Jan-  
uary) shows Capricorn's traits, the  
Tiger (February) resembles Aquarius  
and the Rabbit shares March with  
Pisces. The Dragon and Aries domi-  
nate April, May is home to the Snake  
and Taurus, the Horse and Gemini  
represent June, the Sheep personality  
has much in common with July's Cancer  
and August houses the Monkey and Leo.  
The Rooster and Virgo typify August,  
the tail-waving Dog keeps his balance  
in September as does Libra, the Roar,  
is equated with Scorpio in November,  
and December people are either a Rat  
or a Sagittarius.  

But to the Chinese the factor  
that determines character is the  
animal ruling the year of one's birth.  
If you would like to know "the ani-  
mal that lives in your heart," drop  
me a note c/o Common Ground stating  
your year of birth and, if possible,  
the time. Also enclose a SASE for  
my reply.  

Happy New Year, or as the Chinese  
say, "Sun li nian fai yok." Or words  
to that effect.
