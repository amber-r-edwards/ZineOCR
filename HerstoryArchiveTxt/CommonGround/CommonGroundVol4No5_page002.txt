COMMON GROUND-

NOW Buffalo and Erie County Chapters 5th Annual

Women Helping Women Awards

Buffalo and Erie County Chapters
of the National Organization of
Women presented their Women-Helping-
Women awards for 1985 at the annual
dinner held on December 18th. The
contributions made by the award
winners were wide and far-reaching,
as can be seen by the following

CONSTANCE EVE

Constance Eve is the Chair of
Women for Human Rights and Dignity
(WHRD) and founder of the Women's
Educational Resource Center. Under
Ms. Eve's direction, WHRD was formed
several years ago to help incarcerated
women to keep in close contact
with their families and to show
support for these women. WHRD has
grown from being a supportive
organization to restoring an older
house in Buffalo which is being used
as a residence for women in trouble
with the law and as an alternative
to incarceration. The Women's
Resource Center, based on a family
philosophy, assists women in re-
directing and strengthening their
own life coping skills essential
for survival. Through creative and
substantive training and counseling
programs, WHRD's efforts are helping
to decrease significantly the number
of young women who enter the criminal
justice system.

PEGGY CHINN

Peggy Chinn, PhD., Professor
of Nursing, SUNYAB, is a notable
woman in her field for many
reasons. While in pediatric
nursing, Ms. Chinn developed a
revolutionary way of feeding
compromised infants in Intensive
Care, and went on to write a number
of widely used texts in child
health maintenance. Her current
work centers on nursing theory
and research where she has helped
to elevate the field to its pro-
per status as a science in itself,
rather than a view of nurses as
only handmaidens to doctors. As
a leader in this field, she has
done the pioneer work on feminism
in nursing, which has done a great
deal to increase women's self-
worth in their career as nurses.

In 1982, Ms. Chinn founded Cassandra:
The Radical Feminist Nurses Network,
to encourage feminist nurses to
become a force for progress in
their profession. She founded and
serves as editor of one of the
nation's top nursing journals.

In addition to all of this, she
finds time for substantive volun-
teer work on behalf of women.

JO OSBORNE

Jo Osborne has demonstrated her
extraordinary commitment to the pre-
servation and protection of the
rights of all women. She is well
known for her position as Public
Affairs Coordinator for Planned
Parenthood and as an articulate,
passionate spokesperson on repro-
ductive choice. Ms. Osborne came
forward to activate the Pro-Choice
Communications Network and was
instrumental in organizing an
escort service at one of our besieged
community abortion clinics. When the
anti-choice forces attempted to block
the opening of a new contraceptive
clinic, Ms. Osborne organized community
forces to mount a letter writing campaign
that brought about HSA approval of the
clinic's opening. All of this has
been accomplished with considerable
self-sacrifice, and exemplary dedi-
cation to the highest values of NOW.

Planned Parenthood of Buffalo
and Erie County has been serving
women and their interests for over
52 years. It was founded in 1933
by a group of local women who re-
