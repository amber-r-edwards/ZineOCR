For the second time, this  
column is featuring an interview  
with one of CG's collective  
members. Perhaps not all our  
readers know that this newsjournal  
is put out, from beginning to  
end, by a group of about 30  
women who volunteer both their  
skills and their time. What's  
more, some of them have been  
with CG since we began in 1982.

What kind of woman would give  
up some of her spare time to work  
on one or more facets of this  
newsjournal? And what motivates  
her to do this work month after  
month?

Both regular subscribers and  
occasional CG readers quickly  
become acquainted, by reading  
our writing, with those of us  
who have a byline in the paper.  
But what about the non-writers,  
the “behind-the-scenes" women  
whose work is just as crucial?  
Let me introduce you to one of  
these women: Laura Bartlett  
Maied.

How did you first get involved  
with Common Ground?

At the time CG began, I was  
involved with NOW, and a few  
other politically left movements.

I was in the left feminist community,  
but I was somewhat dissatisfied.  
I'd had my share of meetings and  
talking. I wanted to do something.  
I like to see a final product.

In 1982, I was involved in a  
coalition that helped bring  
“Voices of Women Writing" poetry  
readings and writing workshops  
by Adrienne Rich, Audre Lorde,  
Gloria Anzaldua, Hattie Gossett,  
Mirtha Quintanales and Barbara  
Smith to the old Oscar Micheaux  
Theatre in Buffalo. It was at  
this time that I met the five women  
whose idea it was to begin a  
women's newspaper here in W.N.Y.

I was skeptical at first. I  
felt like I knew my way around the  
feminist community, but I didn't  
know these five women. I wondered  
if they really knew what they were  
getting themselves into, and all  
that would be involved in putting  
out a newspaper.

What vast jobs or skills have  
enabled you to contribute to CG?

I worked as a typesetter at  
that time. In fact, I first felt  
a bit of pressure because they  
depended on me and one other  
woman for our typesetting and  
layout skills. However, now I  
feel comfortable about the fact  
that others at CG have learned so  
much that layout can be done  
without me. I used to go to  
layout both days. CG layout  
occurs once a month, on Saturday  
and Sunday afternoons, and I'd  
feel guilty if I didn't go both  
days. Now I usually try and go  
at least once every layout weekend.

Introducing: Laura

Selected

What sorts of tasks have you  
done for CG?

I've done xeroxing, typing,  
layout and typesetting. In college,  
I was the managing editor of the  
Spectrum at U.B. My original  
career goal was to be a journalist.  
But then I got into typesetting,  
which I've been doing for about  
10 years. I'm at a transitional  
period in my life, and I am looking  
to do different things for CG,  
such as writing and editing.

Why have you stuck with us for  
nearly four years?

It's really the only thing I've  
stuck with. My life has changed  
so much over the years. I used  
to just work, come home, and then  
go to meetings. I was very active  
in N.A.M. and N.O.W. That kind  
of work is important, and I still  
have an affection for people who  
do that. I used to live that  
life totally, but at some point I  
needed a change in my life. I  
lost weight, I moved and I  
changed jobs. I now work in a  
very professional environment  
at Goldome Bank, and I enjoy it  
very much.

But CG was the thing I had  
been looking for that would be  
satisfying feminist work. It's  
one of the few things from that  
earlier period in my life that  
I still have.

Can you share with our readers  
anything that you have gained  
by being a part of a women's  
newsjournal collective?

First and foremost are the  
wonderful friends I've gained.  
I don't know if I would have met  
some of these women under any  
other circumstances. Also, as  
other things in my life have  
changed, CG has given me some  
continuity and it has helped me  
maintain some connection to  
feminist ideals. It makes me  
feel like I'm doing something.

CG has also introduced me to  
many different kinds of women  
that I hadn't met in my earlier  
political work. I've seen lots  
of differences in women's lives.  
There are as many different  
kinds of lifestyles, marriages,  
child-raising arrangements, etc.,  
as there are women—and they are  
all wonderful. Working on CG  
has made me even more open-minded  
than I was before.

Tell us a bit about your life  
outside CG.

This is a transitional time  
for me in a lot of ways. I'm go-  
ing to graduate school for my  
MBA. Management is a very dif-  
ferent thing for me. In under-  
graduate school and for some  
graduate school, I was an English  
major. Now I'm faced with courses  
like statistics and computer math,  
but now I'm finding that I can  
do it. Getting a B in Algebra  
might be a small thing to someone  
else, but to me it was a major  
accomplishment. It made me feel  
that I can do other things that  
I thought I couldn't before. I'm  
changing and growing more now  
than I have in a long time. I  
feel like anything is possible.

What dreams do you have for CG's  
future?

I'm just hoping that CG will con-  
tinue. I'd like to see us have  
more of a foundation and become  
more of a professional organiza-  
tion. I'd love to see us have a  
real office, a typesetter and a  
part-time office worker, for in-  
stance. I'd like to see us out-  
grow being a shoe-string organ-  
ization. For CG to survive in  
the long run, we'll have to grow.

Would you like to say anything to  
women who may be thinking of  
becoming involved in CG?

It gives women a chance to  
learn skills that they might not  
learn elsewhere. Layout is a  
very good example. Working with  
CG is a good opportunity for women  
to get hands-on practice in all  
the things that go into putting  
together a newsjournal. It's also  
a chance to get to know some  
really nice women!
