Buffalo Seminary

'Girls are Cheered,

Not Cheerleaders’

From page 4

A study done of girls' schools in
Australia, which seemed to indicate
that girls emerged from single
sex education with a sense of self
somewhat more intact. Pretty thin
stuff, in truth!

I was engaged in that fruitless
task because the trustees of The
Seminary—the preeminent, oldest
(founded 1851), non-sectarian
private high school for girls in
this end of the state—were agoniz-
ing about whether to merge with
a prominent boys' school. The
advantages to the merger were
obvious. Buffalo was even then
sliding downhill economically,
and the pool of applicants willing
to pay thousands of dollars a
year for something that is free
down the street was shrinking.
Also, as I said, merger was the
fad back then, and educational
fads are hard to resist, as rust-
ing language labs attest to. In
addition, there was a lot of talk
then about the “naturalness” of
coeducation. "After all, it's
a coeducational world" was a popu-
lar saying, the implication being
that somehow single-sex schools
were not preparing their graduates
for “life”.

Perhaps they were not. Perhaps
they are not. But schools like
The Seminary do a marvelous, docu-
mentable job of preparing their
girls for college. Moreover,
single-sex colleges seemed to be
doing a marvelous job of preparing
their graduates for "life". I recall
a study done—a self-serving one?
—by Mt. Holyoke that purported
to show that a higher proportion
of Holyoke graduates ended up in
careers and professions than Rad-
cliffe graduates—that educations—
but that’s another topic that Common Ground
may wish to pursue.

Why single-sex education for
girls ages fourteen to eighteen?
There are a number of standard
answers. One is that removing
the distraction of boys, who tend
to dominate and who tend to be
favored by teachers, allows girls
to blossom academically. In a
single-sex school, whatever is
done in whatever field, is done,
perforce by a girl. The top math
student is a girl. The top sci-
ence student is a girl. Pursuing
that idea, one can add that
the top athlete is a girl. ("At
Seminary, the girls are the cheered,
not the cheerleaders" was one
alumna's contribution.) As someone
from the other camp, I can attest
from my experience in a large co-
educational public school that
there was a heck of a lot going
on in classrooms that had nothing
whatsoever to do with the subject
under study. Most of it was highly
questionable and could have been
more justifiably conducted at the
malt shop (I go back a long way)
after school.

That is to say, in the special
environment of a single-sex school,
a girl (and I presume a boy) can
begin to find out who she is, what
her capacities are. She does not
have to role play for young Mr.
Cool two aisles over. She does
not have to simper and posture
in order to protect her femininity
from innuendo and assault. She
can be herself. She can make
friends—close, warm friends—of
her own sex. On that last point,
there is a quality to the relation-
ships between girls at The Seminary
that is unique; I assume that is
true in other girls' schools.

By the age of fourteen—Seminary
begins at grade nine—a great many
girls have suffered a good deal of
damage at society's hands. For the
most part the intent was benign,
but the damage has been done.

They have had dolls thrust into
their hands, not trucks and erec-
tor sets. They've been taught
what it means to be "feminine"—
soft, amenable, cooperative, well-
behaved, dependent, helpless.
“Daddy's Little Girl"—sugar and
spice and everything nice. Asked
to dissect a fetal pig, they

say "Ugh!" and flutter their hands
nervously and feel queasy. They
have learned to defer to authority,
to suppress their opinions, to
harbor the notion that somehow
they will be taken care of the
rest of their lives. Another “
“Daddy" will appear, to take them
under his strong arm.

Schools like The Seminary can
do a great deal for girls who have
fallen into this pattern. Suddenly,
a girl finds herself in an environ-
ment in which she is expected to
achieve, to produce, to draw on
her own resources, to test herself
with the knowledge that if she
falls on her face she will be
picked up, dusted off, and sent
back into the situation again.

She is trained for leadership,
quite literally. ("Leadership
Training" is a requirement for
office-holding in the school.)
Small classes—those at Seminary
average ten students—make hiding
impossible. Activities abound,
and if a girl has any latent in-
terest (language, sports, science,
math, publications, chess, politics,
social service, drama), she will
be encouraged to develop it. A
school of 170 needs everybody's
contribution, and the size of most
girls’ schools is a tremendous
advantage for their students.

The Seminary philosophy is a
curious combination of kindly
nurturing and tough love. Girls
are encouraged to try, to fail
if they must, but to try. Passi-
vity is the cardinal sin at the
school. The girls are given a
great deal of responsibility for
their daily lives. The student
government is a real student
government. A Student Court takes
care of most disciplinary problems.
School rules are set by both Stu-
dent Council and faculty. An Honor
System prevails in academic matters.
There is a fair amount of structure,
but there is a good deal of elasti-
city to the structure, and usually
what is best for the individual
girl informs decisions.

We have our problems, and they
are most likely the problems of
girls' schools everywhere. It
is difficult to muster any sort
of crowd at athletic events, since
girls' athletics do not excite.
Hence students complain about what
they call lack of school spirit.
There is a continuing debate on
the faculty between authoritarian
elements and more permissive ones.
In their exuberance, the girls
are sometimes too noisy and messy
and careless and thoughtless for
people of another generation.

It is very hard sometimes to find
people to take male roles in
school plays. (Canisius has been
decent about providing. Brothers
turn out sometimes.) When a load
of firewood is delivered, the head-
master and the maintenance man
end up carrying most of it, and
it is difficult to find people
to take the other end of heavy
deliveries. For the most part,
though, we rub along all right.

I am not altogether sure that
I have said anything in this brief
exposition of a very complicated
topic. Those of us who have been
involved with all-girl education
for any length of time—I’ve been
here twenty-six years—feel in
our bones that there is a signif-
icant difference between what goes
on in a school like Seminary and
what goes on in the normal coedu-
cational school. We may be delu-
ding ourselves, but if we are,
we will have been doing so for
135 years. And by the way, let
me point out what astute readers
will: a woman should have written
this! But such are the constraints
of summer.

FAMILY CARE LEAVE BILL PASSES

The newly-named Family and
Medical Leave Act of 1986 would
require employers of 15 or more
people to grant them up to 18
weeks of unpaid leave over a
two-year period to care for ill
children or parents, and up to
26 weeks of leave over one year
in the event of the employee's
own serious illness.

Health care benefits would
continue during the leave period
and the employee would be guaran-
teed a return to her own job or
an equivalent position with no
loss of pay or benefits. The
bill includes a three-month
vesting period before the leave
could be requested.

STATE VOTES 10 MILLION FOR
FAMILY PLANNING INITIATIVE

The State Legislature over-
whelmingly approved Governor
Cuomo's budget request for
expanding State funding for
family planning from $4.18
million last year to $10
million in the fiscal year
that began April 1.

Cuomo, who has said that
as a Catholic he is primarily
opposed to abortions but cannot
make his religious beliefs
a part of public policy, said
that his administration supports
birth control as a means to
prevent unwanted pregnancy
despite moral objections from
some religious groups.

He was quoted as saying,
“Let's be generous, even
aggressive, about talking to
young people about their
options.

was no longer naive, and Prince
was part of a bittersweet memory,
the details of that homecoming
would remain clear. She would
remember her mother's face regis-
tering emotions ranging from
shocked disbelief to the joys of
anticipated revenge, each vying
for supremacy as she saw her
disfigured daughter enter the
kitchen on the arm of a man she
equated with Svengali.

Room temperature dropped ten
degrees with each word as Mother
asked with disquieting softness,
“What happened?"

"I think I must be allergic
to something," chirped Bedelia
nervously.

The silence was deadly as
Mother slowly looked from Bedelia
to Prince. Meeting his eyes she
murmured, "It must be genetic.”

WE NEVER HEAR THE MUSIC

From page 12

so much of what we who are women
have done in these areas for so
long.

5. Last, but not least, we should
all patronize programs which do
include women's music—traveling
miles to attend, buying the best
seats in the house, applauding with
“bring-down-the-rafters" enthusiasm
—and thus bringing so much neglected,
but well-crafted and eminently
listenable music into the mainstream.
