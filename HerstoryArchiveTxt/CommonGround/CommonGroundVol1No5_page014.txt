A riot of impatiens has come over the commons

A dog wandered through the impatiens, oblivious to the

riot, treading carefully among them, staying to the paths.

A scruffy old dog, it wore a flea collar. It sniffed but

minded its P's and Q's. Until it sniffed -- maybe a mole

and began to dig. The scruffy old dog was almost cunning

kneading the earth with freckled paws. I wondered if it

smelled a mole. The dirt flew fairly. The old dog at-

tracted a fair crowd of onlookers. One like me stayed --

she was about 12, had a broad braid down the back of her

head.

The old dog couldn't dig deep enough to get what—

ever it was after. That mother mole buried her young

Do you know I cried for you tonight? deep. The girl's grandpa didn't want to watch, but after

remembering my own years of inner bedlam - a while her grandma did. "Someone's going to murder you

you just have to wait over those flower beds, boy", said a female passerby.

but it’s scary waiting. Sarah Slavin

I cried for the waiting,
yours and mine.

I also cried
for the mirror

your words are to me.

I read them

and I think of all the times

in restaurants

we women THE NIGHT AND THE SEA
have trooped to the ladies' room
en masse,

and spent half an hour in there

trying to find ourselves : ; ? :
in each other's compacts. _ Shining, shimmering, beautifully.

The night looks so much like the sea,

So I write, my sister, Anne, With the clouds sliding smoothly

to try to keep my inner eye

somewhat focused

on that part of me

that bends toward you -
that aches with you -

and perhaps I'll detect

what ghostly thing it was

that tolled in your heart;

that ghostly thing

that preyed on you

as you stood waiting

in the dark.

Across the sky,

Similar to ocean life,

Always swimming by.

With stars as sparkling silver fish

And a crescent moon,

Like a broken shell. Se

Poet to Poet (for Joel Oppenheimer)

"Write a poem", says the poet
Limbs strong and gnarled with veins
Easy for him

He's spent his life dispersing words
They ring him wider each year
Deep-rooted in fertile soil, : 3 .
Tall from seeking sun,

He shows new colors in each season.

"Write a poem", I reply
Hard for me

Content to meander mutely underground

Energy spent in home and work

Safe-banked, so I thought

But banks erode and streams must find a mouth
The poet asks for words

I'll give him some.
