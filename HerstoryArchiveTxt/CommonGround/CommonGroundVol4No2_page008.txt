SEXISM IN THE BUFFALO NEWS

by Sharon Green

In 1983, Buffalo became a one
newspaper city. Gone are the days
of learning about an event from
two different perspectives, of
comparing reportage, and of reading
opposing editorials. Gone also is
the competition which keeps one
accountable.

Without the Courier-Express,

The Buffalo News is less apt to be
innovative or daring. As an avid
newspaper reader, I see that sexism
is still alive and well in our
paper. It's merely a bit more
subtle than before. As The News
drags its feet to improve its treat-
ment of women, I can't help but
wonder if their policies would be
altered more quickly if the Courier
were still around.

The News' most obvious sexist
practice is in the layout of the
paper. For instance, the "Sports"
section is still geared to men and
all the things in which men are
supposedly interested. So this
section contains most of the auto-
motive ads. Most women I know
own a car, and most of us assume
all or some responsibility for its
maintenance. Yet when I want to
find a sale on, say, wheel align-
ments, I'm annoyed to have to
search among ads for female strip-
pers.

A few years ago, The News acknow-
ledged that titling one section
the "women's pages" is blatantly
sexist. But the section now called
"Living" has been changed in name
only. It still contains household
hints, engagement and wedding an-
nouncements, human interest stories
and society notes.

Another change, which editor
Murray Light explained recently
in the paper, deals with using
titles for second and subsequent
references to people within an
article. The first time a man is
named, he is referred to as "Mr.
James Doe." Thereafter, his title
is omitted (as in "Doe also claimed
a case").

However, a woman's title is
used every single time her name is
mentioned throughout the entire
piece. Yet Light (or should I say
Mr. Light?) proudly boasted that
The News' new policy is to use the
title "Ms." (unless a woman specif-
ically requests "Miss" or "Mrs."),
as if to imply that the paper is
now liberal and up-to-date.

I see it differently. Repeated
use of "Ms." continues to set us
apart, to keep us from being treat-
ed the same. We're still being
put on a pedestal; it's just a
shorter one. (Not much shorter,
however. A recent check revealed
that The News will still not accept
engagement and wedding photographs
which include men.)

Interestingly, "Ms." is quickly
abandoned in the birth announcements.
That newfangled term is fine for
victims of crime or businesswomen,
but not for women having babies.

If a woman is not willing to use
"Mrs." along with her husband's
first name, then her child's birth
announcement cannot be printed.

To verify this, I wrote Mr.
Light that my surname and my hus-
band's are different, that my ap-

propriate title is "Ms.", and the
surname of our next child (a hypo-
thetical pregnancy) would be a
hyphenated version of both our
names. I also asked how single
women might have their babies’
announcements included.

His terse reply included the
following explanation: "We must
maintain a certain standard of
consistency in these announcements
because we do not have the time or
the manpower to separate out
those persons with special or un-
usual circumstances."

Judging from my daughter's nursery
school class list, which indicates
22% of the mothers have either
hyphenated or their original sur-
names, such circumstances aren't

so unusual anymore. But if you
don't conform to The News' patri-
archal customs, they can't help
you.

Also, his reply didn't even
speak to the issue of single mothers.
Clearly the taboo surrounding “un-
wed" mothers is still too hot to
handle. I feel sorry for those
single mothers in their 20s and
30s who proudly choose to bear a
child, but cannot have this an-
nounced.

My last grievance is one that
occurs only occasionally; but when
it does, it is offensive and even
inaccurate. The Buffalo News per-
sists in referring to female college
students as "co-eds."

The etymology of this word traces
back to the time when some institu-
tions of higher education were
all male. Later in their histories
they began to admit women. Today's
connotations of "co-ed," however,
are quite negative. The term sug-
gests that female students are
latecomers, that their career
goals are secondary to their search
for a husband, and even that they
are girls, not women.

Last spring, two women students
from Buffalo State College were
murdered en route to a Florida va-
cation. In reporting this incident,
The Buffalo News repeatedly called
them "co-eds." Not only was this
highly insensitive, it was also
incorrect, since Buffalo State
was not originally an all-male
institution.

All of these problems may seem
minor, but when they occur in the
only daily newspaper that most
Buffalonians read (not to mention
the other media), they have a sub-
liminal effect on our attitudes.
They pervade our consciousnesses,
and they reinforce limiting stereo-

types about both women and men.
Without local competition, The
News has certainly become lackadais-
ical in eliminating the vestiges
of its sexism.

In closing, I would like to dedicate
this column to Nancy Pliszka, who
along with her 3-year-old daughter
Eden Pliszka-Tillotson, was killed
suddenly in a car crash on August
3, 1985. An active Buffalo femin-
ist, she would have felt that such
issues are indeed important. After
all, she once penciled in “Femin-
ist" on her daughter's birth an-
nouncements. Nancy and Eden will
be missed by many.

EDUCATION

For those who cannot make a
commitment to a full degree pro-
gram, Trocaire College (South
Buffalo) is offering one-year
certificate programs. Included
are studies in surgical technol-
ogy, medical secretarial, busi-
ness secretarial, and legal sec-
retarial. For additional infor-
mation, call 826-1200, ext. 259.

The CHILD SUPPORT ENFORCE-
MENT AMENDMENTS OF 1984 are the
means through which Congress is
seeking to force states to aid
individuals in collecting support
payments. Among the enforcement
methods available are garnish-
ment, mandatory income withhold-
ing (can be used for current pay-
ments as well as those in arrears),
interception of federal and state
income tax refunds, child support
liens, bonds to secure support
payments, and mandatory report-
ing of payment defaults to
credit reporting agencies.

State laws must now be en-
acted to implement Congress’
Amendments. The ABA Child
Support Project is working in
this and other arenas such as
developing training programs,
providing technical assistance
to legislatures, commissions,
and other groups, and by pub-
lishing and disseminating
information.
