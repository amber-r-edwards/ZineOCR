potpourri

Many Buffalonians are familiar
with the engaging photographs of
local optometrist Milton Rogovin.
Earlier this year, his pictures
of people in their workplaces and
in their homes were exhibited at
the Albright-Knox Art Gallery.
This display provided the inspir-
ation for my column this month.
His work reminded me of many of
my own women friends who work at
salaried jobs outside the home.

If they had been the subjects of
Rogovin's work, their "at-home"
portraits would almost all include
children.

But pictures alone can only
hint at the daily lives of women
who work outside the home and who
also have children (especially
young children). The stress, the
problems, the occasional guilt,
and the sheer amount of work these
women endure are certainly not new
subjects in the popular media. In
fact, mass market periodicals, such
as Parents, Working Woman, and even
Women's Day, have gotten a lot of

mileage out of accounts of women
juggling family and career. These
sources have told us about women
sharing childcare and housework
with husbands or lovers, shopping
around for good daycare, living in
a less than perfectly clean house,
and losing sleep, but they have
still tended to overglamorize the
working mother.

Perhaps this is because they be-
lieve - and would have us believe -
that since we are able to go out to
work, we are truly liberated. I,
however, believe that working mo-
thers, in both social and capitalist
nations, are far from free. We now
have two jobs, one paid, and the
other unpaid, and often unacknow-
ledged. Most of us may get our
husbands to help, but the expecta-
tion is that it is still our re-

sponsibility to "get" them to "help."

Often if we didn't, they wouldn't.
(And this doesn't even begin to
touch the lives of single moms).
Don't let anyone kid you. Fewer

“My first job was teaching
school evenings at Niagara Com-
munity College when my boys were
pre-schoolers. When I'd leave,
they'd be looking out the front
window at me, and it was heart-
breaking. It was hard to tear
away from them, especially since
I was the only parent. I think I
often compromised with over-indul-
gence, especially with toys.

Eventually, I worked as a de-
signer at Artpark, so sometimes
they could come to work with me.
Since that was a daytime job, we
were able to do things together
in the evenings. Now that my sons
are older and we're all in school
together (Ken goes to Niagara Com-
munity College, and Greg will be
going to Niagara University), I
feel a new camaraderie with them.
We now have an intellectual rap-
port. Also, my boys have inspired
a lot of my artwork.

Finally, I'm very grateful that
we live upstairs at my mother's.
She has always been able to take
care of the boys while I worked."

it is still dark outside, changing
and bundling her up, scraping snow
off the car while she is inside cry-
ing, and then dropping her off at
daycare, not to be seen again until
evening - especially after only 5 or
6 hours of sleep.

So I think it is important to
meet a few of these women. And con-
trary to the media image, not all of
them are high-paid lawyers or busi-
nesswomen toting briefcases and clad
in business suits. Rather than de-
tail the difficulties of their lives
I have encouraged the women below to
focus on the positive. They will
tell us just how they manage their
two jobs.

Finally, my photographs in no way
purport to be of the quality of Ro-
govin's: my equipment is no doubt
simpler, and my skill is less artis-
tic. Instead, this photo essay is
intended to be a testament to the
strength and resourcefulness of
working mothers.
