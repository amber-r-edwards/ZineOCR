figures moving resolutely forward  
into Canada's unaccustomed cold,  
the snow betraying only one set of  
footprints. I use the word "naive"  
in its best sense: innocent, un-  
sophisticated. Sophistication  
would be incongruous in the con-  
text of a subject as fundamental  

as slavery.  

I think my favorite painting is  
No. 16. It shows a group of es-  
caped slaves hurrying along, their  
muffled footsteps almost audible.  
Bodies hunched forward in desperate  
speed, a foot raised here, another  
there, propel the group quickly  
along and give the viewer the sen-  
sation that it is she being hunted  
like an animal. An absence of  
faces, telltale dark skin hidden  
from view, adds a touch of furtive  
desperation, accentuated by the  
menace implied by the dark back-  
ground, sharply contrasting the  
fugitives' colorful garments.  

The personal story of Harriet  
Tubman is a testament to courage.  
She began working in her owner's  
house at the age of five. A re-  
bellious child, she was deemed un-  
suited for housework and as a  
consequence she was put to work  
in the fields doing hard physical  
work. At one point her skull was  
fractured by an overseer's blow,  
an injury that left her permanently  
subject to spontaneous states of  
deep sleep. This injury was to  
prove something of a blessing in  
disguise since the medical ignor-  
ance of the day led people to think  
she was mentally impaired, thus  
they underestimated her abilities.  

Unable to break her spirit by  
beatings or starvation the child  
was sold to the highest bidder, a  
Mr. George Carter. This was the  
owner from whom she escaped while  
in her early-twenties. She stole  
away one night and, navigating by  
the North Star, made her way up  
from Maryland, through Delaware  
and into New York State. It was  
essentially this route she tra-  
velled in her work for the under-  
ground railroad, continuing west  
on the return trip through Syracuse  
and Rochester, on to the Niagara  
Frontier and over the bridge to St.  
Catherines, Ontario. The added  
hardship of taking fugitive slaves  
to Canada was the direct result of  
President Millard Fillmore signing  
the Fugitive Slave Act in 1850,  

which required any American north  
of the Mason-Dixon Line to return  
runaway slaves to their owners.  

Moses, as Tubman was called,  
made nineteen trips to and from  
the Maryland area, bringing over  
300 slaves to freedom, carrying  
babies drugged with paregoric  
to keep them quiet, and threaten-  
ing the fainthearted with a small  
pistol she carried. "You can't  
go back now, you know too much.  
You continue on or I shoot you  
dead--right here." There was  
another reason for the pistol:  
she didn't intend to be captured  
alive by the bounty hunters who  
were offered $40,000 to bring  
her activities to an end.  

In 1861 Fort Sumter was fired  
on and the Civil War began.  
Moses was contacted by Governor  

Andrew of Massachusetts who asked  
her to serve as a spy and a scout  
for the Union forces, and, if  
necessary, as a nurse. Throughout  
the war she served the Union cause,  
getting some of her information  
from slaves on her sorties into  
Maryland, and using her fund of  
herbal lore to nurse Union casual-  
ties and cure the diseases that  
made military hospitals more dan-  
gerous than the front lines.  

When the war ended Harriet  
Tubman settled in Auburn, New  
York, where she continued to help  
her people through the Reconstruc-  
tion Period. She lived and died  
in poverty, her bravery and self-  
lessness ignored by the govern-  
ment she helped to preserve.  

It's hard to think of an artist  
better able than Jacob Lawrence to  
portray such a life as Harriet  
Tubman's. She considered her work  
as a religious calling: Lawrence  
views his art as a means of in-  
spiring his people to achieve the  
full potential of their heritage.  
He grew up in Harlem during the  
Harlem Renaissance of the 1920s  
when black history and black cul-  
ture were chronicled in black his-  
tory clubs, street orators preached  
black history on street corners,  
and exhibitions of black art at the  
New York Public Library gave a new  
generation of young black people  
an identity. The Harlem Museum  
of African Art and the Schomberg  
Collection, both of which were  
also located in the library, provi-  
ded a rich source of material for  
Lawrence's reading and inspiration.  

From 1938 to 1939 Lawrence was —  
employed in the Federal Art Project  
of the Works Project Administration,  
a period he feels was in-  
valuable to his artistic develop-  
ment. The style that evolved from  
his immersion in the black expe-  
rience is deceptively simple, direct,  
colorful and strangely moving.  

Unlike Harriet Tubman whose  
contributions to our country were  
unacknowledged during her lifetime,  
Mr. Lawrence has received many  
honors and today pursues his career  
in Seattle, Washington.  

The show continues through March  
2 at the Albright Knox Art Gallery.  
See it if you possibly can.

IDA B. WELLS  

REVIEW:  
MISS IDA B. WELLS  

by Sharon Green  

If you are interested in the true  
theatre, Black history, women's his-  
tory, or area playwrights, or all of  
the above, make a point of catching  
the final performance of Miss Ida B.  
Wells at the Center Theatre Cabaret,  
March 1st at 8 pm.  

Written by Endesha Ida Mae Holland,  

visiting professor and coordinator  

of the Third World Women's Component  
in American Studies/Women's Studies  

at U.B., this one-woman performance  
traces the life of civil rights acti-  
vist Ida B. Wells. Because most of  

us were taught very little about  

women and Blacks in U.S. history, this  
play begins to fill that gap.  

Born in 1862 in Mississippi, the  
oldest of 8 children, she became  
head of the household at 16 when  
her parents died of yellow fever.  
Her career began as a teacher, but  
soon an incident of racial discrim-  
ination on a train spawned her fight  
against racism. She eventually be-  
came a newspaper woman (no small  
feat for a Black woman in the late  
19th century), beginning by exposing  
the poor conditions in the school  
where she taught. Consequently  
she was fired from her teaching job.  

After witnessing the lynching of  
several Black businessmen in Memphis,  
she turned her writing and her energy  
into a crusade against these  
rampant racist lynchings. By the  
1890s, her feistiness and her dedi-  
cation to the belief that it was  
"right to strike a blow against  
evil" also led her to reach people  
through many public speaking engage-  
ments, including some in England.  
She also aligned herself with other  
prominent activists of the day such  
as Frederick Douglass, Jane Addams,  
and Susan B. Anthony. In the words  
of playwright Holland, Ida B. Wells  
had established herself "as a woman  
to be reckoned with."  

Local actress June Duell gave  
an engaging and warm performance  
as Ida B. Wells, although her  
delivery was at times faltering  
and soft-spoken. This began as  
a small scale performance in the  
Cabaret room of the Center Theatre.  
However, the unanticipated crowds,  
as well as the obvious need to  
project June Duell's voice through  
a microphone, suggest that this  
intimate setting could well have  
been sacrificed for the more accom-  
modating main stage of this theatre.  

During a post-performance open  
discussion, playwright Holland stated  
that this play stemmed from her  
interest in highlighting the achieve-  
ments of women in Mississippi, her  
own home state. Both she and director  
Ed Smith also view theatre as a  
medium for education as well as en-  
tertainment. Thus, I certainly  
hope they are able to act on the  
suggestion of several audience  
members to take this brief (under  
1 1/2 hours) and informative perform-  
ance to junior high and high schools,  
where students may still not be  
learning enough about women's his-  
tory and the history of those who  
fought racism.
