BREAST SELF-EXAMS  
UNPOPULAR  

Most American women are continuing  
to ignore the importance of breast  
self-examination for the early detec-  
tion of cancer, according to a Gallup  
survey for the American Institute of  
Cancer Research (AICR).  

Though 95% say they have heard of  
such exams, at least two thirds say  
that they do not perform them monthly:  
Only 30% practiced self-examination  
at least once in the past year.  

More than 37,000 women are expected  
to die of breast cancer this year,  
according to AICR. They also state  
that as many as 25% of such deaths  
could be avoided if the cancer is  
detected early enough.  

BLACK WOMEN HAVE  
LOWEST SUICIDE RATE  

The lowest suicide rates for adults  
in this nation are among the most  
disadvantaged people, states an ar-  
ticle in Modern Maturity. The lowest  
rate is held by old, poor, black  
females, though Gerontology researcher  
Dr. Rose Gilson does not have any  
firm theory on why this is so.  

"Black females may be more psycho-  
logically adjusted than their white  
counterparts," she speculates. "They  
may have learned early in life how  
to cope with hard times."  

FBI RECORDS ON LESBIAN  
AND GAY GROUPS WITHHELD  

The FBI has admitted that it has  
5,600 pages of records concerning its  
surveillance since 1950 of 13 lesbian  
and gay organizations including  
Daughters of Bilitis, Radical Lesbian  
Feminists, the Mattachine Society;  
and the National Gay Task Force. There  
was an application last fall for  
release of the documents under the  

NOT NECESSARILY  
IN THE NEWS  

International and military issues  
lead the list of under-reported news  
stories of 1983 according to a national  
panel of media critics, reported in  
Project Censored, a national media  
research project now in its eighth  
year, which locates stories about  
important issues not widely covered  
in new media. This year's ten top  
"censored stories," announced May  
30, 1984 by Project Director Carl  
Jensen, professor of Communication  
Studies at Sonoma State University,  
California, included little-covered  
USSR sweeping proposals for freezing  
nuclear weapons, media neglect of  
Nuclear Navy accidents, biological  
warfare research into recombinant  
(gene splicing) and other major  
stories. For the complete list with

presently un-reported stories in 1984,

HOUSEWIFERY IS  
HIGH STRESS SITUATION  

It is not the fact of having multi-  
ple roles such as wife, mother, and  
paid worker that causes the most  
stress on women, according to a recent  
story in the Buffalo News.  

A study reported at the recent  
American Psychological Association Con-  
vention in Toronto, paid work actu-  
ally has a beneficial effect that  
mitigates the stress in a woman's  
life which can be caused by her roles  
as a wife and mother.  

“The role of paid worker appears  
to be a source of self-esteem, pur-  
posefulness and inherent interest  
that may serve to mitigate the nega-  
tive effects of other (stresses) even  
under conditions of role conflict  
and role overload," said this report  
from two women from the Wellesley  

45% OF WORKFORCE  
IS FEMALE  

Women now make up 45% of the total  
workforce, according to a report from  
Women's Equity Action League. 62% of  
all women in 1981 who were aged 20-64  
either employed or looking for  
work. Two-thirds of all women workers  
are single, widowed, separated, di-  
vorced or have husbands who earn less  
than $15,000 a year. 52% of all wives  
are in the workforce.  

Women are still predominantly in  
clerical and service occupations,  
however. They make up 80.7% of cler-  
ical workers and 97% of private house-  
hold workers.  

Women make up 62% of all poor  
adults, and 70% of the elderly poor.  
The annual median income for adult  
women in 1982 was only $6,176 as com-  
pared to $14,667 for adult men.  
The Women's Action Equity League  
(WEAL) is a national, nonprofit mem-  
bership organization specializing in  
women's economic issues. WEAL con-  

ducts research and education projects,  
supports litigation, and lobbies.

LET  

Dear Common Ground,  

The week of October 8-14, 1984,  
will be Domestic Violence Awareness  
Week throughout the country. Initia-  
ted in 1980, this week is traditionally  
a time to heighten awareness to the  
problem, mourn those who have died as  
a result of abuse and celebrate with  
those who have made for themselves  
lives without violence. On the even-  
ing of October 8, NBC will air a made-  
for-television movie, "The Burning  
Bed." Adapted from Faith McNulty's  
book, this is the true story of an  
abused woman in Michigan who killed  
her husband, was brought to trial and  
acquitted.  

In the September issue, a list of  
crisis hotlines appears on page 8.  
Although numbers appear for the New  
York State Coalition Against Domestic  
Violence and programs in Niagara and  
Chautauqua County; ours does not.  
We'd appreciate your adding it; 884-  
6000 is a 24-hour domestic violence  
hotline for Erie County.  

Sincerely,  

Freedom of Information Act, but the  
FBI refused, saying that releasing  
the documents would “endanger national  
security” and that the public served  
was too "small" to warrant the search.  
The California Civil Liberties has  
filed a suit.  

AREA DISCRIMINATION  
SUITS: SOME GOOD NEWS,  
SOME BAD  

Significant progress has been made  
in the sex discrimination case brought  
against the Buffalo Psychiatric Center  
by local women. The suit has officially  
been granted class action status,  
which means, among other things,  
more than just the original women  
filing will be able to receive the  
benefits of back pay and other demands  
if the suit is successful. Also sig-  
nificant is the fact that a court  
decision has granted them permission  
to sue in State Supreme Court rather  
than having to go through the E.E.O.C.  

And now the bad news...the age  
and sex discrimination suit filed  
against the Holiday Inn has been  
denied.  

SHARKS ATTACK MORE  
MEN THAN WOMEN  

After reviewing the data on shark  
attacks at an Australian beach, a  
group of scientists found that men  
were attacked nine times more often  
than women, according to an article  
in Women's Sports. While there is  
little doubt that sharks are drawn  
to fresh blood, they seem to be re-  
pelled by hemolyzed blood, such as  
that discharged during menstruation.
