La Leche League Celebrates

by Eileen Basinski

Prior to the founding of  
La Leche thirty years ago,  
breastfeeding was practically  
a lost art. In this country  
bottle feeding was in its  
heyday and the culture at large,  
but particularly the hospitals  
had a widespread antipathy toward  
breastfeeding. With nowhere to  
turn for information and support,  
many mothers who wanted to nurse  
their babies met only frustration  
and failure when they tried. One  
afternoon at a church picnic in  
Illinois, nursing babies in arms,  
Mary White and Marion Thompson  
decided that there had to be a  
way to help their friends so that  
they too could enjoy the deep  
fulfillment of the nursing bond.  
They banded together with five  
other women and organized La  
Leche League, now an interna-  
tional organization with 4,000  
local chapters in 44 countries.  
Labelled “the world's foremost  
authority on breastfeeding" by  
the American Academy of Pediatrics,  
La Leche has helped hundreds of  
thousands of women worldwide to  
breastfeed and created a revolu-  
tion in nursing.  
La Leche's philosophy is that  
the woman of today can succeed  
at breastfeeding as well as the  
women of the past if they are pro-  
vided with moral support, practi-  
cal information and assurance!  
Unlike the women of the past,  
many mothers of today may have  
never seen a baby nurse, or even  
held one until their own child  
was born and they might not have  
friends or family who have success-  
fully nursed a baby. The league  
tries to meet these women's needs  
by providing personal help, mother  
to mother, with group leaders and  

members sharing personal experiences  

at regular meetings.  

League meetings are not classes,  
but informal discussions of the  
physical, psychological and medical  
aspects of breastfeeding held in  
the relaxed atmosphere of a member's

home. Each series consists of four  
meetings, once a month, each with  
its own topic: 1) the advantages  

of breastfeeding to mother and  
baby; 2) the art of breastfeeding  
and overcoming difficulties; 3) the  
baby arrives; 4) nutrition and wean-  
ing. The group leader shares her  
knowledge on each of these subjects  
and encourages mothers to ask ques-  
tions and share their experiences.  
For every question or difficulty  
that might be brought up, there are  
usually several mothers at the  
meeting to offer various suggestions  
or solutions. The discussions go  
far beyond breastfeeding and the  
more experienced mothers can pro-  
vide a wealth of information to  

the first-time mothers on child  
care. The toddlers group meets to  
discuss the "gentle guidance" of  
toddlers (La Leche's word for disci-  
pline) and many women who are no  
longer nursing continue to attend  
meetings because they enjoy social-  
izing with other mothers that they  
have so much in common with. Most  
league moms are also very inter-  
ested in nutrition and having got  
their babies off to the very best  
nutritional start in life by breast-  
feeding they try to continue in  
that vein. Mothers share recipes  
and homebaked goodies after the  
meetings.  

In addition to meetings, league  
leaders provide assistance to  
mothers with special needs, such  
as the mother of twins, the mother  
of a premature infant, the blind  
mother, and the mother who works.  
They are also available by phone  
twenty-four hours to help with  
any problems that may arise. I  
myself owe my success at breast-  
feeding my daughter to La Leche's  
telephone assistance and this  
article is my way of thanking the  
special women who helped me through  
the difficult early weeks of nursing.  
At the time I didn't know that my

extremely sore nipples would only  
last a few weeks or that two and  

a half hour feedings were my baby's  
way of establishing an adequate  
supply of milk. I do know that I  
came close to quitting breastfeed-  
ing, not because I wanted to, but  
because I didn’t think I had enough  
milk and I didn't know what I was  
doing.  

Now my baby is almost a year old  
and she's a happy, healthy, alert,  
active angel who tips the scales  
at twenty-four pounds. Every month  

she nurses less and less as she  
begins to eat solid foods and I  
treasure our quiet moments when  
she crawls in my lap to nurse,  
holding up her hand for a kiss  
and laughing while she hooks her  
finger between my lips. (Am I  
supposed to suck?)  

Now I'm a pro at breastfeeding,  
but I still regularly attend league  
meetings. It's exciting to see all  
the babies grow and change from  
month to month and Natalie enjoys  
meetings as much as I do. I like  
the women I meet at La Leche.  

They put people before things and  
go out of their way to find methods  
of child care that go beyond the  
uninformed traditions passed down  
by families. League also has a  
Professional Advisory Board made  
up of over forty professionals  

with expertise in all areas of  
breastfeeding and maternal-infant  
health. They publish numerous  
pamphlets dealing with a wide  
variety of topics related to  
breastfeeding, childbirth, parent-  
ing, nutrition, and distribute books  
on subjects from toilet training  

to starting a home career which  

I find most useful.  

Medical scientists have long  
acknowledged the nutritional super-  
iority of mother's milk. We also  
know that it helps prevent aller-  
gies and a multiplicity of infec-  
tions and aids in speech develop-  
ment among other things. It is  
only recently however that they've  
begun to explore the tremendous  
role of breastfeeding in the emo-  
tional development of a child and  
maternal-infant bonding. In his  
foreword to THE WOMANLY ART OF  
BREASTFEEDING, La Leche's breastfeeding  
manual, Dr. Herbert Ratner  
says, “Only now are we beginning  
to grasp the extent to which the  
undermining of the maternal attach-  
ment process with its reciprocal  
bonding of infant to mother has  
contributed to the maternal and  
adult delinquency of a sick society."  
When breastfeeding again becomes  
the accepted mode of infant feed-  
ing, mothers and infants will be-  
come bosom friends and all society  
will reap the benefits.  

If you would like to join La  
Leche League or you have a friend  
who is expecting, feel free to  
contact any of the leaders of the  
Buffalo-Tonawanda chapter regarding  
the time and location of  
meetings nearest you. They are:  
Ginny (824-7318), Joan (875-4239)  
and Debbie (741-3646).
