Coast, and they [the Miskitos] did  
their own thing and everything  

was fine. Well, the Sandinistas  
came in and they said we're going  
to unite the country. They had a  
literacy campaign within six months  
after coming into office. They  
used the school children to teach  
people to read and they raised  

the literacy rate to 80% within a  
few months. They came to the At-  
lantic Coast too, but they taught  
them all how to read Spanish. There  
are four languages on the Atlantic  
Coast, there's Suma, Rama and Mis-  
kito which are the three Indian  
groups and they all speak English.  
But Spanish is not one of their  
languages, and they don't care to  
have it imposed on them.  

I think a lot of it [the diff-  
erences] is cultural, not politi-  
cal. There's definitely a Ladinos  
superiority complex. The Spanish  
came and they conquered and they  
were better than the Indians, they  
just knew it. The people who in-  
termarried with the Spanish and  
took on the Spanish culture, the  
Ladinos, are quite conscious of the  
fact they bear the superior culture,  
and that people who didn't do that  
are not quite up to them. And  
when they came to the Atlantic  
Coast they were very kind of their  
poor, benighted, heathen brothers  
and they endeavored to uplift them  
and civilize them which the poor,  
benighted, heathen brothers did not  
care for at all. They thought they  
were just fine the way they were.  
The schools were a real problem  
which is something they're trying  
to change now. They're going into  
bilingual education next year.  

JG: Bilingual for the Miskitos or  
everybody?  

RB: For everybody. They're going  
to teach English and Spanish in the  
schools. The Atlantic Coast is very  
different from the rest of Nicaragua.  
In [the west of] Nicaragua they  

have Spanish architecture. In Blue-  
fields, not only is the name of the  
place an English name, but the hous-  
ing looks just like something out  

of New England or Georgia. The  
houses are white clapboard with  
large verandas. The people speak  
calypso English and the population  
is mostly black which I hadn't  

known at all. They are the des-  
cendants of the slave trade, which  
existed all up and down the Atlan-  
tic Coast, not just in Nicaragua  

but everywhere. They are the same  
people that you find in Jamaica.  
They have the culture of the Mis-  
kito Indians since they inter-  
married with the Miskitos, but they  
look just like the black people in  
the U.S. They are being conscript-  
ed to fight in the war and they  
don't feel it's their war. They  
don't really feel part of the whole  
Nicaraguan culture. We heard over  
and over what is wrong with the go-  
vernment is they are drafting our  
kids. One man told us that they  
couldn't even have a high school  

that year because all the high  
school kids who were around the age  
to get drafted had all fled the  
country.  

JG: What is their draft age?  

RB: Fifteen, I think.  
It's very young.  

JG: Is that because they don't  
have enough older people?  

RB: It's a country of young people.  
JG: Talk about the children.  

RB: I've never seen so many young  
people. Part of it is because of  
the extraordinarily high birth  

rate but that's true in all of Cen-  
tral and South America. I think  
the difference in Nicaragua is that  
the war has really wiped out the  
population. An enormous number of  
people were killed in the war. It's  
like in this country if a million  
people were killed; proportionately  
that's what happened. Also, with  
all this health care, the babies  
that used to die don't. The child-  
ren are much different from our  
children. That's funny to say.  
When I got to the Newark airport  

I heard this woman snap at her lit-  
tle kid and it occurred to me that  
all the time I was in Nicaragua I  
never heard anybody snap at a child.  
And when I mentioned this to my  
brother who is a reporter in Nic-  
aragua he said, "You never will;  
they don't." I realized that the  
difference is that the children  
there are much more low key than  
American children. They're not de-  
manding. I mean, they run and play  
but they don't seem to demand so  
much attention. There are children  
everywhere you look. We went into  
the sewing machine place where the  
women were working and there were  
small children all around them. I  
saw a barber cutting a man's hair  

and as he walked around the chair  

his little son who was about three  
was clinging to his knee.  

The very young are armed. In  
fact, everybody there is armed,  
they're armed to the teeth. I  
never saw so many people armed.  

And yet they're not a warlike peo-  
ple at all. You have an odd sense  
of their being a very peaceful peo-  
ple. Partly, I suppose it's because  
the children are raised in a very  
peaceful, loving atmosphere. But,  
they're scared to death of us.  

JG: Tell why they think we're go-  
ing to invade any minute.  

RB: We've been playing our war  
games on the border in Honduras.  
We've got all these planes and  
equipment there and we've been  
building these airstrips and it's  
really the equivalent of our having  
3 million Russian troops massed  
on the Canadian and Mexican bord-  
ers. That's the equivalent percen-  
tage-wise of the amount of troops  
we have massed on the Nicaraguan  
borders and I have a feeling that  
if there were 3 million Russian  
troops on the Canadian and Mexican  
borders the people in the U.S.  
would be very paranoid, especially  
if they flew reconnaissance flights  
over Nicaragua daily. They really  
think we're going to attack.  
They've also lost an enormous  
number of their people in the fight-  

ing since the revolution, in the  
Contra attacks. In Managua they  
have bomb shelters built. The civ-  
ilian population is all armed. They  
had a demonstration and everybody  
came with guns. That was funny be-  
cause we had talked to the man at  
the American Embassy and he was  
telling us that the government -  
the Sandinistas - were very unpop-  
ular. And I said that the NRA [Na-  
tional Rifle Association] is always  
telling us that the best defense  
against Communism is an armed pop-  
ulace and I had never seen a more  
armed populace than right here in  
Nicaragua. The man agreed. I've  
never heard of a totalitarian gov-  
ernment that could afford to arm  
its civilians. I mean, let's be  
sensible about it. If you're un-  
popular you do not arm the civil-  
ians. He agreed with that but he  
said, "Well, they're popular now  
but they're losing popularity and  
they know it. They have built this  
reinforced concrete stand to speak  
from behind for [Daniel] Ortega,  
the President. He speaks from be-  
hind this now whereas he used to  
speak out in the open." A week  
later I saw that this wasn't true.  
They had a demonstration - it was  
right after Reagan's speech about  
how they had to be overthrown -  
and Ortega spoke with Sergio Ram-  
irez, the Vice-President and Hum-  
berto Ortega, who's the Minister  
of Defense. They stood up there  
surrounded by thousands of people  
carrying guns. It would have been  
very easy - at the end there were  
firecrackers - to cover the sound  
of gunfire. And Ortega and Ram-  
irez and Humberto Ortega stood up  
there on an open platform with no  
protection whatever and made long  
speeches. It didn't seem to me  
that this was a government which  
was scared of its own people. It  
would have been awfully easy to  
kill them if anybody had wanted to.  

Actually the U.S. embassy was  
kind of funny. The embassy spokes-  
person was a type, a type that  
we've all met, a salesman. He was  
an affable man, pleasant, friendly.  
No matter what we said he agreed  
with us. People would say that the  
Contras were killing civilians and  
he'd say yes, indeed, that's what  
war is like. We said our govern-  
ment is trying to undermine their  
government with economic blockades  
and he said, “No, that's not true.  
The U.S. is the biggest customer  
for Nicaraguan goods." Then some-  
one pointed out that it's not the  
U.S. government but private cit-  
izens who've been buying these  
goods and in fact the U.S. govern-  
ment has been doing its damnedest  
to stop it.  

We asked him about the Nicar-  
aguan elections because the world  
press had said great things about  
the Nicaraguan elections. The  
American press was saying great  
things until Reagan pulled out his  
Russian MIGS story. That took the  
election news off the front page  
and a week later they turned out  
that, gee whiz, they weren't Rus-  
sian MIGS after all, but the damage  
had been done. But the rest of  
the world press reported that the  
Nicaraguan elections were extra-  
ordinarily fair; that they had  
bent over backwards to make the  
elections fair.
