EMMA is looking brighter and  
better every day. Our September  
artist space was filled by Jane  
Jacobson who exhibited her beautiful  
stained glass pieces. The reception  
of September 10 was a great success.  

Another part of our new look is  
a totally rearranged store. We have  
more room for stock and more room  
for community activities. Many  
thanks to Hope Hoetzer for an  
attractive design and some back-  
breaking labor.  

Get your holiday shopping done  
early this year! EMMA will be  
carrying calendars from 30 different  
women artists. You can get in on  
the pre-paid record and calendar  
order too!! Drop by the store and  
take a peek at what is available.  

The local chapter of the National  
Organization for Women has a lot of  
new items on sale at EMMA: T-shirts,  
nightshirts, notecards, buttons and  
more to let the world know what you  
think!  

A local writer and a good friend  
of EMMA has just sent her second  
novel off to be published! Ruth  
Geller's book has been accepted by  
Crossing Press, so watch EMMA's  
shelves for this.  

We are looking for women artists  
and craftswomen. We need artists to  
fill the gallery space. You can ex-  
hibit your work for one month for  
free and we'll throw you a party.  
Craftswomen can sell their work on  
consignment at EMMA--call the store  
at 885-2285.  

Students--don't forget our lending  
library. We have some valuable  
resource materials. Teachers can  

order course books through the  
store, too. Get next semester’s  
order in now.  

Keep a look-out for a coffee-  
house/fundraiser presently in the  
works. Interested musicians and  
poets should call the store.  

Thanks to all the women and  
their pets who participated in the  
EMMA/Common Ground run. At this count  
we raised $226. But what we all  
want to know is who owns that alter-  
native-looking dog in the red EMMA  
T-shirt?  

GAY AND LESBIAN COMMUNITY CENTER  
FUND DRIVE  

The Gay and Lesbian Community  
Center, recently relocated in a  
beautiful three-story building at  
647 West Delevan Avenue in Buffalo,  
is seeking all interested people  
to help with their Founders’ Fund  
Drive to raise $11,000 by January  
2, 1984 to purchase the house.  

So far, response to their  
fund drive has been encouraging.  
They have started a Founder's  
club of people and organizations  
who have donated $100 each to the  
building fund. The building  
they are purchasing is a three-  
story house, with 5 separate con-  
ference rooms, a full kitchen, and  
a third floor that could be  
developed into meeting space.  
Many local groups are already  
using the space to meet, such  
as the AIDS Taskforce, Gay Youth  
Advisory Board, Metropolitan  
Community Church, 5th Freedom,  
the Buffalo Gay and Lesbian  
Library, and others.  

The G.L.C.C. is also looking  
for other people to donate $5 -  
$10 - $15 -- whatever they can --  
to help realize their dream of  
a community center.  

Common Ground agreed to  
assist G.L.C.C. in publicizing  
their fund drive, and to that  
end, we will give up to one  
page of space in our paper to  
list the name of, or a message  
from, each person who gives $5  
to the G.L.C.C. Fund Drive.  
$5 buys you one line (36 charac-  
ters and spaces). This can be  
a visible way of showing your  
support for the Center.  

If you would like to  
participate in the fund drive,  
send your check (made out  
to G.L.C.C. Friends Fund),  
and indicate the number of lines  
you are purchasing, one line, $5,  
two - $10, three - $15 etc., and  
print exactly what you would like  
printed in the paper. You must  

sign your name, even if you wish  
to remain anonymous. Send it to  
G.L.C.C., P.O. Box 1595, Ellicott  
Sta., Buffalo, New York. Indicate  
on your check and on the sheet with  
the lines you are purchasing, that  
it is for Common Ground publi-  
cation.

CONCLUSIONS  

Uses of the word pornography itself  
made the discussion difficult. It is  
a value-laden, and at the same time,  
generic sort of word. While some peo-  

ple in "the trade" use the word, others  

do not and refer instead to ‘adult  
bookstores', ‘X-rated movies', the  
"sex magazines". It is those outside  
the industry and against it who most  
often use the word pornography, always  
in a negative sense. No wonder defi-  
nition of terms becomes difficult.  

The audience and panelists seemed  
to be using the term in at least two  
interchangeable ways: to describe  
something they found offensive, vio-  
lent or obscene; or to describe the  
generalized topic of sex-related mater-  
ial, whether or not to them it was  
violent or objectionable. Unfortunate-  
ly, it is sometimes used interchange-  
ably in this article as well, but,  
generally it is used to define the  
genre, not as a value judgement on the  
material.  

Audience reaction after the session  
broke up was mixed, but we felt many  
people left frustrated that the group  
did not come to a definition of terms.  
There was no clear agreement that por-  
nography, although not limited to,  
includes violence, objectification and  
domination.  

Two women were overheard complain-  
ing that it was too intellectual a  
discussion of a topic which immediately  
touched their lives. One said that  
the issues of choice and freedom of  
speech and privacy were important but  
she was frustrated that there was so  
little discussion of violence against  
women.  

As a forum for discussing the issue,  

the evening was very successful. It  
was impossible to expect that anything  
conclusive would come out of it.  

COMMON GROUND would like to invite  
our readers to respond to or clarify any of the  
issues raised by the movie and discussion,  
and by this article.  
Please send a SASE for a style sheet and info if  
you are planning to write.
