Holly Near is one of those  
special artists whose live per  
formances make converts out  
of nearly everyone. Her per  
sonal charisma is captivating,  
her broad-based, socially  
conscious songs absorbing.  

Regan McMahon, BAM  
Bay Area Music Magazine  

The key to the success of  
Near's show is that she has  
the performance skills and  
vocal range to keep from being  
overshadowed by her material.  
Her radiant personality and  
crafty sense of humor gave  
the set an uplifting, affirm  
ative spirit. —Paul Grein,  
Los Angeles Times  

“Near possesses one of the  
most pure and moving voices in  
pop music. It's hard not to laugh  
and cry at various times because  
Near's delivery is that moving.”  
Larry Kelp, Oakland Tribune  

“Romantic ballads by singer Holly  
Near can be as lyrical as Anne  
Murray, as earnest as Joni Mitchell  
or as torchy as Barbra Streisand.”  
Nancy Faber, People Magazine  

“She melts her extraordinary  
soprano over candlelight mini-  
atures of very private passions  
and protests. Then, as a spy  
of the heart, Holly Near  
makes sense to everybody  
in the neighborhood.” —Laura  
Fissinger, Rolling Stone  

“Becoming one of the most influential  
artists in the country.” —Jane F.  

“It’s probably no coincidence that at the same  
time that the Pied P. of the Political Left  
was making peace with her divided fol-  
lowings, the mainstream media jumped in  
and began to claim Near as its Favorite  
Daughter. From 1970 on, Near for  
her musical career, packed concert  
halls, and sold some 250,000 albums  
totally outside the mainstream music  
industry.” —Susan Wilson, City Limits  

“Holly Near is a riveting per-  
former with an amazing  
voice, but most of all  
she manages to move  
people while singing  
about what she  
believes in. She is  
the only person I  
know who has suc-  
cessfully com-  
bined music  
and politics.”  
—Bonnie Raitt  

“By some  
merging mir-  
acle of art and  
fate, Near has  
become one of the  
select persons of our  
time to give us a piece of  
ourselves with every song  
she sings. The music is so uni-  
versal that anyone who allows  
themselves to be touched by it  
most certainly will be.” —Jeff  
Jaisun, Journal-American
