WNY WOMEN FOUND |
PUBLISHING COMPANY

By Kay Patterson

Margaret Daughters, Inc. is a new,
Buffalo-based, feminist publishing
company inspired by such women as
Lavinia Dock, Lillian Wald and
Margaret Sanger.

That these names are not commonly
known is exactly the point, according
to Margaretdaughters' partners Charlene
Eldridge Wheeler and Peggy L. Chinn.

Dock, Wald and Sanger were nurses
whose work was largely ignored, re-
vised or attributed to men.

Wheeler and Chinn, both of whom
are nurses, have a "deep love of
history and a distrust that what we read
is accurate," Wheeler said.

"We need to go back to the original
sources (of the work of Dock, Wald,
and Sanger, in particular). What
they wrote and said is vastly differ-
ent from what they were reported to
have said."

This set Wheeler and Chinn think-
ing about the availability of feminist
thought in current nursing lit-
erature.

"We've been sharing things we've
written with people, nurses especial-
ly, but we were concerned that there
is no real feminist literature in
nursing," Wheeler said.

"That's because there's no place
to get published," Chinn added.

From that base emerged the idea
that the two could create their own
publishing company to specialize in
works by and about feminist nurses.

They consider it a preventative
measure. If the history of this
period of time is to be more accurate
than that of preceding periods, they
said, feminists must not allow their
work to become lost or misrecorded.

Between them, Wheeler and Chinn
had editing experience, writing skills,
graphic arts skills and a word pro-
cessor. Creating a publishing
company didn't seem out of the ques-
tion.

They played with the idea for
several months. Then came a critical
moment. In March, feminist nurse
Wilma Scott Heide came to Buffalo to
speak for International Women's Day.
She was looking for a publisher for
a book she had written.

When Chinn and Wheeler mentioned
their publishing company idea, Heide
took it seriously and talked with
them about publishing her book.

"We decided if that was really a
possibility, maybe we should go for-
ward with it," Chinn added.

In May, they came up with the
name of the company, in June they
incorporated and decided to publish
their own work on feminist process
on August 6th.

They signed a contract to
publish her book with Heide.

The name Margaretdaughters is a
tribute to their mothers, both of
whom are named Margaret.

"It is from them that we got our
enterprising natures, our inquiring
minds and our will to survive,"
Wheeler said. "Whether women survive
in spite of their mothers or because
of them, we owe them. Mothers are
silent figures and it feels really
good to have a tribute to them."

They expressed the tribute to
their mothers in a joint letter
announcing the birth of the company.

In part, that letter said, "know
in your heart of hearts, that Margaretdaughters
is a tribute to the gifts
that you have so freely given - your
insights, your creativity, your
enterprising nature, your support
and nurturance. These are marvelous
gifts. Every daughter should be so
fortunate as to be able to serve tri-
bute to the one individual who made
it all possible - her mother."

As an expression of their own com-
mitment to feminist process, Chinn
and Wheeler are developing contracts
with book writers that express a
collegial relationship between the
writer and publisher.

“We have tried to frame a contract
that comes from a feminist ethic
rather than a ‘power-over' ethic,"
Wheeler said.

Standard publishing contracts, for
instance, give primary powers for re-
vising works to the publishers. They
also require the writer not to pub-
lish similar works with other publish-
ers but do not hold the publisher to
refraining from publishing similar
works. The Margaretdaughters con-
tract will stipulate revision respon-
sibilities are shared, as is the re-
sponsibility not to threaten the fi-
nancial success of the work.

For Chinn and Wheeler, Margaretdaughters, 
Inc. is the realization
of “that dream we all chase of doing
work that you're good at, enjoy
doing and needs to be done.”

Peace and
Power

The first publication of Margaretdaughters, 
Inc., is Peace and Power:
A Handbook of Feminist Process.

The book, written by Chinn and
Wheeler, is scheduled to be marketed
in mid-October and will sell for $4.95.

They describe it as a "handbook
for putting feminist ideals into group
action.”

It outlines an alternative to tra-
ditional meeting formats. That alter-
native uses consensus decision-making,
rotation of the "chairwoman" function
of the meeting, a "check-in" time to
attend to individual needs and crit-
icism/self-criticism of the meeting.

Examples of typical group meeting
situations and solutions are pre-
sented.

The book will be available at
EMMA: Buffalo Women's Resource and
Cultural Center.

Scheduled for publication by the
fall of 1985 is Wilma Scott Heide's
Feminism for the Health Of It, a work
that proposes that feminism is a
values transformation that must occur,
regardless of a person's gender, if
health is to be achieved.

ARTS
de SCRIPT:

Crossing the
Spectrum

by Diane C. Prochownik

The premier performance of Arts de
Script on June 24th, 1984, returned
the rainbow of variegated cultural
entertainment to the Buffalo scene -
a rainbow that has been sorely missed
since the last of Dolores Rossi

Script's Imalog series was presented
in January, 1984. Like its prede-
cessor, Arts de Script is conceived
as a performance comment on the
universal experience of its originator, "The
eyes that hear, ears that see, touch
that shapes, a voice that envisions
and a soul that knows."

Combining poetry, music and a
theater segment, devoted this night
to the art of storytelling, Arts de
Script #1 presented a scintillating
evening at Mr. Goodbars Upstairs. A
new innovation was the Art Exhibition
available for viewing before the per-
formance.

Featuring the work of
Toni Paterson, a professor of Phil-
osophy at SUCB, her pulsing oils in
gem clear colors were influenced by
the work of the Renaissance philo-
sopher, Giordano Bruno, and his theory
of Cosmic Metabolism - a theory that
deals with the attributes of God/
Nature as infinite.

The visual imagery served to en-
hance the verbal imagery created by
George V. Tomashevich, when he read
his own poems and the translated
works of his compatriot, Mustafa
Jahic. Mr. Jahic, who currently re-
sides in Toronto, is an award-winning
Bosnian Yugoslav poet, whose work has
appeared internationally. Rich with
texture and intense feeling, Mustafa
Jahic's short pieces ranged from an
accolade to his adopted city to
poignant remembrances of his home-
land. Dr. Tomashevich, a poet/phil-
osopher and professor of Anthropolo-
gy at SUCB, called on his own back-
ground with selections that explored
man's purpose and humanism in his
search for meaning. Thought provok-
ing and deeply questioning, George
Tomashevich works with rhyme and
meter, often inserts touches of
humor and, on this occasion, also
offered a prose poem with an espec-
ially lyrical quality.

The musical segment, presented by
the cello and guitar duo of Peter
Kurzdorfer and Kim Cady, offered
original vocals based on their own
music, a Bach fugue and a composi-
tion written to accompany the words
of an Ogden Nash ditty. Extremely
versatile, the highlight of their
performance was their musical adapt-
ation of the Dolores Rossi Script poem,
"Log the Eagle's Flight,” a powerful
piece which, in turn, created a
powerful song.

The delightful storytelling of
Nancy McBride French has been pre-
sented to audiences that range from
children to senior citizens, and her
program covered a combination of
fairytale-based tales and contempor-
ary humor. Extremely expressive,
with a gift that held her audience
at rapt attention, she evoked the
same laughter and groan responses
common to story listeners of all ages
when a magical web of words is so
expertly woven.

Dolores Rossi Script, the origi-
nator, coordinator and guiding force
behind the successful, year-long
Imalog series and its successor, Arts
de Script, is a woman who uses her
experiences as a woman to generate
poetry that touches the heartstrings.
Calling upon her own ethnic heritage
and her roles as girl child, wife,
mother and creatively motivated indi-
vidual, Dolores writes pieces as
fragile as her moving "China Roses”,
a nostalgic remembrance of childhood,
and as forceful as "Cosmic Centurion",
based on the strength and the courage
of the search for centering goals be-
yond mere existence.

Arts de Script #1 is just the be-
ginning. Watch the Common Ground
calendar for upcoming dates of future
performances. We welcome you back to
the Buffalo scene.
