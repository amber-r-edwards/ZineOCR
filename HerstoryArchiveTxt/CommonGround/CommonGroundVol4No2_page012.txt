STRONG SUN MOON

On July 19 this year (1985),  
Daphne and her friend Karen traveled  
South to visit Lily Dale in Chautau-  
qua County, New York, a spiritualist  
community founded in 1879. In  
earth astrology, July 19 is under  
a strong sun moon. That this was  
a magical day became apparent as  
we came into close relationship  
with the land. We had stopped  
alongside old route five and walked  

the length of a small meadow, bounded  

on two sides by woods and thickets,  
to look out over Lake Erie. Roots  
splayed out of and over the layers  

of slate jutting above the lakeshore.  

Numerous wildflowers played in the  
woods and grasses. The previous  
months had brought ideal conditions  
for a bumper wildflower crop; the  
western New York winter had begun  
late and once begun, showered us  
with huge amounts of snow and  
thereafter, many rainy days inter-  
spersed with sunny ones.  

Ribwort grew cattail-like and  
plentifully, its 'tails' surrounded  
by spiky clouds of minute blooms.  
Purple-flowered self-heal and red  
clover ranged wildly underfoot, and  
chicory and Queen Anne's lace  
stood to our knees, the lavender-  
blue of the chicory flowers pierc-  
ingly clear. Little ox-eye daisies  
and field buttercups bobbed back  
and forth on thready stalks. If  
you ever decide to gather a handful  
of buttercups, by the time you  
get home, you will find them un-  
able to stand upright in a vase  
unless you have one especially  
designed for wildflowers. If you  
have small children, do not bring  
buttercups inside because they  
are toxic.  

Currant bushes in the woods glowed  
with berries. At the thicket's  
edge stood bittersweet in royal  
purple and yellow flower, its oval  
berries red and a bit dull. Next  
to the bittersweet stood dogrose,  
a wild version of sweet briar.  

The dogrose bushes were tangled  
with five-petaled violet-red flow-  
ers, buds and hips, finely drawn  
in groups (inflorescences) of  
three. Slender thorns grow on  
the dogrose stalk—herbalist Maud  
Grieve tells us the name 'dogrose'  
likely derives from "Dag Rose,"  
the "dag" standing for dagger.  
More apparent than thorns on this  
herbaceous shrub were clusters of  
what looked like small starfish,  
in reality fine five-cleft 'calyx'  
leaves (also called sepals), set  
atop the hips surrounding the car-  
pels. As are those of the butter-  
cup, the carpels of dogrose are  
commonly called compound pis-  
tels; botanists consider them a  
modified leaf. You can see them  
at the center of the single whorl  
or tier of petals on the dogrose  
flower. Once the five petals fall,  

the hips beneath the yellow carpels.

—the hypanthium—grow, reddening  
and after falling in the fall, be-  
coming fleshy. There are seeds  
within the hips; these ripen in  
the fall for dispersal by birds.  
The seeds within a hip qualify it  
for the designation, fruit, because  
a fruit, edible or not, is what  
encloses a plant's seeds. Most  
properly, though, the rose hip is  
a false fruit: it contains many  
one-seeded, hairy fruits.  

The rose bush proper is a pre-  
historic shrub, perhaps 30 million  
years old. Ancient frescoes found  
on Crete, including Knossos, depict  
roses; and Hatshepsut, the only  
pharaoh who was female, grew them  
during the Egyptian sixth dynasty.  
A Centifolia, the dogrose (Rosa  
canina) was seemingly unknown before  
the 1500s; and the origin of the  
Centifolias generally is not known,  
although they are considered Dutch  
in derivation. As plant communi-  
ties develop, the wild roses with  
broom, for example, introduce a  
shade habitat, which with the  
creeping thymes and similar plants  
improves the soil's ability to  
hold water. Heightened, this cap-  
illary potential in the soil is a-  
vailable for use by plants and a  
significant contribution to a  
plant's overall habitat, one aspect  
of the larger ecosystem. The hip-  
rose or witches’ briar, as dogrose  
is also called, naturalizes in  
field and thickets and is an im-  
portant member of the plant com-  
munity.  

The dogrose along with sweet  
briar and salt spray rose is also  
a contributor to the human commun-  
ity's welfare, because its hips  
have a high vitamin C content and  
have long been drawn upon as one  
source of C supplement. Drying  
the hips under optimal conditions  
will yield about two-thirds of  
their vitamin C; boiling them will  
yield much less. Short of eating  
them raw, as some Native Americans  
have done, drying is a simple  
process. Keep in mind that too  
much heat will destroy the vitamin.  
The whole ripe (not overripe) hips  
may be dried by the heat of the  
pilot in a gas oven or the light  
in an electric oven. Place them  
on trays on the oven door, and  
do not extend the process unneces-  
sarily. Store the dried hips in  
brown glass jars in a cool, dry  
place, and use as soon as possible.  
The vitamin C content of the hips  
will diminish with age, indeed,  

began diminishing when the hips  
ripened. Because vitamin C inter-  
acts with oxygen (oxidizes), it  

is unstable, and its preservation  
deserves careful attention. This  
is especially so since we humans  

cannot produce (biosynthesize) C  
in our bodies. Yet our bodies  
depend on C in numerous ways.  

Despite controversy over dosage,  
it seems that in many cases, ex-  
ceeding the Recommended Daily  
Allowance (RDA) of 60 mg for an  
individual of 15 years or more is  
beneficial. Mega-doses will not  
fix everything; and Daphne does  
not recommend them. But, modern  
living conditions—whether reduced  
income, chronic disease, smoking,  
coffee consumption or prescription  
or nonprescription drugs—and even  
physical variations from person  
to person may heighten a person's  
need for vitamin C. Magnesium  
apparently is a helpful companion  
to C but in smaller amounts (one  
authority suggests 0.15 g three  
times a day) than C (recommended  
by the same authority is perhaps  
1.0 g three times a day). One  
way to supply this C is by pulver-  
izing the dried hips at the time  
of use and adding them to food.  
The amount of C in the hips at the  
time of use will vary; and you do  
not necessarily want to take 3.0  
g of vitamin C daily. Consultation  
with a professional nutritionist  
or nutrition-oriented health pro-  
fessional (admittedly, hard to  
find) can be most important in  
establishing an adequate level of  
C in a person's diet. And, fresh  
foods with significant C content,  
such as citrus fruit and parsley,  
can and should be regulars in our  
respective diets.  

But, the mystery of the day—  
this day of days that Daphne and  
Karen made their ways to Lily Dale  
and most importantly, out of the  
city and onto the land.... What of  
the mystery? Sun Bear and Wabun  
tell us that the plant standing  
for Strong Sun Moon is the wild  
rose, and that  

according to a Mohawk herb-  
alist, there is an Indian  
prophecy that says that  
after the Europeans came to  
this continent there would  
be a great need for a cure  
for malignancies that would  
otherwise cause the downfall  
of their civilization. This  
cure for cancer would come,  
says the prophecy, from a  
hybrid rose developed by a  
person of Indian descent.  

Prophecies have a way of coming  
into being in unexpected ways. The  
obvious answer is never obvious.  
This is the mystery of the day,  
manifest, surely, in the lifting  
of worries that we experienced and  
in the light-as-a-breeze feeling  
connected to Lily Dale. This,  
then, is the "red-flowered Dogs-  
Rose or Hep-Tree."
