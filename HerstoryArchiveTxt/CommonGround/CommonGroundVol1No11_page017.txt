AN EVENING WITH VIRGINIA APUZZO  

Virginia Apuzzo, executive director  
of National Gay Task Force, was in Buf-  
falo June 1 to kick off Gay Pride Month.  
And kick it off she did - Apuzzo is  
a dynamic speaker who was frequently  
interrupted by applause that evening.  

She began by explaining she did not  
want to throw a lot of heavy facts at  
the audience or to lecture them about  
a particular topic, but rather meant  
to give some impressions of “a kid  
from the Bronx" on the directions of  
the lesbian and gay movement in con-  
temporary America.  

Apuzzo commented that she has seen  
a number of trends - or waves - in the  
movement. The earliest she spoke of  
was the one represented by the Stone-  
wall riots on the east coast and the  
Hallowe'en Ball on the west coast. It  
represents the moment in history when  
there was a reaching for dignity, an  
experience of anger, a time when les-  
bians and gays said "we've had enough!"  
- not only of bar raids, but of elec-  
troshock, lie detector tests, dis-  
honorable discharges from the military  
and other means of oppression.  

But a movement cannot function long-  
term on anger alone. This occurred for  
many lesbians and gays in what Apuzzo  
referred to as the “Anita Bryant” per-  
iod. "Some were moved beyond anger at  
this point by an unabashed prejudice  
which (through Bryant) reached an un-  
precedented commercial success...  

(many said) you may win a victory in  
Dade County, but not cheaply - it has  

CATALYST LIBRARY  

Catalyst’s unique collection of  
information on women and employment,  
recognized as one of the most cur-  
rent and comprehensive, has entered  
the new technology marketplace.  
The Catalyst library has produced  
the first specialized bibliographic  
database on women and employment.  

This bibliographic database,  
called Catalyst Resources for Women  
(CRFW), is accessed through Biblio-  
graphic Retrieval Services (BRS).  

It makes available Catalyst's li-  
brary resources to any location with  
an on-line terminal and access to  
BRS databases—corporate, university  
and public libraries; newspapers;  
and radio and television stations.  

The CRFW Database currently con-  
tains over 3,000 published documents  
on such two-career family issues as  
child care, alternative work pat-  
terns, parenting and relocation.  
Journal articles, studies, books,  
reports, bibliographies, audiovisual  
resources, magazines and newspaper  
articles are cited with publisher  
and source information plus a  
descriptive abstract. Materials on  
other employment issues including  
affirmative action, black and minor-  
ity women, job sharing, part time  
and flexible hours are also acces-  
sible.  

Continuous updates will expand  
the contents of the CRFW Database  
and cover such subjects as women  
entrepreneurs, financial aid for  
education, women in management and  
other areas of concern. Royalty  
fees for CRFW are $15 an hour, 25¢  
for offline citations and 15¢ for  
online citations. A thesaurus of  
terms used in CRFW will be revised  
bimonthly and is available through  
either Catalyst or BRS.  

For people without access to a  
computer terminal, Catalyst will  
conduct a search of the CRFW Data-  
base or any of approximately 70 BRS  
visit the library for a pre-search  
interview; a search cannot be re-  
quested over the phone. The Cata-  
lyst Library and Audiovisual Center  
is located at Catalyst Headquarters,  
14 East 60th Street, New York City.  
The library is open to the public  
Monday from 9 to 7:30 and Tuesday  
through Friday from 9 to 5. For  
more information about CRFW, please  
contact Gurley Turner, Director of  
Information Services, or database  
specialist Susan Barribeau at the  
Catalyst Library, 212-759-9700.  

invested us with determination...we  
learned what happens to some of us  
affects all of us, and we must work  
together."  

The current ‘wave' she sees is an  
unprecedented reaching out, a building  
of coalitions between oppressed groups,  
which further intensifies the effects  
of our working together. Not just  
“make it OK for me to be gay" but a  
commitment to stand together and say  
“all oppression stops here!"  

Several interesting points were  
brought out in a lively question and  
answer period that followed her talk.  
In expanding her point of the political  
clout that could be gained by coalition  
building, Apuzzo mentioned that the  
National Gay Task Force was organizing  
a voter registration drive for next  
year - no names needed, but "if we can  
tell those in power we have over two  
million registered lesbians and gay  
voters, they just may sit up and lis-  
ten!" Apuzzo urged all present to  
"get into the biggest closet there is  
- the voting booth!”  

In the same vein, a question was  
asked concerning separatism (male/  
female) in the movement nationally.  
Did this seem to be a current issue,  
or is there more of a movement to-  
ward unity? Apuzzo felt there was  
more of a trend toward working to-  
gether, which particularly started  
around the issue of AIDS, "New York  
City had a particularly apathetic

MARILYN BELL,  
EMMA BOOKSTORE  
(a member of the EMMA Collective)  

All businesses are having economic  
problems, and EMMA is not alone in  
this. Women-owned businesses are  
often small, and many are very new,  
just in the process of getting estab-  
lished. With the economy being tight  
women are looking for a good price  
on whatever they buy. A small, new  
business may not be able to offer  
as competitive a price as a larger  
chain. The conservative trend in  
these times may also affect women's  
concern for the support of women  
owned businesses.  

At EMMA we have seen a number of  
recent failures of women's bookstores,  
publishers and small literary maga-  
zines...one of the most notable is  
Persephone Press. Being smaller  
organizations, they might not be  
price competitive, but the loss this  
brings to women's culture is tragic.  

MARION JANOFSKY  

Marion Janofsky, an extremely dyna-  
mic woman, was married for a number of  
years when she felt a sudden need for  
“something to fall back on" if she  
ever needed it. With time, research,  
effort and determination, she has dis-  
covered several “somethings”. She is  
a stock investor, manages her own busi-  
ness as a Mary Kay Beauty consultant,  
and is in partnership with her daughter  
Rose in RJM Designs, a company that  
makes fabric covers for optical in-  
struments.  

When Marion returned to the work  
force, she expected to be welcomed with  
open arms. Instead, she was met with  
subtle discriminations, particularly  
those of age and sex. Fortunately,  
her previous experience in the work  
force gave her some idea of what she  
was up against.  

Four years ago, Marion set a goal  
to make a million dollars before 1985.  
From there, she “planned a route and  
it doesn't matter how many steps are  
taken along the way." Although she  

the time limit, she has operated on  
the basis that as long as she perse-  
vered, she would be closer to it. And  
her ever-increasing success certainly  
proves her point.  

What did Marion's family think of  
all this? Their initial attitude could  
be described as supportive with some  
reservations. For example, her hus-  
band was not too excited about her  
going into sales - perhaps, thinks  
Marion, because of the negative public  
image of salespeople. Her success has  
brought increasing support, as evi-  
denced by the fact that she is now in  
partnership with one of her daughters.  

Through reading, research and life  
experience, Marion is aware that women’s  

community for a long time," she said,  
“but AIDS is a disease which has now  
killed over 600. Everyone in NYC  
(in the gay community) knows someone  
who has died." She also cautioned  
“Let's not wait for a health care  
crisis to organize around. Women are  
realizing they, too, need to take note  
of this 'gay plague'. The government  
is presuming, once again, because a  
group is disenfranchised, they can ig-  
nore their need...women, in their  
apathy, are setting themselves up to  
be further victimized...look what the  
establishment health care system has  
done to women already."  

"We (gay and lesbian and other  
factions of the movement) may disagree,  
as do brothers and sisters in families,  
but we still have common causes. Let's  
tell everyone - we are here - to the  
mayors, Police, courts - you must deal  
with us. (Many in our coalition) have  
an imperfect relationship, but society  
is more imperfect. Networking is im-  
portant.”  

"Gay and Lesbian Pride," said Apuz-  
zo, returning to the theme of the month  
at the end of her talk, "leads to gay  
and lesbian power - but this should  
not equal gay and lesbian smug. What  
is power for? To address the funda-  
mentals of oppression in a concrete,  
committed way...I believe we have what  
it takes to meet that challenge."  

Over 150 people in the audience  
gave a long standing ovation in  
agreement. ©

opportunities are limited, albeit much  
improved from those of her generation.  
Vocational training when she was a girl  
guided young women to traditional jobs  
such as teacher or nurse. She feels  
very positive about her daughter “having  
the confidence to take that first  
step en route."  

It took Marion many more years to  
take that first step, which was in-  
vesting in stock. From there, she be-  
gan to research all types of work -  
from day care, to postal box services  
to, finally, Mary Kay Beauty Care Pro-  
ducts. She "wasn't afraid to start  
small and build from there” and this  
is exactly what she did.  

Marion saw many advantages in work-  
ing for herself through Mary Kay. She  
was able to choose her own hours, work  
at home, and spend time with her chi-  
ldren as well. Often working at home  
can isolate a woman, but this company  
allows for social contact through meet-  
ings, by telephone and at promotion  
parties. With a taste of freedom such  
as this, Marion declares she'll never  
work for anyone again.  

Marion Janofsky feels that if you  
want something badly enough, it is  
attainable. If you are motivated and  
work hard, success can evolve. Laugh-  
ingly, she says that “women have al-  
ways been on the bottom, so why should  
we be afraid to begin there in a busi-  
ness endeavor?" As a previous member  
of the Common Ground Collective, she  
points to the newsjournal as an ex-  
ample of taking an idea and bringing  
it to reality.  

For Marion, women in business is a  
vital issue. It was evident from her  
enthusiasm during our interview that  
she has accomplished much more than  
just something to ‘fall back on’; she  
has found an awareness of herself and  
of her unlimited capabilities.

PREGNANCY DISCRIMINATION  

With a 7-2 decision, the Supreme  
Court ruled that spouses of male  
workers must be provided the same  
pregnancy benefits as female co-  
workers. This ruling makes it man-  
datory for employers to offer equal  
pregnancy-related benefits to fe-  
male employees and male employees'  
wives, or none at all, and em-  
phasizes that pregnancy disability  
must be treated like any other  
medical condition.  

Writing for the majority,  
Justice Paul Stevens said that the  
Newport News Shipbuilding and Dry  
Dock Co. of Virginia, was guilty of  
sex discrimination against a  
married male worker, when it refused  
to provide full benefits for his  
wife's pregnancy. The sex-bias  
case revolved around the issue of  
whether or not pregnancy discrim-  
ination automatically becomes sex-  
discrimination. The Pregnancy  
Discrimination Act of 1978 pro-  
hibits discrimination against women  
because of pregnancy, childbirth  
and/or related medical conditions.  
The Supreme Court agreed that  
pregnancy discrimination indeed  
becomes sex-discrimination, and  
couples the Pregnancy Discrimination  
Act with the 1964 Civil Rights Act,  
part of which prohibits sex  
discrimination.  

Of interest to feminists, this  
case makes it easier for wives who  
work in the home, or wives who are  
on their husband's health insurance  
rather than their own, to get  
comprehensive pregnancy and  
childbirth benefits.
