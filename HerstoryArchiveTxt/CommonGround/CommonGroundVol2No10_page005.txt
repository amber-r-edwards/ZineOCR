The counterindication for women  
of westernized health care delivery  
systems may also, but need not  
necessarily extend to herbs. To  
give one historical example, in 1884  
Rev. Hilderic Friend wrote in  
Flower Lore that:

[Gerard says] "the root  

of Solomon's Seal, stamped  
while it is fresh and green,  
and applied, taketh away in  
one night, or two at most,  
any bruise, black and blue  
spots, gotten by falls,  

or women's willfulness,  

in stumbling upon their  
hasty husbands' fists." We  
have a faint recollection  
now of having seen women  
with "bruises" and “black  
and blue spots" about the  
eyes, but they must have  
been got by "falls," for  

-. surely husbands could not-  

prove “false" notwithstanding  
their wives are sometimes wilful (p. 363)  
Surely husbands may prove false.  
Denying it and obliterating the  
results with a poultice of seemingly  
familiar ingredients will not  
end the problem. Neither will  
blaming the victim for the battering,  
nor will a cure for bruises  
that is quick.  

Implicit in the quotation of  
Rev. Friend (whose friend, we might  
ask) and Gerard are several problems  
with westernized health care deliv-  
ery systems: the relatively few  
women among pharmacists, not to  
mention M.D.'s and dentists; guilt  
by association of so-called alter-  
native health care measures, many  
originally forthcoming from women;  
degrading images of women in  
medical textbooks; the patronizing  
attitude of many health care pro-  
fessionals toward women patients;  
the frustration forced upon women,  
e.g., by psychiatrists; the rate of  
sexual exploitation of women pa-  
tients as well as nurses and other  
health care personnel by men in the  
profession; gross over-prescription  
of psychotropic (acting on the mind)  
drugs to women--to name but a few.  

For a more recent example of  
misuse of herbal health care, see  
Jeanne Rose's Herbs and Things,  
published in 1981: "Anne de Landos  
...lived an exciting and scandalous  
life as a French courtesan, epicurean  
and confidante to...literate men...  
She...retired from love (though she  
almost committed incest with her

grandson at the age of seventy)...  
She was a celebrated beauty. Her  
body retained its youthful curves,  
her skin remained moist and smooth  
for all of her eighty-five years...  
The [beauty secret] she felt to  

be most important was her daily  
herbal bath..." (pp. 159-60). The  
recipe follows. :  

Health care self-sufficiency,  
the recipe is not. Nor does the  
quotation provide adequate histor-  
ical reference. The allegation of  
“almost committed" incest is  
glossed over; we are left with the  
impression that incest between  
grandmother and grandson is nothing  
extraordinary. Emphasis is placed  
instead, on a youthful and sexy  
appearance. Implicit in this quota-  
tion, too, are health care delivery  
system problems, for example, igno-  
rance and trivialization of the  
effects of aging upon women, and  
emphasis on cosmetic remedies, that  
women may conform to a fashionable  
image. In this instance, both  
author and subject are women. They  
seem possessed by 'false conscious-  
ness' or the ‘enemy within' namely,  
a patriarchal viewpoint. What's  
going on?  

If we are to reject its thrust,  
facing up to the politics of  
western medicine is important.  
Western medicine exploits women is  

That  

not new news. That herbals may  
figure in that exploitation is not  
often noted. After all, with the  
development in the western world  
of professional medicine, a reaction  
to herbal health care set in. The  
reaction was aggressive, and de-  
pended partly on persecuting herbal  
healers to make its point (see  
“Daphne's Tree," July 1983). In  
that context, herbal health care  
measures became radical action.  

The radical transformation, however,  
seems to this author incomplete.  
Radical means getting to the root.  

Herbs may indeed function to pro-  
mote "health care self-sufficiency"  
(Billy Potts, Witches Heal, p. 1),  
work preventively, and figure legi-  
timately in homeopathic medicine.  

To decide whether herbs perform these  
functions, we need to use our inner  
eyes and ears (Mary Daly, Gyn/Ecology  
p. 3). Without such inner percep-  
tions, we may find ourselves trapped  
by culture-bound or outward percep-  

- tions tied to the passive-aggressive  
character of western medicine: e.g.  

FOR RELIEF OF MINOR STRESS, TAKE  
PILTABCAP. Here, stress must be a  
minor, not major problem. PILTABCAP  
can't relieve major stress anyway.  
The symptoms, not the causes of  
stress must be removed. The imme-  
diate ingestion of something is  
necessary to remove the symptoms.  
The message is aggressive--YOU TAKE  
PILTABCAP! The behavior prescribed  
is passive--PATIENTS SHOULD DEPEND  
ON PILTABCAP!  

Many medical doctors will defend  
their recommendation by insisting  
that patients demand PILTABCAP.  
Supposedly the patient (one who is  
acted upon) can't know better than  
to make such a demand. Because of  
alleged demands by patients (a con-  
traindication in terms), doctors  
may argue that they can't do any-  
thing but fork over PILTABCAP.  

Let's analyze that logic, (for a  
wider analysis of this type of logic,  
see Virginia Woolf's To the Light-  
house).  

PILTABCAP is a commercial pro-  
duct. The pharmaceutical industry  
advertises extensively in popular  
and professional settings. Checking  
out ads in medical journals reveals  
pictures of distraught women. To  
the extent the law (ostensibly)  
allows, pharmaceutical companies  
lobby doctors. They ply doctors  
with incentives to use their pro-  
ducts. Incentives might take the  
form of coupons for free bottles of  
an aspirin-substitute, expensive  
cosmetics for the doctor's wife  

(women in the profession are there-  

by ignored), or samples.  
Who demands PILTABCAP? Who builds the  
demand in others? Iatrogenic, or  
patient-induced disease---forthcoming  
from overreliance on PILTABCAP--is  

a misnomer. Moving into self-pro-  
tection and herbal self-sufficiency  
has much to recommend.  

Now, who  

Unfortunately, we may find some  
herbal products on today's market  
lacking in potential for self-pro-  
tection and self-sufficiency. This  
is the author's opinion. No dis-  
respect is intended to any who  
struggle with herbal health care in  
the face of modern health care de-  
livery systems. Some of what is  
done commercially in the name of  
herbal health care may need to be  
re-examined. Criticism/self-criti-  
cism lies at the core of self-pro-  
tection and self-sufficiency.  

During an herbal workshop in  
Buffalo at 1983 International Women's  
Day Celebration, a woman asked  
about an herbal tonic on the market  
which contained several ingredients,  
most obscure to many shoppers. The  
questioner was concerned that she  
had experienced a side-effect of the  
tonic. The manufacturer, seeking  
a wider-than-local market, had lost  
touch with the individual purchasing  
his product. He seemed to be in  
no position for direct accountability.  
Most of us are not prepared to judge  
the desirability of such a product.  
Short of non-consumption, we are  
left with virtually no means to  
protect ourselves. Further, after-  
the-fact means for protection
