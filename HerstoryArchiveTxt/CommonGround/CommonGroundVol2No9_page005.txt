Although by the time this column
is printed the news of the trial of
6 men convicted of the barroom pool
table rape in New Bedford, Massachusetts will no longer be fresh, I
feel the need to share some of my
thoughts on the case itself as well
as my reactions to its coverage in
the media. What little I know about
legal maneuverings I have learned
from TV and newspaper news, and I pay
only passing attention to most trials
and court proceedings. But because
this case involved not only a rape,
but an alleged gang rape that by-
standers did not interrupt, I, as a
woman, was immediately drawn to fol-
low it.

No matter what the circumstances
were, no matter what the bar's atmo-
sphere was like that night, no matter
what the ethnic background of the men
is, no matter what kind of person the
woman is, no matter what words were
said, this mat-
Any rape I read or hear

tered to me.
about both enrages me and also touch-

es a nerve in me. But this rape -
which involved so brutal an attack
and so defenseless a victim - also
touched a place deep in my heart.

Of course, I know that all trials
have defendants, and that their
attorneys can viciously grill and
even wear down a victim with their
questions. I also know that, in a
sexist society such as ours, a rape
victim's sexual history is often the
subject of the defense attorney's
questions.

So why was I shocked when I read
that the victim was asked how long
it had been since she last had sex
with her boyfriend? Why was I in--
credulous because she was asked
whether she had ever been raped be-
fore? Why was I in disbelief as I
read that she was grilled about details
of her sexual history? Why was I
so angry because defense attorneys
questioned her about her drinking
habits and her status as a welfare
recipient?

I suppose that one could dismiss
such probing questions as simply the
means by which those six lawyers
do the job of defending their clients,
and thus earn their livings. But I
am afraid it is not so simple. Such
questions both resurrect and validate
the myth that women want to be raped
or that they invite rape. They im-
ply that rape is simply a result of
men's uncontrollable need to have
sex (another myth) - completely on
their own terms. They also suggest
that certain women, with certain

PAGE 4 COMMON GROUND

sexual pasts, are more likely to be

raped, or even worse, deserve to be
raped.

Finally, and most importantly,
such questions leave the false im-
pression that rape is a crime of sex.
It is not; rape is a crime of violence.
It is a crime which allows men to
abusively exert power and force over
women, and it will exist in any so-
ciety that is sexist in nature (and
conversely, does not in societies
that are not.*)

Because our society still allows
men to treat women like their pro-
perty, paternalistic attitudes abound.
When men boast that they would seek
revenge on anyone who raped their
wife or daughter, are they altruistically
thinking only of the women as
victims, or are they instead feeling
wronged because of the damage to
their property? The mask of chivalry
has long hidden the reality of control
and subordination of women.

I was reminded of such attitudes
every time I heard lawyers and others
being interviewed on TV refer to the
victim as a "girl". Mind you, she is
an adult female (age 22), who has
borne two children. I wonder if these
same people would refer to a 22-year-
old male parent as a "boy"?

Another controversial issue sur-
rounding this case was the extensive
amount of media coverage it received.
Critics feared, (and so do I) that so
much publicity would only serve to
discourage future victims of rape from
reporting the crime. For me, the epit-
ome of media overkill and exploitation
was reached by Cable News Network (CNN)
which aired the two trials (2 men were
tried separately from the four) -live-
for two to three hours a day.

While some (including lawyers for
them, with varying restrictions) argue
that the public has a right to know, I
have no doubt that Ted Turner's CNN
decided to broadcast this trial be-
cause of its inevitable lurid and sex-
ually explicit testimony; in hopes
of boosting their ratings. Again, my
heart ached for the victim, who was
being watched on daytime TV, just like
so many soap opera stars.

Even though such exposure publi-
cized the victim's identity, many
newspapers chose not to print her name.
Thankfully, The Buffalo News was one
of these. We knew too much about her
already; it would have served no pur-
pose to expose her identity to an al-
ready gawking, and sometimes even
hostile, public.

The aftermath of the trial was a
protest march by over 3,000 Portuguese
residents of the area, who felt that
the case was blemished by anti-Port-
uguese feelings (all 6 defendants, as
well as the victim herself, were
Portuguese) and that the sentences
received by four of the defendants
were too harsh. These protests re-
ceived so much media attention that
they nearly overshadowed not only
the trial but also the actual crime.

After being inundated with reports
of these protests, all I could think
was, "Wait a minute! A gang rape has
been committed, and bystanders cheer-
ed it on instead of preventing or at
least reporting it. What about the
seriousness of the crime? What about
the victim? What about her life now?"

almost non-existent, and women are

families with young children."

She seemed to be already forgotten,
as did the crime that violated her
freedom, that infringed on her right
to refuse, and that walked all over
her dignity as a woman.

So I was relieved when finally,
on March 30, I heard Bill Moyers
deliver an editorial comment on the
CBS Evening News which addressed this
very point. He reminded viewers that
we had all been too quick to dismiss
the horror of the crime. In addition,
he discussed how "the violent abuse
of women has become a form of enter-
tainment," pointing to many popular
movies and pornography as examples.

Finally, he opined that in this trial,
the victim became the villain, rather
than just the injured. After so much
sensationalized coverage, I was grate-
ful to hear him put the trial and its
coverage into perspective, and I was
comforted to know that I was not alone
in such views.

I suppose that I should be happy
that four of the six were found guilty
and given substantial sentences. But
my sense of justice was greatly tem-
pered by the sight of the two acquitted
men leaving the court on March 22 to
be greeted by a welcoming, cheering
crowd on the street. Needless to say,
as I, horrified, searched my TV screen,
I found few female faces in that ecstatic,
back-slapping group of supporters.
And I could not help but wonder if
any of those cheering men had also
been in Big Dan's Tavern that infamous
night a year ago. And worse, I could-
n't help but wonder what message that
celebrating crowd conveyed to the
millions of men watching that 6:30
news program.

Common Ground would like to wel-
come another fledgling publication in
Western New York, entitled Mother's
Lifeline. Begun in March of this year,
it is aptly subtitled "A Newsletter
Dedicated To The Enjoyment of Parent-
hood". Its founder and editor, Michele
Miller, introduced her publication in
the first issue by saying, "Mother's
Lifeline is a monthly newsletter
written for parents by parents to fill
a need in the Buffalo Metropolitan
area for a current and comprehensive
source of information of interest to
families with young children."

She added that it also aims to support
parents of young children, to pro-
vide some means of communication among
them, and to enable such parents to
connect with one another.

Miller, a former teacher for the
Buffalo Public Schools and the mother
of two small children, has been active
in the Parents' Division of ASPO/
Lamaze. As a result of these 3 kinds
of work, she came to feel that our
area needed a publication "devoted to
the educational, cultural and recre-
ational needs of young families."

She is financing the newsletter from
her own savings, and doing the bulk
of the work herself.

Mother's Lifeline includes such
things as a monthly calendar of activ-
ities and events for families with
young children, playgroup listings,
helpful hints, information about toys,
recommended children's books at the
public library; and shared parenting
experiences.
