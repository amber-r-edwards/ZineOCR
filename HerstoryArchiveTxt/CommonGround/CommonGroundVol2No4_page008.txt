Here Is A Love Song

Margie Adam

Pleiades Records, 1983

$8.50 Available at EMMA,

the Buffalo Women's Bookstore

Get out the candles, uncork a
bottle of something, preferably
French, and invite a friend over to
listen to Margie Adam's new release

from Pleiades Records, Here Is A Love

Song.

I liked it immediately. It's
slick, well produced, and a little
bit schmaltzy. In style, the songs
hover somewhere between jazz and pop,
from the melodic, singable title
tune, "Here Is A Love Song", to the
cabaret quality of "Time I Spent
With You". There's a good balance
between ballads and upbeat numbers.
Sell any number of these tunes to
Sheena Easton and watch them pop up
on AM radio.

The theme, or "concept", if you
will, is the two big "R's": ROMANCE
and RELATIONSHIPS. (Not current
relationships, however; the songs
are all about comings and goings.)
The nine songs, as promised, are
love songs, some hopeful and
happy, and others melancholy.
(There are some real good slow
dance songs here, by the way.)

I especially liked "Consequen-
ces", an inexplicably sad song
about letting go of someone you
love. It combines a haunting
minor-key melody with moaning
saxophone solos by Jean Fineberg,
whose work adds so much to the
entire album.

Switching gears to something
more upbeat, "Cool Around You"
is a jazzy number that describes
one of the most universal of
human emotions -- having a crush.
Who hasn't experienced spilling
their drink or suddenly noticing
their sweater is on inside-out in
front of someone they really
wanted to impress?

"I would do anything if I

could be cool around you//
Sign over everything if I

could be cool around you//
Hopelessly awkward, that's

my name//Can't think of

anything groovy to say,//

Oh I would do anything if
I could be cool around you".

...Well, that says it all.

My main criticism of this album
is its overall vague tone. The
songs could have been written for
anyone. Adam's voice is stronger
and surer on this release, but she
seems to have lost some of the
immediacy and emotional intensity
of her earlier efforts. With re-
peated listenings, certain melodic
similarities become apparent. One
becomes aware of the repetitiveness
of some of the lyrics.

She has assembled a fine core

THE ARTS

Deepected

Teresa Trull & Barbara Higbie
Olivia Records, 1983

$8.50, may be ordered thru EMMA

This is a wonderful album. It's
hard to think of what else to say be-
yond encouraging you just to go get
a listen of Unexpected, but I will
do my best.

The album is split in half, say
Teresa Trull and Barbara Higbie.

One side is for scrubbing kitchens

and the other side for slow sweetnesses. The slow side opens with the
only ballad of the record, "Ruby and
the Dancer". Trull sails through it
with a voice that sounds like her soul
is open. It is followed by an instrumental by Higbie using piano, Irish
harp and synthesizers.

The synthesizers are used again to
great advantage on the scrubbing-the-
kitchen side. The punctuated sound
of "A Change" was a joint product of
the two artists. The white-funk, Doobie-inspired title cut "Unexpected",
had me checking to see if this was
really a women-produced album. I had
gotten so used to hearing newcomers'
first records that I was delighted
and surprised to hear the sophistication
of "Unexpected".

The production is clean, the ar-
rangements uncluttered and expressive,
and the level of musicianship is the
best. My only complaint is that the
record didn't last longer.

Honestly - you can't go wrong.

They are both dynamic, energetic
musicians and this is a very fine
body of work. So I expect to see
you all in line to purchase this al-
bum. The line forms behind me.

of musicians to accompany her. The
horn arrangements are understated
and well played. Jazz lovers
would probably enjoy this album,
while I can be fairly sure that
folk traditionalists would not.

Put it on your Holiday list
for someone special.

A Thousand Cranes

Nan Hoffman

fret 'n fiddle 1983

$7.95

Available at EMMA and the
Western New York Peace Center

"A Thousand Cranes is an album
of songs for peace and for a better
environment...."

excerpt from album cover

Nan Hoffman has a very nice, yet
simple voice. It's very reminiscent
of a younger Baez, although much
less aggressive. Her selection of
songs is very appealing if you go
in for traditional folk music.

Side one is enjoyable. It offers
some good late night "light some
candles, let's listen to some music
and be mellow" music. Her rendition
of the Peace Round is very impressive. Side two, however, doesn't
come off quite as well. The second
cut, “Nuke Power", offers some horrendous harmony. On the song, "Down
the Road", the banjo gets a bit
overpowering. In general, the mix

doesn't seem to be of the best qual-

ity, even considering the "home-
grown" nature of the recording.

As trivial as it may or may not
be, I very much like the album
jacket. The cover art of a thousand
paper cranes (origami) is very
pretty. The back cover gives some
very interesting background on the
selected songs:

" 'I Dreamed I Saw A Thousand
Cranes' is based on the story of
Sadako Sasaki who survived the
bombing of Hiroshima at the age of
two. Ten years later, she contracted
leukemia as a result of exposure
to radiation. She remembered a
Japanese legend that cranes live a
thousand years, and if a sick per-
son folds a thousand cranes, his
wish will be granted and health
restored. She began folding cranes
and had completed hundreds when she
died. The children of Hiroshima
finished the cranes and dedicated a
monument to her in Peace Park on
which is inscribed their wish for
peace."

It is very encouraging that a
local woman artist has been able to
produce and market an album. I
wish her much success in the future.
I hope her next album offers a
broader range of musical styles
which will better highlight her
vocal capabilities.
