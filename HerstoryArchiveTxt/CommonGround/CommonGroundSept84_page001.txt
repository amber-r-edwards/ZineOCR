COMMON GROUND

Dear Reader,

If you are an old friend, keep their spirits high.

If you need to renew, check the announcements.

We are a group of women aged between the tip of twenty-five and sixty-three, ranging in age.

We are students, artisans; some select classic pink and blue, others traditional life artists, and not-so-traditional lifers. 

Some have cats, some have dogs, others live in Buffalo, some anywhere between Newfane and Niagara.

This paper is for us, it's for you, too.

September 1984

by, for and about women.

and untiring support of this newsjournal every month.

We are the only local women's publication with other women from all agencies and organizations that serve your needs. 

Join us in the celebration of our second anniversary. If you have received this issue on a complimentary basis, please subscribe. 

Now is the time. Groups and organizations submit articles, calendar notes and energy: we need you. Every little bit helps.

It's our birthday - after two years, "N.O.W. Women-Helping-Women," laughter and fun, we've made it - so help us keep making it as your women's newsjournal.

With love,

The Common Ground Collective
