THEATRE  
NOTES  

by S.M. Beck  

Although Erie County's Cultural  
Advisory Board recommended allocating  
approximately the same amount of  
money to local groups as last year,  
the county budget plan presents  
unprecedented cuts of 55% for some  
of our area's most beloved institu-  
tions, including the zoo, historical  
society, art gallery, Philharmonic  
orchestra and our local theatres.  
The 42 different groups affected by  
the cuts bring a wealth of cultural  
diversity to our area which would  
be severely diminished by the loss  
of funding—and some of the smaller  
groups may be lost entirely.  

Please urge your district legislator  
to reject the proposed budget cuts  
and support the recommendations of  
the Cultural Advisory Board.  

The Theatre of Youth (TOY) has  
planned another spectacular family  
entertainment offering for the  
holiday season. ‘The Tingalary Bird’  
by British playwright Mary Melwood  
was the first children’s drama to  
win the British Arts Council Award.  
It's a story about a Mean Old Woman  
and a Poor Old Man who learn that  
they still love and need each other.  
Artistic Director Meg Pantera has  
likened the Mean Old Woman to a  

female Scrooge, and pointed out  
that the play which TOY had pre-  
viously produced in 1978 is a fun  
show to do for the Christmas season.  
"It is full of stage magic and  
theatricality, humor and suspense  

make beautiful music and a strange  
bird appears and disappears during  
the course of one fantastical night.”  
According to Director David Jay,  

“The Tingalary Bird is spectacular...  
Kids will be awestruck." 'The Ting-  
alary Bird' will be onstage at the  
Pfeifer Theatre, 601 Main Street,  
from December 1st through 18th.  

For information call 856-4410.  

Ujima Company's production of  
Peter DeAnda's ‘Ladies in Waiting'  
under the direction of Lorna C. Hill

Kavinoky Theatre's highly  
acclaimed ‘Duet for One' will be  
onstage at the University of  
Rochester's Todd Theatre for two  
weeks beginning November 25th. The  
play by Tom Kempinski was inspired  
by British cellist Jacqueline  
DuPre, who was afflicted with  
multiple sclerosis while in her  
mid-20's. Under the direction of  
Anne Gayley and starring Eileen  
Dugan and Chris O

Here it is, another essay on mothers and daughters. Just what the  
world needs, another “How I Wish I Understood My Mother", or "My Mother  
My Friend", or better still, “My Mother's Mirror Image—Me." I am a  
daughter, and I am also a mother, which is probably my own daughter's  

curse.  

What is it then about a mother-daughter relationship that compels  
women to write? Is it that God damn pedestal we are placed on at  
birth, first as a daughter, and then later as a mother?  

A mother's hopes and dreams of a life, her life unfulfilled, are  
transferred at birth onto her tiny daughter's shoulders. All the  
things she missed, didn't become, her lack of accomplishments are  
given a second chance. Her daughter becomes her savior, the second  
coming, her redeemer, a prayer answered.  

A daughter looks to her mother as a life lived. Someone who has  
experience, perhaps traveled some hard roads. A person maybe who had  
limited choices, made them, and went on with life such as it was.  

The "I did it all for you" syndrome.  

The supreme sacrifice with everything on it, not unlike a pizza with all the works.  
And then it happened. The fall from grace:  
"You're just like me," my mother said one day as we sat opposite  

each other at a table in McDonald's.  

"You are living my life over.”  

She made this declaration not with pride, but with sadness, and  

revelation. I knew she was right.  

Today I am determined this path my mother followed, the one I  

inherited, has come to an end.  

I will not pass "our lives" onto my  

daughter. I will not hope and dream for her. Instead, I will push,  
I will encourage, I will challenge her to do better. To become.  
I will not sit across from her in a restaurant twenty years from  

now and see me.

Grace, Grace, and Bridget  

A True Story  
by Ilona Middleton  

Hospital stays make comrades of  
us all. Out of anxiety, we tend to  
share bits and pieces of our  
identities as if to say, “Remember  
me."  

The second to the last roommate  
to occupy the bed next to mine was  
a woman named Grace. She walked  
into the room supported by two  
canes. I calculated her weight at  
about ninety pounds and, on a five  
foot, seven inch frame, she looked  
a shadow, stooped and old - she was  
only sixty-seven.  

But Grace was quite alive and  
she let you know it. Her lined  
face was well made up and she  
insisted that the allotted hospital  
gown be replaced with one of two  
sets of silk pajamas.  

As lonely people do, she talked;  
gentle, sometimes interesting talk  
that rambled and repeated itself.  
If I listened carefully, I heard a  
story.  

Grace had two friends, Grace and  
Bridget. All three ladies lived in  
the same retirement complex and  
these women had, one way or  
another, found each other.  

Sick-Grace was lonely, as I  
said, but she didn't belabor the  
point. She had a bravado that  
carried her along, a rather  
romantic yet tough exterior like  
one of those 1940's movie heroines.  
She was an Irish, Catholic,  
never-married, retired telephone  
operator whose father had wielded a  
benevolent, patriarchal power over  
the women in his family, including  
Grace. Consequently, her fondest  
memories were of putting one over  
on the old gentleman.  

Well-Grace was a bawdy lady who  
liked to tipple a bit with both  
drink and men. She'd been knocked  
around, had two husbands, worked  
most of her life in bars, and  
generally saw life in a no-nonsense  
context, pragmatic, not negative.  
She had enjoyed herself too much to  
let the bad times spoil the fun.  
This woman mothered the other two.  

But Bridget had a child's face and  
was childlike, not childish,  
childlike. She was shy and gentle.  
It was as if life had wrapped her  
in a quilt and held her close, too  
close, allowing only a peek at  
reality now and then.  

Bridget had been raised in a  
convent. Her mother collected  
husbands, five actually. Bridget  
never knew them. Her mother felt  
the convent was the best place for  
Bridget.  

The evening before sick-Grace's  
operation, the three women got to  
talking about hospitals in general  
and doctors specifically.  
Sick-Grace said, "You know, there's  
no modesty here. These doctors  
just walk in, lift your nighty, and  
poke around." Well-Grace laughed  
and replied, “Honey, any of those  
doctors walk into my room, I lift  
my nighty and say, ‘Love, take what  
you want!'" Bridget was indignant  
and stated that "Any doctor comes  
into my room and wants to lift my  
nighty, I say no, no, and point to  
where it hurts. No one's lifting  
MY nighty." And, with what  
amounted to hauteur but looked more  
like embarrassment, Bridget made a  
quick, red-faced getaway through  
the door.  

Both Graces rolled over  
laughing, then well-Grace said to  
me, “Do you believe it? Bridget  
was married! Not only that, she's  
the only one at the retirement home  
with a boyfriend." "And,"  
interrupted sick-Grace, "all they  
do is sit on the couch, hold hands,  
giggle, and touch each other."  

“And," interrupted well-Grace,  
"that's probably all she ever did  
in her marriage!" Again, both  
ladies rolled over in laughter. I  
later learned that all was not  
heaven with the handholding couple.  
The gentleman friend liked to  
control things, especially Bridget.  

That evening both sick-Grace and  
I were edgy. I had some tests  

coming up the next day, and already  

black and blue from blood work,  
intravenous medication, etc., was  
rightfully worried about where they  
would find a likely spot for more  
testing.  

Grace, on the other hand, was  
going to have what was termed a  
belly button operation to repair a  
small rupture. Grace had  
congenital heart problems,  
therefore only local anesthetics  
would be used. This did not make  
her happy.  

We kept the television on for  
background comfort and to peek  
into, now and again, to observe  
other people's lives when ours  
started to pinch. Grace kept up a  
conversation over the television.  
I didn't mind. I wanted the  
distraction. Grace talked about  
her childhood, her old job, her  
parents, and her nephew who was to  
inherit whatever she had left to  
leave someone. At ten o'clock, the  
nurse gave her a sleeping pill. It  
worked, somewhat. She still talked  
but more to herself now and to  
people I didn't know. After a  
quiet moment, she woke. "I've had  
such a nightmare," she said  
fretfully. "It frightened me. I  
want it to go away!" She fell  
asleep. All was still except for  
the man down the hall who cried  
most nights.  

Grace woke again, smiling. "I  
had a nice dream, so very nice. I  
dreamt that you invited me to your  
home for lunch and we had tea and  
sandwiches and we talked and you  
asked me to come again. I liked it  
very much."  

"Well, we can do that, Grace," I  
said, “when you're better."  
Hospital comrades have good  
intentions. She fell back to sleep  
again and I heard soft ramblings,  
then nothing.  

Grace went to her operation  
talking. She went through her  
operation talking, instructing the  
doctors on what was and was not  
allowed. She went to intensive  
care and back to our room talking.  
I could hear the exasperation in  
the voices of the nurse and orderly  

curtain. I didn’t want to talk to  
Grace. She understood and remained  
quiet until I regained my  
equilibrium.  

I was amazed at Grace. Her  
spirits were good. She seemed  
jovial and lively after her  
operation, that is, as long as the  
pain medication lasted. I found  
myself frequently saying, "Grace,  
for God's sake, lie down!" Useless  
advice - until the medication wore  
off. That set her back a bit.  

The next day the orderly came in  
to get Grace up and walking. She  
was to go home soon and had to be  
ambulatory. The aide got Grace to  
the chair and, as she sat down,  
Grace exclaimed, “Oh, I don't feel  
too well," and died.  

There I stood, in my nighty,  
attached to an I.V. pole, feeling  
very much like a kid in the way. I  
was ushered out into the hall. My  
bed soon followed me and all  
extraneous furnishings. The code  
ten team came racing along the  
corridor. Our room filled with  
machines and people. I, on the  
other hand, was being soothed down  
the hall to the visitors' lounge  
where I would spend the next two  
hours, in my nighty, with I.V.  
appendage, in a room full of  
strangers.  

I started to sniffle thinking of  
poor Grace and then I sniffled  
thinking of poor me. Until that  
very day I'd felt immortal, as if I  
decided when and where and if I  
would die. Grace had died. She  
wasn't sleeping.  

The nurse finally came in to get  
me. I looked up at her and asked,  
“How's Grace?" Stupid question.  
She smiled and said, "We revived  
her after two minutes and she came  
back talking. Her first words  
were, 'I just wanted to see if you  
guys were on your toes!'"  

They moved Grace to the cardiac  
care unit where I understand she is  
driving the staff mad with  
conversation.
