STATEMENT OF SELECTIONS COMMITTEE

The Selections Committee for this
“Arts" issue was comprised of Common
Ground collective members and women
from Western New York's arts commun-
ity. Material for this special issue
had been solicited for months, and
we received a tremendous number of
poems, photos and other kinds of
submissions.

In four selections meetings where
we sorted through all of this mater-
ial, we found that we all had our own
investments and criteria. The choices
of poetry were the most difficult to
make consensus decisions about. Some
of us read for style, clarity, and
craft, while others looked for
emotional impact and effect. We had
a tough time dealing with our own
space limitations (this issue is 28
pages!), when some women submitted
several poems that got hurrahs from
all quarters and we had to decide
which one or ones to publish.

The one thing we looked for was
reflections of women's lives and
experiences. That is the common
ground found in all this work.

NEWS FROM THE COLLECTIVE...

IT'S A SELLOUT!! The response for
this issue was overwhelming - so much
so that we increased the size of the
paper by 8 pages and were still unable
to print all works selected - they
will appear in future issues.

The Collective is so impressed by
the quality of the poems submitted
that we are considering a regular
poetry feature page - more on this
in future issues.

GOOFS! Sorry, folks - we really
don't have "non-profit" status - yet.
We are a registered charitable corp-
oration only - but the I.R.S. has to
approve it before we are tax-deduct-
ible. So, please don't claim gifts
to Common Ground on your income tax
until it's all legit.

Our apologies Sarah and Karen,
for omitting your names from last
month's ‘women who worked on the
paper’ - your hard work is always
much appreciated.

POLICY

PHILOSOPHY — Common Ground is potentially, with
help from Western New York women, a forum to
celebrate the rich diversity of our community. We view
the paper as a ribbon that may connect our
commonalities, our intersection points. We are inviting
you to participate actively in the building of a support
system for WNY women. We affirm our commitment to
enhance the lives of women on physical, educational,
spiritual, psychological, social and economic levels. We
want to present, fair-mindedly, the issues that concern
women, and information of value to women. We offer
Common Ground as a place where women can display
their art and personal literature, and re-view the
tapestries of their experiences.

EDITORIAL POLICY — Common Ground is especially
looking for articles which address the needs and
interests of local women.

1. Common Ground is a publication of news, culture
and dialogue from women’s perspectives.

2. News, Opinion, Analysis and Commentary will each
be clearly labeled as such.

3. We are seeking to provide accurate, straightforward
information of value to women.

4. The collective will not intentionally print or support
materials or viewpoints which will harm women
because of color, sexuality, religious or ethnic
background, physical disability or economic situation.

5. While opinions expressed in Common Ground are
those of the authors and not necessarily those of the
collective as a whole, we do accept responsibility for
choosing what we print.

We welcome articles, letters,

and announcements of interest to women.
Graphics, cartoons, art and bibliography will be
gratefully received. We especially invite women who
do not usually have access to traditional media —
women of color, differently abled, economically or
educationally disadvantaged, and those for whom
English is a second language — to write. Suggested
length of letters: 250 words. Letters must be signed to
be printed. We will, however, respect your privacy and
withhold your name if you request. Suggested length of
articles, commentary, analysis: 500-750 words. Please
type and double-space your work, 40 characters across.
If you do not have access to a typewriter, please print
clearly. In time we hope to have a typewriter, paper,
etc., available for those who request it. Include a
stamped, self-addressed envelope and work and home
phone numbers. Because we want to hear your voices,
if your piece needs to be edited for length or clarity, we
will call you/ask you to do it. Keep copies of your work.
We will try to notify you within three (3) weeks if we
intend to use your work. If we print it, we will give you
five (5) copies of the issue in which it appears. Artwork
should be black and white copies only, and
title/describe your work. We will copyright the entire
issue, but the copyright on each piece reverts to the
author/artist, so that she may decide where her work is
printed. Please request a stylesheet for further
information and guidelines if you want to write.
