Vethese are the people who get lost

by Ruth Geller

When I first informed Anne Montes
that she had unanimously been chosen
by me to be the first Western New
York Woman of the Month, she laughed.
"You're crazy," she said.

"Maybe so," I answered, "but how
about it? What do you think?"

She hesitated. "I don't know,”
she said. "I don't like to blow my
own horn."

“Well you won't be blowing it,

I will. Come on, what do you say?"
~ at least, from the generosity

of her heart -- her generous heart
is one reason I chose her -- she
consented.

I went to visit Anne one afternoon
at EMMA, the Women's Bookstore, where
she staffs one day a week. We sat
at the back of the store, and I
turned on my tape recorder.

Some of you might know Anne from
her work with International Women's
Day, or Women's Action for Nuclear
Disarmament. She has been a nurse
for thirty years, working in and
for institutions, but recently has
gone into private practice. When
I asked her why she made this de-
cision, she said, "I wanted to do
things in a way I feel they should
be done. I wanted an opportunity

to be able to practice nursing the

way I felt it should be practiced.
I often make

ho

in the shuffle, even though they
might have families who are present
when they're in the hospital and
who talk to nurses and physicians.
A lot gets lost in the translation
because people don’t really sit
down and listen."

I nodded. "Talk a little bit
about your recent experience."

"Well, recently I was called
by the son of a woman who was eighty-
five years old. She'd been in the
hospital because she'd fallen and
gotten a blood clot that was pressing
on her brain and she had to have
that pressure relieved. She recovered
from her surgery; and was sent
home, but was completely unmanageable
by her son. She couldn't stay
in bed, she kept getting up, she was
very argumentative, and cursed a
lot... And the conclusion by
everyone was that she was now just:

a crazy old lady and would probably
need institutionalization."

"In other words," I said, "in-
stead of looking at why she was be-
having this way, all they wanted
to know was how they could get her to
stop."

"Right," Anne said, and continued, "She was extremely distracted
and very combative, very restless.
And this was completely different
from any behavior she'd ever exhibited before. The general consensus
was that because she'd had this fall,
this was why she behaved this way.
But when I went in, I saw that she
was on three different medicines to
help her calm down. And she was
absolutely agitated and wild, so
obviously these medicines were not
doing what they were intended to do.

GOOOOEOEEEEEEEEE

W.N.Y. Woman of the Month: Anne Montes

So the question then was:
was she still on them?"

"I talked to her son, and I said,
'I think you should stop some of
these medicines, but I'll talk to
your physician first.' The son
agreed, and the physician was agreeable.
He said, ‘Fine, go ahead
and stop the medicine, but I think
you're going to have problems anyway
because we've tried every kind
of medication while she was in the
hospital and nothing calmed her
down.'"

"So...First we stopped the sleeping
pill and tranquilizer she was on.
And she seemed to settle down a
little bit and was able to get some
rest. And then we stopped another
medication which was a stronger
type of tranquilizer which is oftentimes used with confused elderly
people. And the following day when

she woke up in the morning, she
said, ‘Where have I been?' and
was no longer swearing and fighting
and carrying on."

"Did she remember anything?" I
asked. “Was she totally unaware
of what had happened?"

"She didn't remember anything,"
Anne said. "The last thing she
remembered was agreeing to have

the type of thing that nurses do
all the time, and it's not recognized.
Nurses are the unseen agents
many times that make the difference
in the quality of life the person
has, and many times between life
and death. Because they're the
ones, if they can get the physician's ear, who will make him stop
and re-evaluate something. Or
they'll get him to say, 'Go ahead,
go ahead,' because he's busy; and
really doesn't want to take the
time to stop and worry about a
ninety-year-old person when he
knows he's got a thirty-year-old
person he can do something about.
It's a much more positive thing

for a physician to treat someone
who's thirty and get them all better
and make them go out and live, than
to be fiddling around with someone
who's ninety and doesn't have a
long life expectancy anyway..."

"I don't want this to sound
like what I did was something un-
usual," she went on. "Because
nurses do this all the time. And
they know they do it but nobody
else seems to know they do it.

And it happens day in and day

out. Many nurses don't get involved
because they don't get re-
warded, they don't get recognition
for this, and they tend to start
putting their eight hours in, and
doing what the doctor says, and
not questioning."

"And you have to be very care-
ful," she added. "The most acceptable
way of getting something changed that a physician has ordered is to approach it in a very cautious way as if you almost make
the physician think it was his
idea. Like you present him with
information he wasn't thinking
about before. So that he can say,
"Oh yeah, let's try this,' and
that's the way it works a lot."

"But by doing what I'm doing,
I'm not working with any one physi-
cian or any institution, and I have
to be very careful how I present
things to physicians because if I
said to this woman's son, 'Stop
this medicine,' even though I knew
that's what we should do, and something happened to that woman, I
would have my license on the line
because I don't have legal authority
to change any of the physician's
regimen."

I nodded. "I imagine that
nurses often have trouble getting
doctors to accept them as sensible
people, as equals who are concerned
about medical care."

"Yes. Many doctors realize that
nurses perform a very important
function, and it's all right as
long as they're performing this
function in such a way that it's
not threatening. But if you ques-
tion the physician in public..."
She smiled. "Or if you would tell

a physician he's wrong...I just
can't imagine telling a physician,
'You've

re wrong.

Even

qd. “Even if he is wrong."
And that's the way I've been social-
ized into the system, so I kind of
play a game, too. There's been a
lot written in nursing literature
about the games that are played."

"If you hadn't gotten that woman
off the medication," I asked, "what
would have happened to her?"

"In all likelihood, she would
have been institutionalized."

"Does she know what happened
with the medication? Does she
know your part in it?"

"Not really! In fact, the interesting thing was that when she was
feeling better and kind of starting
to take charge of her home situation
again, she was having a problem with
dizziness one evening, and her son
called me to come. And I came up
and checked her out, and she was
angry because the doctor didn't
come. And she said, 'You're just
a nurse.'" Anne laughed.

"How did that make you feel?"

I asked.

"Well, it didn't make me feel
bad because I recognized the con-
text, you know, where it's coming
from, and it's the way the public
views nurses: nurses don't do very
much. They do what the doctor tells
them to do. And this woman has
never had any contact with nurses
who have the skills to do physical
exams, assessments, and things like
that. So she knows I'm a nurse,
and she knows I'm all right with
her doctor. But I'm not the doctor.
So I ask her what the doctor did
for her when he was here. And she
said, 'Well he doesn't do anything
either!'"
