Diary Cont...

stage to perform before this audi-
ence of partially-clad women. (As
an aside, the music festival is
also famous for allowing women the
opportunity to move around without
benefit of clothing. It tends to be
an issue of great soul-searching
before and during the festival.
Should I or shouldn't I? Will

I have to because of the peer
pressure? My experience is that
it's acceptable to be fully clothed,
fully disrobed, or at any stage in
between. This year there was an
odd twist because of the dust.

Some women appeared only in shoes
and socks or only in bandannas
covering their faces!)

Henia has dedicated her perfor-
ming career to never letting the
world forget the horrors of the
Nazi era. She read excerpts from
the Diary of Anne Frank and spoke
of her own experience, bringing
her audience to tears. She
finished with a statement of thanks
for being with us and a reaction to
the festival. She said she had
been so impressed with the commu-
nity we had created in such a short
period of time, the support, the
caring we offered each other, the
work that was being done through-
out the festival site. "I am so
overwhelmed," she said, "that the
next time I might try women!" The
crowd stood, roared, cheered and
clapped until Henia and Dovida
came out to do an encore, an Israeli
folk song which was a celebration
of women gathering. Many women in
the audience knew the folk song and

11 p.m. Friday, Night Stage -
On our way back from the day stage,
Barb and I ran right into Jeannette
and Margaret who had made their way
to the shuttle drop-off point with
all of their gear and were exchang-
ing duties of staying with the gear
and going out in search of Meg, Barb
and me. Maybe it's not so uncommon
for these connections to be made,
but it feels miraculous. The crowds
are so vast, the tents all look the
same and the communication system
is so fragile.

And the music at the night stage
was wonderful, again. The Robin
Flower Band played first. Robin
Flower has been around the women's
music circuit for several years but
I had never heard her. She plays
fiddle with the best of them. Her
bluegrass music took me back to my
days in New Hampshire where country
music is so popular.

Holly Near played next and she is
one of my favorites. Her style as a
performer is so natural, so powerful
and so political that I feel re-
charged, self-affirmed and proud of
my lesbianism and feminism every
time I see her.

Cathy Rose Salit is a newcomer to

the Michigan Festival who presented
a mix of the ethnic and social
rhythms she heard when she was grow-
ing up on New York's West Side.
Such an array of musical styles are
being performed here! It would be
hard not to have your musical hori-
zons expanded, no matter what it is
you are used to hearing.

2 p.m. Saturday, at the Main Gate-
Barb, Meg and I are working a secur-
ity shift at the Main Gate. This is
how the work of the community gets
done during the four days of the
festival. Every participant is ask-
ed to work a four-hour shift doing

something - childcare, security,
attendant to differently-abled women,
health care worker, shuttle driver,
registration clerk, food preparer.
We are directing traffic at the
Main Gate with about six other
women. It is hot, dusty, boring
work. Even on Saturday afternoon
there is a line-up of 6 cars at the
gate waiting to come in for one or
two days of the festival. Others
are leaving to go to town for a
beer-and-junk-food run.

11 p.m. Saturday at the Night
Stage - We got back in time to rush
around trying to make connections
for dinner, eat and get to the night
stage for the concert. We missed
the day stage performances today.

I was sorry not to have seen Ther-
ese Edell and Betsy Lippett. Betsy
was so good when she played in
Buffalo earlier this year!

Thankfully the weather has im-
proved. There was a cloud cover
last night and tonight so it's been
much warmer than Thursday night was.
We haven't even had to wear jackets
until 9:30 or so.

Cris Williamson started the con-
cert tonight. I love her music, but
she has managed to annoy me both
times I have seen her play. Tonight
I went down to the front of the stage
to get a picture for Common Ground,
but she cut off the photographers
about 10 minutes into her perform-
ance. There was definitely the
flavor of the prima donna at play.

Sojourner also requested no
picture taking, but did so before
the set so it was a little less
annoying. What a group they are!
Harp, flute, bass, vocals, congas,
clarinet, sax and sitar. Their
music is really alive.

The last set was by Chevere, the
only all-female Latin and Brazilian
jazz ensemble in San Francisco's
Bay area. They, too, were first-
time performers at the festival and
their music was one of the horizon-
expanders for me. They do Afro-
Cuban jazz (also known as mambo and
cha-cha) and Brazilian jazz (Bossa
Nova and samba) and you cannot sit
still while they play. The music
makes it mandatory to get up and
move.

Noon, Sunday, August 15, On the
Road - The music goes on, but we
have to leave to get Barb back to
work tomorrow morning. This is an

COMMON GROUND

experience in sisterhood. Meg,
Barb, Bette, Margaret, Jeannette
and I spent the morning getting
packed up and out to the parking
area. Although the shuttles were
working, we were admonished to walk
if we could, so we sent the heavy
gear with Barb and Bette and Marga-
ret on the shuttle and the rest of
us walked with what we could carry.
Margaret and Jeannette went on as
their route was to be different from
the rest of us. Our caravan of
three cars was humble. Meg's car
was sick with what we had diagnosed
as possible valve trouble. It did
better if we drove 45 or 50 miles
per hour, so we moved slow. Bette
had come down with a terrible cold
the first day of the festival and
had been fairly trying to make her-
self comfortable ever since. Barb
is driving Bette's car home while

I drive hers. This is what sister-
hood and a "family of friends" is
all about. Someone to drive your
car home from Michigan when you're
sick. Someone to caravan with you
when your car is sick. It's so
nice for me to be doing the giving
rather than the receiving this time.
I've had more sick cars than well
cars in my life, so have logged
lots of time on the receiving end,
I'm glad to offer my well vehicle
and my well self for a change.

The re-entry to the real world
from the world of the music festi-
val is less dramatic this year
than it was last year. Perhaps
because I'm more occupied with the
particular problems of this cara-
van. That seems to be a comment on
the festival experience for me this
year. The effort it took to get
from place to place and do the

things that needed to be done kept
my mind occupied so I didn't have
the chance to be overwhelmed.

6 p.m. Saturday, August 28,
in Buffalo - I have just returned
from doing my first draft of this
article with a very unsettled feel-
ing. I only put my finger on it as
I talk it over with Barb. It's de-
layed shock syndrome to my re-entry
to the world at large. I have care-
fully written this using first names
only so as not to unduly publicize
the lesbian identity of my friends.
But for myself, I used my full by-
line. Somehow it just slipped by me
what a risk that was. I spent much
time this spring and summer in the
process of coming out to the co-
workers in my office. But I am not
out with the workers in other offic-
es or the administration. I imag-
ined one of them picking up a copy
of Common Ground. Then I hit a
void in my fantasy. It could have
any of a number of endings, most
of them not pleasant. It is so
enraging! This need to play a pro-
tection game goes on no matter
when, where and how many times you
come out. There is always one more
time to keep quiet, one more time
to learn how much it takes to strike
the balance between breaking the
seal of secrecy in which we live and
being economically and personally
safe. So, for this article, for
this point in my and our struggle,
there are too many unknowns. I
write with only half of my by-line.
And, once again, I make the vow that
it will only be a moment in the
process. Today it begins again.
Assess the risk of coming out to

the administration, assess the level

of support I can expect from others,
develop a strategy, carry it out.
Lesbian life goes on.@
