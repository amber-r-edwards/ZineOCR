‘Women = Cancer.

by Elizabeth Wilkes, R.N.

According to present cancer rates,  
one in every four persons will de-  
velop cancer. This means that you  
or someone close to you will fall  
victim to the disease. On average,  
more than 440,000 people die of can-  
cer in the United States each year.  
The American Cancer Society estimates  
however, that 139,000 lives, or 32%,  
could be saved by early diagnosis and  
prompt treatment.

Early diagnosis is the key to ef-  
fective treatment. Detecting cancer  
early is not as difficult as it might  
seem; nobody knows your body better  
than you. If a change occurs, this  
could be a warning sign and should  
be checked by your physician or health  
care provider. Only they can deter-  
mine if the change warrants further  
diagnostic tests. It is important  
for you to be able to identify the  
seven warning signs of cancer:

* Change in bowel or bladder habits  
* A sore that does not heal  
* Unusual bleeding or discharge  
* Thickening or lump in the breast  
or elsewhere  
* Indigestion or difficulty in  
swallowing  
* Obvious change in a wart or mole  
* Nagging cough or hoarseness  
If you have a warning sign, consult  
your physician immediately.

To guard against the most common  
cancers threatening American women,  
it is important to know about the  
highly effective and specific methods  
of early detection available today.  
Although cancer risk factors differ  
for each individual, lifestyle and  
health habits can significantly im-  
pact one's cancer risk.

Lung, breast, uterine, ovarian and  
colorectal cancers represent the most  
prevalent cancer deaths in women.  
Lung cancer has surpassed breast can-  
cer as the number one cancer killer  
of women. (Breast cancer ranked num-  
ber one for more than 50 years). Ap-  
proximately 49,000 new cases of lung  
cancer will be diagnosed in 1986,  
with 41,000 deaths. Nearly half of  
these deaths could be prevented if  
women did not smoke cigarettes.

When focusing upon health and  
fitness many women turn their at-  
tention to their weight. While  
this is certainly not the sole de-  
termination of how fit one is, it  
is an important factor because it  
is an outwardly apparent sign as  
well as a factor that society uses  
to determine how attractive one is.

Many women find it very difficult  
to control their weight. If approached  
logically, it appears such an easy  
thing to do; either eat less, exercise  
more, or do both and one will lose  
weight. Why then is weight control  
one of the most frustrating and de-  
moralizing experiences in life for  
some people?

Indeed, some women find themselves  
obsessed with thoughts of food but  
also with how they look. They weigh  
themselves constantly yet find them-  
selves eating constantly. New "diets"  
are started almost daily with new  
resolutions falling by the wayside  
as the day progresses. Some women  
have even fallen into the compulsion  
of binging on food and then purging  
themselves through vomiting and/or  
laxatives.

If you recognize yourself in some  
of the previous discussion, it may  
be helpful to examine your approach  
to controlling your weight. The  
first mistake overweight people usu-  
ally make is to try to lose weight  
by “dieting.” This is a fatal error  
and one that will set off a powerful  
emotional response for most previous-  
ly unsuccessful dieters.

Merely thinking of the word “diet”  
implies a set of strict rules whereby  
some foods are forbidden and others  

States, accounts for approximately  
75% of lung cancers among American  
women and about 10% of other cancers  
in women. Women who smoke two or  
more packs of cigarettes per day have  
lung cancer mortality rates 15 to 25  
times greater than non-smokers. The  
chest x-ray, as a routine screening  
procedure, does not detect lung can-  
cer early enough. Therefore, preven-  
tion is most important. Don't smoke!

You've come the  
wrong way, baby!

Breast cancer is ranked second in  
cancer deaths among women in this  
country. One out of 11 women will  
develop breast cancer in her lifetime.  
It is estimated that 123,000 new cases  
will be diagnosed in 1986 with 39,000  
deaths resulting. However, through  
early detection and prompt treatment,  
about 87% of breast cancer patients  
could be saved. Methods of early  
detection include:

* Monthly breast self-examination  
(from teen years on)  
* Mammography  

All women age 50 and over (annually)  
Women age 40-49 (every one to two  
years, depending on your physician's  
recommendations)  

Women 35-39 (a baseline mammogram)  
* Professional Breast Examination  
Women 20-40 (every three years)  
Women over 40 (every year)  

Potential risk factors include a  
personal or family history of breast  

Food is to be care-  

are encouraged.  
fully monitored and controlled and  

must be prepared certain ways. There  
is so much focus on food that it is  
no wonder that soon a person is ob-  
sessed by food and starts craving  
only foods on the “forbidden" list.  
Many diets suggest a magic formula  

or secret combination of foods that  

can lead to a very poor nutritional  
balance. Even relatively safe well-  
balanced diets entail so much calo-  
rie counting and special recipes  
that a person becomes overly involved  
with food. Most are so strict that  
it is nearly impossible for a person  
to adhere for an extended period of  
time. Even if a person manages to  
lose a desired amount of weight, the  
term “diet” implies that there is an  
end to the new eating pattern and  
once the weight goal has been reached,  
the person may return to former (i.e.,  
fattening) eating patterns.

Considering that over 80% of  
dieters either fail to lose their  
weight or gain the weight back after  
reaching their goal, it is obvious  
that dieting is not the answer to  
weight loss. What is needed is a  
combination of permanent lifestyle  
change coupled with a method of dis-  
covering and coping with the emotional  
reasons for a food dependency.

A permanent lifestyle change should  
involve two areas. The first is to  
begin to increase activity level.  
This might involve a structured exer-  
cise program or it could mean making  
a concerted effort to expend as much  
energy as possible each day (i.e., walking  
instead of driving, climbing  
stairs rather than an elevator, etc.).  
Most people gain weight as they age  
by becoming less active, not by eating  
more. The second area is to begin to  

cancer, never had children or first  

child after age 30.

Colon and rectal cancer occurs  
slightly more often in women than  
men, and most often in women over  
age 50. It is estimated that 73,000  
new cases will be diagnosed in 1986  
with 30,900 deaths. Through early  
detection, three out of four lives  
could be saved. The American Cancer  
Society recommends three effective  
early detection tests:

1) The digital rectal exam - after  
age 40 (yearly)  

2) The stool blood slide test -  
after age 50 (yearly)  

3) The procto-sigmoidoscopy (the  
procto) - after age 50 (every  
three to five years following  
two negative tests one year apart)  

Risk factors include:

* A family or personal history of  
colon and rectal cancer  

* A family or personal history of  
polyps in the colon or rectum  

* Ulcerative colitis  

Only a physician can assess an in-  
dividual's cancer risk and determine  
how frequently these tests should be  
performed.

Uterine cancer ranks fourth in  
incidence - an estimated 50,000 new  
cases in 1986; 14,000 cases of cancer  
of the cervix and 36,000 cases of  
cancer of the endometrium. The death  
rate for uterine cancer has declined  
more than 70% due to the widespread  
use of the pap test.

Every woman should have a pap test  
once every three years after two ini-  
tial negative tests one year apart,  
beginning at age 20 or when a woman  
becomes sexually active.

A pelvic examination should be  
performed every three years from age  
20 on, yearly after age 40. The pap  
test is highly effective in detecting  
early cervical cancer but is only ef-  
fective in detecting 50% of all cases  
of endometrial cancer. Women at high  
risk of developing endometrial cancer  
should have an endometrial tissue  
sample at menopause.

Risk factors for cervical cancer  
are:

* Early age at first intercourse  

* Multiple sex partners  

Risk factors for endometrial cancer  
are:

* A history of infertility  

* Failure to ovulate  
* Prolonged estrogen therapy and  
obesity.

Most skin cancer is curable. Light  
complexioned women are more likely to  
develop skin cancer. A serious type  
of skin cancer, melanoma, occurs in  
approximately 11,000 women each year  
with 2,300 deaths resulting.

If you notice a change in a mole  
or blemish, or any unusual change, see  
your physician immediately. When in  
the sun apply appropriate sunscreens  
and wear protective clothing.

Consult your physician about your  
cancer risk. A cancer-related check-  
up is recommended every three years  
from age 20-40, thereafter, yearly.

As more women understand, accept,  
and protect their bodies they will  
be able to participate more know-  
ledgeably in decisions about their  
health care. Knowledge and informa-  
tion are what all women need to bring  
their health choices and decisions  
into operation.

habits rather than imitating other  
overweight dieters' habits, they would  
soon begin to lose weight [albeit  
slowly] without giving up all their  
favorite foods or starving themselves.

They would also begin practicing  
lifetime habits which would prevent  
re-gaining the weight.

This lifestyle change is not an  
easy task without a second compo-  
nent of discovering and coping with  
the emotional basis for compulsive  
eating. Most overweight people need  
some professional guidance to help  
them with this. It is helpful to  
begin by realizing that overeating  
is not a will-power or hunger problem.  
Rarely is a person overweight because  
they are hungry or they like food.  
Usually food has become a coping  
mechanism that helps them deal with  
life's emotional ups and downs. It  
works easily and wonderfully: food  
is convenient and accessible, it is  
socially acceptable, and it feels  
good. However, it is an ineffective  
coping mechanism because it does not  
deal permanently with a person's  
anger, stress, boredom, loneliness,  
unspoken feelings, etc. One must  
begin to find more effective coping  
mechanisms to take the place of food.  
Otherwise it is impossible to expect  
oneself to give up food if it is not  
replaced by something else. This ap-  
proach will take support, time, effort,  
failure, self-understanding and self-  
forgiveness. But it is finally the  
only answer to permanent weight control.
