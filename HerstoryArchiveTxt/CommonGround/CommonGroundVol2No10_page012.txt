Conference Report: Dimensions of Racism

jobs, but, for Blacks, the facts  
about "where we've been and where  
we are going are contrary to these  
myths."

"Most people," she said, "got  
their jobs by not competing with  
someone else." Blacks and other  
minorities are prevented from getting  
qualified by a racist system, and  
then those that are qualified are  
still prevented from succeeding.

She defined the task at hand as

“fulfilling the promise of democ-  
racy. In a democracy, all decisions  
are up for political grabs, otherwise  
there is only totalitarianism." It  
is up to the people to realize they  
have rights and should not be afraid  
of demanding to exercise them.

She feels it is important to  
separate out the truth from what peo-  
ple would like us to believe is the  
truth.

Berry then talked specifically  
about the Reagan administration, and  
its emphasis on defense vs. social  
spending. She said that President  
Reagan uses a definition of the  
purpose of the federal government  
that is only partly true. She said  
Reagan's response to criticism of  
the size of the defense budget, is  
to say the federal government is to  
“provide for the common defense."  
But, nowhere does it say defense is  
the only thing the Constitution de-  
mands. Indeed, it is not given any  
more weight than “promoting the  
general welfare". The Preamble  
states "We the people...in order to  
form a more perfect union, estab-  
lish justice and ensure domestic  
tranquility, to provide for the  
common defense and promote the gen-  
eral welfare, and secure the blessings  
of liberty for ourselves and our  
posterity..."

Berry said that asking for social  
“programs is very constitutional and  
that we have to insist that social  

justice is a priority.

She said that we must make repre-  

sentatives accountable and we  
have to know who they are, if we  
are to make our democracy work. She  
urged people not to fall into the  
trap of accepting false assumptions  
or incomplete analyses of social  

She specifically addressed the  
criticisms of past social programs  
and admitted that many didn't work.  
She also pointed out that just  
because they didn't work, there is  
no need to deny the truth about the  
necessity for the programs even if  
not successful. Many programs in  
the 60s and 70s had built-in prob-  
lems, almost guaranteeing long-term  
failure, and that many current crit-  
icisms of welfare, affirmative action,  
school desegregation, etc., are accu-  
rate, but it is racism, and speci-  
fically institutional racism, which  
fuels and perpetuates a system that  
traps people and then blames them  
for being failures. She also said  
one of the most depressing things  
is that people you know got their  
success because of affirmative action,  
can be those who are most vocifer-  
ously against the idea. In Berry's  
opinion, affirmative action is not  
only the right thing to do, but it  
works.

She ended her presentation with  
a call to not abandon the high  
principles of the constitution,  
civil rights and democracy. The  
constitution is not the problem, it  
is color blind now, but we are not  
color blind.

Much in this society is racist,  
tolerates racism and even promotes  
it, she said. "We need to believe  

“that the bank of justice is not  
bankrupt...", that there is justice  
we can strive for. We have an obli-  
gation to seek justice. Those inter-  
ested in seeking justice must stand  
with those who do not tolerate in-  
justice, who will "heap burning coals"  
on everything and burn away injustice.

POLITICAL PROCESS

The schedule of this conference  
also included several small group  
workshops to choose from.

The workshop on “Racism in the  
Political Process" covered the  
historical roots of racism in the  
political arena, individual and in-  

PAGE 12. COMMON GROUND

stitutional ramifications of racism  
in government and what racism means  
in the present and in the future.

Mr. Lamophe, a representative  
from United Automobile Workers,  
talked about the roots of racism in  
the political process. He outlined  
how Blacks were forced into a subser-  
vient position by slavery, lack of  
voting rights, and lack of oppor-  
tunity to own property. "The rights  
of safety, security and the right  
to a good life for Blacks was solely  
at the whim of whites, who, by law,  
did not have to respect those rights,"  
said Lamophe.

About this presidential adminis-  
tration, he said, “They are waging  
a deliberate, conscious and willful  
assault on civil rights. For Black  
people, it is back to basics, using  
the power of voting rights.”

Paula Rosner, head of the local  
American Civil Liberties Union,  
made a personal plea for personal  
activism and coalition building,  
in her talk about “Individual Racism  
as it relates to the Political Pro-  
cess". Ms. Rosner, whose roots are  
Hispanic, offered a perspective on  
activism and the promotion of leader-  

ship qualities in minority communities.

Minnie Gillette, a veteran of  
Buffalo politics and coordinator  
of the Victim-Witness Assistance  

Program spoke on "Facets of Racism  

in the Political Process". She dis-  
cussed institutional racism on both  
federal and local levels. She said,  
“Racism in America occurs naturally,  
and happens often without comment."  
Of 500,000 elected posts in the  
United States, only 5,200 are held  
by Blacks.

Ms. Gillette blamed racist media  
for poor treatment of Black candi-  
dates and office holders. She said  
that Black politicians are watched  
more closely and scrutinized more  
carefully than are their white coun-  
terparts.

On the local and federal level,  
Ms. Gillette said that the trend is  
toward increased minority participa-  
tion in the political scene.

Will Brown, official in the local  
Civil Service Commission, who spoke  
on "Institutional Racism in the  
Public Sector" defined racism as  
“the power to carry out systematic  
discrimination".

"Public institutions in this  
country have a great power to reward  
or penalize," he said. Those insti-  
tutions have incorporated racist  
attitudes, therefore subordinating  
individuals or groups on the basis  
of color. In 1973, he said, Blacks  
were only 2% of the city workforce.  
Court orders finally forced parity  
in hiring.

"Racism takes two forms,” he  
said, “individual, white against  
Black, and the whole white vs. the  
total Black community."

Hope Hoetzer, who is a member of  
many local politically-oriented  
groups, related some personal ex-  
periences on being female and on  
being Jewish in this society. "I  
was surprised to find that in some  
circles, I wasn't considered white,"  
she said.

She spoke on internalized racism,  
saying that "it is the best tool  
that the majority uses to keep us  
apart," and that “horizontal hostil-  
ity among minorities prevents coali-  
tion building on important issues."

Ms. Hoetzer analyzed the "myth of  
the melting pot" saying that people  
need not lose their individual cul-  
tures." We can transcend the things  
that separate us, and find the things  
that unite us.

"We cannot afford to be complac-  
ent," Ms. Hoetzer said. “We must  
go beyond the recognition that  
there is an enemy. We must learn  
the process from going from the  
outside to the inside.”

RACISM IN MEDIA

The “Racism in the Media” workshop  
moderated by Frances L. Murphy, was  
a participatory workshop, where  
both panelists and audience were  
encouraged to add input to the  
discussion.

Dr. Diane Hope of the Rochester  
Institute of Technology, whose spe-  
cialty is the representation of  

JUNE 1984

minorities in films, discussed both  
the representation of Blacks in  
film and the film industry. "The  
making of films by the film industry  
is the creation of American myth-  
ology," she said. She added that  
the largest audience for movies is  
teenagers, whom the industry has  
decided do not want to be in touch  
with reality.

W. Asante, another panelist,  
said that the electronic media is  
not much better. He expressed con-  
cern that Black media superstars  
are not good role models for children  
and that programs like "The Jeffer-  
sons" do not foster a positive image  
of Black families.

Carl Allen, a reporter for the  
Buffalo News described his personal  
experiences as a Black reporter for  
a white-owned daily newspaper.

Participants in the workshop  
were encouraged to examine the mis-  
representation and lack of represen-  
tation of Blacks in all the media  
and to offer solutions to the prob-  
lem.

IMPACT OF RACISM  
ON THE  
ECONOMY  
Another workshop was titled  
“Impact of Racism on the Economy”.

Ms. Geraldine Memmo, moderator for  
this workshop, focused on identi-  

fying racism and the results of racism.

She said it was hard to put a finger  
on it sometimes, but that a "I know  
it when I see it" response is common.  
She asked the panelists and parti-  
cipants: "Can you recognize it?  
How does it impact? Do you see  
racism in housing patterns, plant  
relocations or industry mobility?"  
Memmo spoke briefly on the rise  
of a Black middle class, produced  
partly because of the support of  
affirmative action, and said that  
the Black middle class is much mis-  
understood and a subject of scorn.  
Harkening back to her opening  
remarks about racism in plant relo-  
cations and industry mobility, she  
said that adverse effects of plant  
closings and relocations on minori-  
ties is not illegal, but plant relo-  
cation would violate Title VII of  
the Civil Rights Act if an employer  
does not make sure equal employment  
opportunity exists if the relocation  
is to an area where substantial num-  
bers of minorities do not reside.  
Larry Diggs spoke next on Insti-  
tutional Racism in the public sector.  
He read a definition of institutional  
racism, “Institutions have a great  
power to reward and penalize. They  
reward by providing career opportun-  
ities for some people and foreclosing  
them for others. They reward as well,  
by the way social goods are distrib-  
uted--by deciding who receives  
training and skills, medical care,  
formal education, political influ-  
ence, moral support and self-respect,  
productive employment, fair treat-  
ment by the law, decent housing,  
self-confidence and the promise of  

a secure future for self and children."

Some of the most conspicuous exam-  
ples of racism's impact are on deli-  
very of services, program develop-  
ment, determination of allocations,  
promotion and salary structures,  
spending for services and attitudes  
toward minorities. He went on to  
show statistically how the impact  
of poverty and unemployment weighs  
disproportionately on Blacks, His-  
panics and women, at a time when the  
Federal Civil Rights Budget was cut  
25% and the range of affirmative  
action policies was cut. He cited  
the following: 35.6% of Blacks and  
29.9% of Hispanics are "officially"  
poor. 40.6% of female headed house-  
holds are officially poor. The offi-  
cial rate of poverty is on the rise,  
he said.

He stated that racism also costs  
money, and that all the money we  
spend trying to eliminate it, or  
fight instances of it could be  
better spent on jobs and social  
programs. Instead, we spend it on  
a racist system that shouldn't be.  
Nationally, we spent $1 billion  
fighting the effects of racism last  
year. Eliminating racism is in  
everyone's best interest economically.

Terry McElvie spoke directly to  
what he saw as the lynchpin or  
fundamental underlying support for  
racism in this society. He said,  
"Racism must be recognized as an  
integral part of society in this  
country...It is grounded in a deep-  
seated belief in [white people's]  
superiority because of race...per-  
petuated by the idea that [our]  
Supreme Being [God] is of one race  
rather than another.”

He continued to say when the  
dominant race has God on their side,  
both the dominant race [white] and  
the subordinated race [non-white]  
can internalize this. The dominant  

race, picturing God as like themselves,  

and themselves as God-like, believes  
in its superiority, and the subordin-  
ated race believes in its own infer-  
iority. This deep-rooted, psycho-  
logical behavior retards the sub-  
ordinated race's ability to break  
through and see success, and non-  
subordination as even possible.

He emphasized that only after  
success is seen to be possible,  
and referred to "Black Pride" as an  
example of this, can Blacks make  
use of technical information, job  
training, etc.

In the general discussion which  
followed, there was some dialogue be-  
tween two white women and the rest  
of the room about whether or not all  
white people were, by definition,  
racist. The panel and most present  
said yes they were, and there en-  
sued a discussion of the responsi-  
bilities of Black and white people  
to combat racism. It was emphasized  
that racism is not the same as preju-  
dice, that racism means power.  
Because a particular white person  
is not prejudiced against minorities,  
they are still racist, by definition,  
because they are accorded power,  
whether they choose to exercise it  
or not. “Progress for white people  
on their own racism can only occur  
when the white admits and internal-  

izes it," said one participant. "Many  
whites are unconscious of their own  
racist behavior and when called out  
on it, are surprised or offended,"  
said another. After all, the person  
may not have “meant" anything bad or  
been aware they were being oppressive,  
so they are guilty and/or defensive about  
it. It nevertheless is racist  
behavior. Another participant said,  
“Blacks must be careful not to be-  
come the teacher of their oppressors.  
It takes too much energy and is not  
worth it." Whites were clearly  
charged with the responsibility not  
to deny racism exists, even in the  
most well-intentioned person, and to  
actively discover racism and racist  
attitudes.

Part two of the Racism Conference  
report, including further workshop  
summaries and analysis, will be  
carried in next month's issue of  
Common Ground.
