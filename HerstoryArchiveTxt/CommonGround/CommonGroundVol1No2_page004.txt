Dear Common Ground,  
First issue is a great success.

Dear Common Ground,  

I enjoyed your first issue very much—  
keep up the excellent work!

Dear Common Ground,  

I read "Barriers to Health Care for the  
Disabled." It is difficult for me to go  
up and down stairs. I am a disabled  
adult. (I have) cerebral palsy and am  
in a wheelchair. I type with a head-  
wand. Doctors always think I am men-  
tally retarded. I am slow in reading  
and in math. That is because I have  
dyslexia. Also, my teachers never  
taught much about this because they  
said I was stupid. I hate being called  
mentally retarded. Doctors should not  
assume people are stupid just be-  

cause they have C.P.

Dear Editors:  

Congratulations on your first issue of  
Common Ground. I commend you for pro-  
ducing such a comprehensive community  
news journal. Best of luck in con-  
tinuing your endeavor to collect and  
communicate such a wealth of infor-  

I do, however, take issue with the con-  
tents of an ad placed by Assemblywoman  
Carol Siwek. By stating that she is the  
"only woman in the State Legislature  
from Western New York," she infers that  
women have a vehicle in Carol Siwek  

to communicate their views. This is  
not necessarily the case: In 1982  
Ms. Siwek voted against Medicaid  
funding for abortion.  

I think it is crucial that Common  
Ground protect the integrity of its  
contents by being selective about  

the acceptance of paid advertisements.  
This is especially important in view of  
your stated goals involving poor,  
minority women.  

The defeat of the ERA did not mark the  
end of feminist political activity.  

On the contrary, more women are enter-  
ing electoral politics and partici-  
pating in the political process than  
ever before. But we must be careful  
not to equate being a woman with being  
pro-feminist on issues. Phyllis  
Schlafly, arch-enemy of the ERA, is a  
woman; Norma Gabler, the censorship  
mogul from Texas, is a woman. And Judie  
Brown, director of the American Life  
Lobby, is a woman.  

Our elected officials must be measured  
by their voting records. Siwek's  
demonstrates that the Assemblywoman  
is not fully committed to the health  
rights of all women.  

Once again, I wish you success with  
Common Ground.  

Sincerely,  

Joanne L. Steinmetz, Buffalo  

Dear Common Ground Collective,  
Congratulations on a very well done  

first issue! I'm sure you've heard  
this over and over, but it doesn't  
hurt to say it again... You've done a  
wonderful job in providing the women  
of Western New York with a vehicle for  
feminists to communicate with each  
other. Hopefully, CARASA will submit  
articles in the future to Common  
Ground on reproductive rights, as we  
do not currently have a newsletter  

of our own.  

In the spirit of supportive crit-  
icism, we want to comment on the Carol  
Siwek ad on page 18 of your first  
issue. Although Carol Siwek may be the  
only woman in the state legislature  
from WNY, she is not a feminist. In  
her last campaign, she accepted the  
endorsement of the Right-To-Life  
Party. Her voting record has been  
ultra-conservative on issues of  
abortion rights, Medicaid funding for  
abortion, and parental consent-  
notification bills. As a reproductive  
rights group, it was very discon-  
certing to see her ad in a publication  
which many women will respect and  
rely on.  

One of our concerns is that many of  
us tend to vote for female candidates  
when we have no other basis on which  
to make a decision between candidates.  
Carol Siwek is an example of how she  
advertised in Common Ground may seem  
to be an implicit endorsement.  

When reading over your Policy  
Statement on page 2, I could  
not find any policy regarding adverti-  
sers. It would be difficult to make a  
policy in which Common Ground would  
not accept ads from people/businesses  
who continue the oppression of women,  
who want to maintain the status quo.  
This kind of policy would be hard,  

(if not impossible) to enforce. But it  
seems that it should be possible to  
screen out advertisers who are  
blatantly anti-feminist. Any candidate  
who runs on the RTLP line should be  
considered anti-feminist, and not in  
keeping with your own policy commit-  
ment to “enhance the lives of women  
on physical, educational, spiritual,  
psychological, social and economic  
levels." Without the right to  
decide when and if we have children,  
women will continue to be oppressed,  
not enhanced.  

We urge you to consider these  
thoughts within the Common Ground  
Collective. We hope you decide not  
to provide a forum for those who do  
not support us. And keep up the  
Good Work!

Dear Common Ground,

COMMON GROUND  

To the Collective:  

I would like to congratulate you  
on putting together an excellent paper.  
I am one of your first subscribers.  

Unfortunately, I was distressed by  
an item in the announcements section.  
It was from the Catholic diocese  
looking for 'pro-life' volunteers to  
staff their alleged women's health  
services hotline.  

I consider the ad in direct  
violation of editorial policy #4  
which states: "the collective will not  
intentionally print or support  
materials or viewpoints which will  
harm women because of color, sexuality,  
religious or ethnic background,  
physical ability or economic situ-  
ation."  

The Catholic Church is anti-choice  
for women; it is also anti-birth  
control. The mention of 'pro-life'  
means the diocese supports the Church's  
stand on abortion. The Church does  
not support abortion for any reason  
including saving the mother's life.  
They very much support any human life  
amendment.  

I was offended. This is a direct  
attack on women's health, sexuality,  
not to mention emotional well-being.  

A human life amendment would make the  
I.U.D. and the mini-pill illegal,  

They do not prevent conception, only  
implantation of the fertilized egg.  

I must also say that it would be  
detrimental to my health to bear my  
rapist's child.  

I hope that announcement was only  
a temporary aberration on your part.  

If not, I may consider canceling my  
subscription. I do not want my money  

being used in any way that could  

support anti-choice, anti-woman groups.  

Sincerely,  

Penny Klein, Buffalo.  

From Us To You  

ABOUT LETTERS TO THE EDITOR:  

This space is reserved for our  
readership and community members to  
tell us what they like, don't like  
or wish we'd do differently. We do  
not expect anyone to agree with  
everything printed in Common  
Ground. If something tickles you,  
infuriates you, makes you think or  
want to respond, we think that is  
great: We expect our readership to  
help us strike a balance, search  

out new ideas, options and view-  
points. We hope you understand the  
approach we have taken with our  

editorial policy: we are providing  
access to ideas, and even if you  

disagree with something presented,  
we think we have helped you  

strengthen your own point of view.  
Better still, you might find a new  
way of looking at something, or  

gather an insight into how other  

women make their choices.  

Common Ground is a reader-sponsored  
paper, and therefore is also a  

reader-responsive paper. As much  
as is possible, we will be open to  
our readership about who we are and  
how we make our decisions.  

Please write! Letters will be  
printed on a space-available basis,  
and dependent on the timeliness of  
the issue. Thank you,  

OCTOBER 1982
