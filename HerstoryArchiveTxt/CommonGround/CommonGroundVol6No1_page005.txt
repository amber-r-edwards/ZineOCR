**Co-Parenting: Option for the Eighties**

by Lynne Scribner

Linda is a 33-year-old mother
of a 6-year-old daughter. If that
was where my description of their
life together stopped, the impres-
sion most people would have is
that of a heterosexual mother.

But Linda is a lesbian mother.
She, her partner, Joy, and daugh-
ter Justine are a family. Having
Justine was not a conscious deci-
sion for Linda, but her daughter's
birth has added a special dimen-
sion to her life. Linda and Joy
are co-parents to Justine. They
both share in all aspects of child
rearing. Linda said that she is a
fairly strict mother, but that
this has worked well with Justine.
Justine's father (who is also gay)
sees her regularly—on weekends
and during vacations. She is

also in contact with her grandpar-
ents on both sides, her aunts on
her mother's side, and her uncle
on her father's side. Linda there-
fore sees no problem with Justine
having male role models in her
life. As it was, when I arrived
at their house, Justine was busily
playing outside on the porch with
two little boys.

I asked Linda whether she would
want another child in the future
and she said yes, that she and Joy
were planning on it in another two
years. Linda said she planned on
having the child herself, but had

not ruled out adoption as an alter-
native. When she was pregnant
with Justine she was hoping for a
girl (and would still prefer an-
other girl) but thinks she'd be
better prepared to raise a boy
if she had one.

I had expected Linda to tell me
about the difficulties and prob-
lems she has encountered with
teachers, friends, other parents,
co-workers, etc., but, somewhat
surprisingly given the conserva-
tive nature of the area, she has
not found much resistance. She
has told Justine's teachers that
she is a gay parent and Joy attends

They publish periodic updates on

a source list of agencies, the
various requirements of a specific
agency, and the current situation
in a given country for single
adoption.

There is also a booklet avail-
able from the U.S. Immigration and
Naturalization Service, INS Infor-
mation Booklet for Parents Adopt-
ing from Abroad. It is recommended
that women get this as they begin
the process, rather than later in
the process. Being aware of rules
and regulations and following some
of the steps in the booklet may
save time and hassle later. Single
copies are available free from:

parent-teacher meetings with her.
(Justine's father has also attended
parents' nights.) Some of the
parents of Justine's friends know
about Linda and Joy, as do their
friends (both gay and straight).
Linda said that most of her
straight friends accept her with
no problem. As for her co-workers,
Linda said many of them are gay
themselves, and those who are not
have no problem dealing with her
being a gay parent. The only real
time Linda experienced any negative
feedback was when she was pregnant
with Justine. Many of her friends
couldn't accept her being gay and
being pregnant. They evidently
felt that those two situations
were incompatible. But once she
had Justine everything was fine.

I also had the chance to meet
Justine and talk a little bit with
her. I found her to be an intelli-
gent, thoughtful, and well-adjusted
six-year-old. She seems to have
had no problems so far in accepting
and dealing with the fact that
her mother and Joy are partners.
Justine is also a very artistic
child (she drew a picture for me
which is included here). The
family is getting ready to move
to Connecticut in the near future.
Justine has mixed feelings about
moving and leaving her father and
friends. However, they have two
cats that will be going with them,

so this should make it a little
easier for her.

Linda ended by saying that she
feels they have been lucky in not
encountering any problems. She
also said that she thinks Justine
will grow up without prejudice
toward people as she gets older
and will have a liberal attitude.
Linda says she doesn't care whether
Justine turns out heterosexual or
gay, as long as she can be herself
and be a happy person. This is a
philosophy I wholeheartedly agree
with.

In concluding, I want to thank
Linda and Joy for letting me into
their lives for an afternoon. I
think it should be noted that per-
haps people's biggest problem in
dealing with the issue of lesbian
motherhood is in its connotation.
Lesbian mothers want the same things
for their children that straight
mothers do—they want the best for
their children, want them to be
happy and healthy, and as Linda
said, want them to wear clean
underwear when going to the doc-
tor's office. Maybe if we could
learn to leave it at that, we'd
all be much better off.
