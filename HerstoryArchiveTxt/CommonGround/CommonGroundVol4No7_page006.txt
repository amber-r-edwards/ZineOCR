**Recovery**

by Charlotte Churchill

You may be a housewife suffering  
from anxiety, depression or fear, or  
a professional unable to cope with  
stress, or a mental patient who has  
been hospitalized. These are a few  
of the types of people who might  
benefit from Recovery, Inc., a self-  
help community mental health resource.  
It is a proven method of self-help  
care for the purposes of preventing  
relapses in former mental patients.  
The Recovery method is a system of  
techniques for controlling temper-  
amental behavior and changing atti-  
tudes toward nervous symptoms and  
fears. Symptoms may include heart  
palpitations, dizziness, shortness of  
breath, sweats, depression, fatigue,  
headaches, numbness, tremors, sleep-  
lessness, and chest pressure. Some  
have fears of being alone or of  
crowds, of people, journeys, closed  
or open spaces, eating, choking, and  
especially the fear of making mis-  
takes. Others have obsessions, com-  
pulsions, and bizarre thoughts.

People from all walks of life at-  
tend Recovery meetings because they  
share a common problem -- nervous  
symptoms and fears. Some of the  
people at Recovery meetings have  
been hospitalized at one time; some  
are still under the care of a doc-  
tor or other professional. Others  
simply have read about Recovery or  
have heard about it from a friend or  
a relative.

Recovery was founded in 1937 by  
the late Abraham A. Low, M.D. It  
has been completely patient-managed  
since 1952. There are about 1,000  
weekly group meetings in the U.S.,  
Canada, Puerto Rico, Ireland and the  
United Kingdom.

Each Recovery meeting has a simi-  
lar structure. Members read a chap-  
ter of the book Mental Health Through  
Will Training written by Dr. Abraham  
A. Low, Recovery's founder, or they  
hear one of his taped lectures. Ex-  
amples are then given to show how  
members are learning to use Recovery's  
self-help method. After a brief  
question period the meeting becomes  
more informal and members may talk  
in small groups.

Recovery is a completely independent,  
self-supporting organization.  
There is no fee, but a voluntary  
collection is taken at each meeting.  
To get started, simply attend a  
meeting -- the list follows. Meet-  
ings last two hours. If you wish,  
you may bring a friend or relative  
with you. The meetings are for  
those over age 18. For additional  
information write: Recovery, Inc.,  
15 Webster St., North Tonawanda,  
N.Y. 14120. Telephone: 716-695-  
1048.

**HEROINES**

by Sharon Green

You may have read my short piece  
in the February issue of CG on the  
two women astronauts about to take  
off in the space shuttle Challenger.  
As both a mother and a teacher, I  
felt a bond with Christa McAuliffe.  
As a woman, I was struck by the often-  
repeated media pictures of Christa  
and astronaut Judith Resnick (who was  
on a previous flight and became the se-  
cond American woman in space) working  
and practicing together.

On the same day that our February  
issue came back from the printer, the  
shuttle Challenger blew up just moments  
after liftoff, in full view of family  
members, spectators and TV viewers.  
All seven astronauts, including these  
two women, were killed instantly.

My shock, my disbelief, and my  
dependence on TV for any snippet of  
information reminded me of my reac-  
tions to President John F. Kennedy's  
assassination, when I was 12 years  
old. Yet Kennedy, an upper-class  
man, much older than me, was a famous  
yet distant figure. Christa McAuliffe,  
and to a lesser extent Judith Resnick,  
were people with whom I could identify.  
This made Christa’s glorification by  
the media even more unique to me. So  
this tragedy hit me on a more personal  
level.

Because these two women were ground-  
breakers (only one other, Sally Ride,  
has gone into space for the United  
States), and because they received so  
much media attention, I hope they did  
not die in vain. As the disaster in-  
vestigation continues, many questions  
are being raised about flawed parts,  
human error and time pressures. Such  
reports are most discouraging since  
they suggest that lives were lost  
needlessly.

Yes, it was an immense tragedy;  
especially for the families of all  
seven astronauts. Yes, it will be  
long remembered by millions of school  
children, just as we adults recall  
the events of November 22, 1963. But  
let's hope that when they remember the  
Challenger explosion, they will also  
remember that McAuliffe and Resnick  
were women doing something that,  
even a generation earlier, would have  
seemed too outrageous to dream of.

McAuliffe, who was to have been  
the first teacher in space, has al-  
ready been nominated to the National  
Women's Hall of Fame in Seneca Falls,  
New York. Both she and Resnick are  
not only heroines who died in pur-  
suit of knowledge; they are also  
heroines who helped show girls and  
young women just how far their ima-  
ginations, and their lives, can  
stretch.
