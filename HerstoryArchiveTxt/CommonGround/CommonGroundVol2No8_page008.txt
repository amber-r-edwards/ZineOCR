INTERVIEW:  
ALEX DOBKIN  

have told me that before they came  
they thought I was "off the wall",  
that they were scared to come, or  
uncomfortable with what I talk about,  
threatened by what I had to say or  
what they thought I had to say, but  
that now they understand. I come  
across that quite frequently. Some  

of my audience has grown with me, and  
my audience seems to be fairly loyal  
and devoted. More and more women are  
coming to the concerts. I think that  
women are used to ideas that were  
shocking years ago and they're not  

so alarmed...At least I hope so. It  
relates back to women-only space.  
Women are comfortable now who were  
not a few years ago.  

BROOKE: I know that Adrian, your  
daughter, is a young teen. Do you  
see young women coming to concerts?  

ALIX: I see young women being more  
influenced by popular music which is  
positive about women and women to-  
gether. How that relates to "Women's  
Music" I'm not sure. Young women  
expect to play lead instruments,  
drums or bass, on the whole women are  
more confident and have more options.  
Now, influential mainstream music  
incorporates the assumptions and  
analysis of feminism, whether they  
know it or not. Young women are de-  
manding more respect and equal treat-  
ment than they thought they had any  
claim on before.  

BROOKE: Anything I haven't asked  
about that you'd like to comment on?  

ALIX: Just that it's important for  
lesbians to have a good time, to have  
fun. I think lots of lesbians are  
learning that you can still be right-  
eous and have fun. That's why I try  
to make my concerts entertaining as  
well as inspiring. After all, "The  
girls just want to have fun."  

...Alix Dobkin will be in Buffalo  

for a concert Saturday, May 5, at the  
Church of the Ascension, Linwood and  
North, 8 P.M. sharp, and for a pot-  
luck Sunday. Advance tickets available  
at EMMA.

REVIEW  

Stanton &  
Anthony;  
Together  
Again  

by Chris Van Veghten  

Stanton and Anthony Together Again  

is a biographical drama which explores  
and attempts to define the relation-  
ship between these two 19th century  
women, while illuminating the major  
events and accomplishments in their  
lives.  

Sponsored by the YWCA of Buffalo  
and Erie County, this dramatization  
in one act was presented at D'Youville  

College on March 23 to a disappointingly  

small, but diverse crowd.  

The contrast in personality between  
these two historic figures in the  
women's movement was striking--Stan-  
ton, the idealist; Anthony, the real-  
ist. Stanton was the writer, synthe-  
sizer, the goad, the action; while  
Anthony was the stalwart. We  
learn that they both had their roots  
in the abolition movement, and we see  
them fired by one another's ideas and  
moving to the forefront of the battle  
for women's rights.  

The play is informative in many  
ways, showing us the first and second  
Women's Rights Conventions in Seneca  
Falls, the battle for the fourteenth  
amendment, Anthony's trial for her  
attempt to vote, and Stanton's 80th  
birthday celebration. We see these  
two women, in their 50 year associa-  
tion, move into the 20th century,  
still radical and uncompromising, as  
the publication of Stanton's The  
Woman's Bible late in her life would  
indicate. They both died (Stanton  

in 1902, Anthony in 1906) never seeing  
their dream of a woman's right to  
vote fulfilled.  

The play itself is a bit too self-  
congratulatory, as these women, the  
only two players, describe one an-  
other's accomplishments. Few of  
their own faults and few other women  
who were instrumental in their strug-  
gles are mentioned. These two women,  
though prominent in the struggle then,  
do little to enlighten us on some of  
the names and events hidden by our  
traditional history.  

The playwright, Lee Bollinger-Longo  
had to do extensive research to un-  
earth data on even these well-known  
figures and prolific writers. An  
enjoyable and informative addition to  
the evening was the playwright's  
appearance on stage with the players  
at the end of the performance to an-  
swer a variety of questions from the  
audience on the background of the  
characters and the research involved  

in the writing.  

Bollinger-Longo is doing a contin-  
uing series of this type of dramati-  
zation. Both prominent and lesser  
known women, such as Charlotte Perkins  
Gilman, George Sand and Virginia  
Woolf, are presented. She has formed  
a non-profit organization for the  
presentation of these dramas, Women's  
Arts/Visual Enterprises (WAVE), and  
can be contacted at P.O. Box 7033,  
Hampton, N.H. 03842.  

For details, call the YWCA at 875-3111.
