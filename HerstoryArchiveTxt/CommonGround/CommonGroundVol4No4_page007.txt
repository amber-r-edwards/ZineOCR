ONLY

by Hope Hoetzer

As a child, I was quite unaware
that Judaism was regarded as a "pa-
ternal" religion, although I was a-
cutely aware Jews were not Christ-
ians. I enjoyed being the Other,
enjoyed the specialness it meant for
holidays I explained to my friends,
enjoyed knowing the secret of Santa
Claus, enjoyed knowing I had a his-
tory of thousands of years. My Ju-
daism was inseparable from my fami-
ly; it lived in the center of hearth
and home through the women with a
strength we could feel even as small
children.

The women were memory, the past
in the present that made sentient
who we were, where we came from, the
responsibility of investing each
child with this awareness of what it
was to be ourselves and to be Jews.
In college, I studied how central to
Jewish belief is the matrilinear line,
a tribal vestige that could indicate
primitive Hebrew associations with
goddess worship or at least some cen-
tral female myth. For me, it was so
because—as Boba said—women are the
keepers of the home and the children,
we are responsible for teaching Ju-
daism and ethics. Maintaining a Jew-

PAGAN BABIES

by Gerri Bayer

When I was in third grade

The Goddess is important for
catechism class, the elderly
nun who taught us encouraged us
to donate our pennies to the "rulers" of it. The Goddess sym-
bol frees men to experience the
female side of their natures—
deep and nurturing. Women can
experience the male aspect of the
Goddess—the Hunter, the "Horned
One" who offers us wild, untamed
energy, who is the bringer of
Light.

The image “pagan babies"
brought forth in my young mind
was one of small, dark infants
in grass skirts with bones in
their coifs. I always gave my
pennies, lest these innocents
(who, of course, had no choice
about whether they would be
baptized) ended up in purgatory
(a gray place filled with basin-
ettes) where all unbaptized
children without benefit of sacra-
ment landed.

Pagan brings another picture
now. There are no grass skirts,
no bones, no basinettes; just
a strong, loving woman, who is
home is the Schul we keep holy, and
home is the center of the family.
When I once asked her why only the
men washed their hands ritually, she
replied—with humour and belief—
"Because women are always clean. Each
time our hands are in water we're
washed—as we prepare the dishes,
the food, the children—we don't need
a special ritual." And she always
said a B'rochah.

My great-grandmother was the el-
dest, her first child was my grand-
mother, my mother her first daughter.
All of them are so strong as presen-
ces in my mind that I consult them
for their help. They were as in-
separable from their Judaism as from
the soft Yiddish they spoke that al-
ways sounded to me like the sound of
the prayer. I was the child eager to
know "the stories," to sit with the
adults even when I did not understand,
to handle the old photographs like
sacred objects and to breathe in the
warm, comforting smells of a kosher
home on a Friday afternoon. I in-
herited from them a stoicness that
makes it easier to cry when I am
touched gently than if I am attacked.
Eltra Boba. I remember sitting
in the tenement window, brushing
waist-length white wisps of hair
tinged red: “An olt voman shouldn't
hef red hair still," as she braided

Everything is interde-
pendent and inter-related, so
that the natural course is to
honor all things for her/his/its
intrinsic value.

We consider our rituals “magic"—
that is feeling and molding the
forces that are an unseen part
of our world, reaching deeper
levels of consciousness and
awakening some of the forgotten
powers of the human mind.

The Goddess is present in all
of us and in everything; there
is no "power over." There is
the power of self and the percep-
tion that we are the divinity and
as the divinity, the power of all
things is in us.

Blessed be.
