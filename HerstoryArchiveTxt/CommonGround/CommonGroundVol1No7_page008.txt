10th ANNIVERSARY OF LEGALIZED ABORTION

Dear Common Ground:

Buffalo CARASA planned two events for  
January 22. In the morning, CARASA had  
a 50 person picket protesting the local  
Right-to-Life Committee's motorcade  
which was led by a hearse. We maintained  
to the media that the "funeral"  

procession better dramatized the death  
of women following illegal abortions.  
As the RTL motorcade passed our sidewalk  
picket, our chanting voices rose  
to the occasion and filled the canyons  
of the city streets. This excitement  
created a solidarity which carried us  
throughout the day. Saturday evening,  

we held a celebration of Women Working  
for Women's Rights; the celebration  
included a coffeehouse with women performers,  
a champagne toast to the reproductive  
rights movement, and dancing to a Latin  
music band. It was an exciting day.  
The spirit of accomplishment and celebration  
was in the air.  

It was not in the media however.  

The Buffalo News published an extremely  
biased story in their Sunday paper,  
despite the fact that they had a  
positive pro-choice editorial in the  
paper on Saturday, January 22. Two  
CARASA members talked to the reporter  
covering the RTL motorcade; he stated  
that he did not want to talk to them,  
because he had been assigned to only  
cover the RTL motorcade. He did give  
the picket one mention in his article,  
underestimating the number of protestors  
by 50%.  

The press was friendly compared to  
the local politicians. First of all,  
Erie County Executive Ed Rutkowski  
(former Buffalo Bills football player  
and buddy to Jack Kemp) proclaimed  
January 22 as "Right-to-Life Day" in  
Erie County. According to one of his  
aides, Rutkowski made the proclamation  
because it was "historically appropriate"  
(whatever that means). Secondly, the RTL  
Committee somehow obtained a motorcade  
permit from the city of Buffalo for 50 cars.  
When CARASA has had motorcades on two  
occasions in the past year, our permits  
allowed a maximum of 25 cars. Why?  

Although the local press and politicians  
put up obstacles all around us and  
attempted to isolate us out of existence,  
CARASA prevailed and we found ourselves  
pictured in the NY Times, The NY Daily  
News, and on Saturday Night Live news Update!  

That kind of media exposure can keep  
us energized for another ten years!

IN PARTIAL RESPONSE TO LISA'S LETTER:  

The women's dance rotation committee met  
the evening of February 19th. Although  
many present believed in the concept and  
need for women's dances, concerns were  
voiced about falling attendance and rising  
costs at these events. It was tentatively  
decided to hold dances (and possibly  
alternative activities) three to four  
times a year, and alternative arrangements  
for finances, publicity, etc. were also  
discussed.  

The committee is meeting again on March 6th  
to get feedback on these ideas from the  
organizations involved, and it hopes to  
publish an article in the April issue of  
CG detailing not only the final decisions  
of this meeting, but also providing some  
herstory of the development of the dance  
rotation committee and what functions it  
has hoped to serve. If organizations are  
interested in participating, or if  
individuals would like to give input,  
please leave a message at EMMA, 885-2285.  

AN OPEN LETTER TO BUFFALO WOMEN WHO  
REMEMBER OUR WOMEN'S DANCES & TO THE  
WOMEN'S GROUPS WHO USED TO SPONSOR THEM  

Tax Information for Women  

By Linda Rader, CPA  

This is Part II of a three-part  
series of income tax questions most  
often asked by women. See Part I in  
February's Common Ground for a  
resource listing.  

Q - I am separated from my husband.  
Can I file a joint return with  
him for 1982? Should I?  

A - The concept of marital status  
for income tax purposes is NOT  
the same as your legal marital  
status. Your income tax marital  
status determines which tax tables  
you use, and thus, the amount of  
tax you pay:  
- Married  
- Single  
- Head of Household  
- Joint Filing or  
- Separate  

For several years up until about six  
months ago, a group of Buffalo women's  
organizations (including EMMA, Gay  
Rights for Older Women, The Buffalo  
Women's Liberation Union, Women's  
Studies College, Simple Gifts, The  
Buffalo Women's Production Company  
- were there others?) came together  
to sponsor monthly women's dances.  
These groups rotated the dance sponsorship  
and assumed financial responsibilities--  
this included rental of a local church  
hall, refreshments, publicity, set-up &  
staffing the hall, paying a DJ, etc.  
A stereo system traveled from group to  
group. It had been handed down by a  
defunct women's group to be used for  
these social gatherings. The women's  
groups were not doing these dances to  
collect “big bucks"; I saw these events  
as limited or no money makers that  
were done to provide Buffalo women  
with a social space.  

These dances were an alternative to  
the bars for many women in this city---  
a bit less smoky, not as loud, and  
certainly an event many of us looked  
forward to monthly. About 6 months  
ago, these dances stopped happening.  

It is my understanding that with  
increased costs, the events were losing  
money heavily and the groups could  
not afford to give us these dances any  
longer. It is also my understanding  
that fewer and fewer women were attending  
these dances as well. Also,  
woman energy in the groups was low.  

I am disappointed and saddened  
and angry that the groups involved in  
our women's dance rotation did not  
attempt to find other ways to bring us  
these dances, or make a public  
announcement about the ending of the  
dance rotation and the reasons why.  

I think I am not alone--lots of us  
don't even know any reasons why these  
dances stopped! Agreed--the costs have  
skyrocketed. But there are ways to  
pull it off! Why not try co-sponsorship  
and/or dances every other month?  
If an event is scheduled, publicity  
must be out and well circulated. I be-  
lieve that there was a correlation be-  
tween the poorly attended dances and  
late, minimal publicity efforts.  

I ask the groups who've sponsored  
our dances not to give up! And I ask  
other women who feel the same as I  
do to write Common Ground and air  
your views! Thank you dance rotation  
women's groups for your past work--  
let's make it happen again! And thanks  
CG for being here.  

Sincerely,  
Lisa Albrecht  

If other women's organizations are  
interested in participating, or if  
individuals would like to give input,  
please leave a message at EMMA, 885-2285.  

Marital status is determined as of  
the LAST day of the tax year.  

You COULD file a joint return with  
your husband, even if you were not  
living with him at the end of the  
year, if you have not yet been  
awarded a decree of separate main-  
tenance (separation or divorce),  
and did live together part of the  
year. The total tax paid when  
filing jointly is almost always  
less than the sum of the two taxes  
if each files as married-filing  
separately.  

Should you file a joint return? Here  
are some things to keep in mind:  
- On a joint return, each spouse is  
responsible for any tax due; if  
additional tax is due on the  
original return, or as a result of  
an audit, YOU could end up paying  
it, even though you had clearly  
paid enough tax to cover your  
separate income. If there is any  
problem with your husband's tax  
information (fraud, unreported  
income) consider filing separately.  
- Be sure to get your share of any  
refund due, AND a portion of the  
tax saved by filing jointly. Cal-  
culate the tax on each spouse's  
income and deductions separately,  
and then jointly. Come to an  
agreement before signing the  
return. If you are in the pro-  
cess of a divorce or legal separ-  
ation, your attorney should be  
consulted.
