Recognized the rights of all women  
to have the information and the  
means to control their fertility.  
For its fundamental position that  
women have the right to choose  
when or whether to bear children,  
Planned Parenthood has been sub-  
jected to abuse and harassment  
which epitomizes the basest pre-  
judice all women experience in  
this society. Planned Parenthood  
has weathered thousands of dollars  
in funding cuts and has responded  
by generating new sources of pri-  
vate support to continue to pro-  
vide both educational and medical  
services to women of all ages,  
races and economic needs.  

ELIZABETH HOLTZMAN  

The keynote speaker for the  
Women-Helping-Women Awards Dinner  
was Elizabeth Holtzman, District  
Attorney of King's County in  
Brooklyn, N.Y. She was elected  
in 1981 as the first woman Dis-  
trict Attorney in New York City  
and the second in the history of  
the State of New York.  

Prior to becoming DA, Holtzman  
served in the U.S. House of Repre-  
sentatives from 1973-1981. During  
her distinguished career in Con-  
gress, Holtzman served on the  
House Judiciary Committee during  
the impeachment hearings on  
Richard Nixon. She was the first  
Democratic woman to serve on the  
House Budget Committee. Holtzman  
won international acclaim for her  
work against Nazi war criminals  
living in America. She was the  
first member of Congress to expose  
government inaction against sus-  
pected war criminals and wrote the  
law which authorizes their deporta-  
tion from our country.

PLANNED PARENTHOOD  

Holtzman has been an outspoken  
advocate on women's issues. While  
in Congress, she authored laws  
that protect the privacy of rape  
victims and make child pornography  
a federal crime. During her term  
as District Attorney, she has led  
successful campaigns to amend  
New York State laws to remove  
obstacles to the prosecution of  
rapists and child molesters, and  
has implemented various measures  
to help crime victims.  

Holtzman was graduated from  
Radcliffe College, magna cum laude,  
and received her law degree from  
Harvard Law School. She has been  
honored by numerous groups includ-  
ing the New Jersey and Los Angeles  
American Civil Liberties Union,  
the National Council of Jewish  
Women and the Young Women's Chris-  
tian Association.  

Dear Common Ground:  

The Coalition for Equal Rights is  
a network of organizations from the  
Buffalo Metropolitan area who are  
working together for passage of the  
Equal Rights Amendment and other e-  
quity issues. A grassroots outgrowth  
of the National Women's Conference  
Committee's "A New Day: Beyond ERA"  
campaign, we are non-partisan and do  
not endorse candidates. Our intent  
is not to become another women's  
organization, but rather to serve  
as a network of organizations which  
are committed to the attainment of  
equity for women. To that end, we  
meet to share ideas, plan joint ac-  
tivities, serve as mutual resources,  
and coordinate efforts in behalf of  
equity issues.  

Since the founding of the Coali-  
tion in 1982, our efforts on behalf  
of the ERA have included polling can-  
didates on their positions on the  
ERA, providing information to the  
public on candidates’ positions on  
equity issues, lobbying our elected  
representatives in support of the  
ERA, and serving as a resource to  
organizations, public officials and  
the community on the legal implica-  
tions of the ERA.  

In addition to efforts in support  
of the state and federal ERA, we  
have advocated for other equity is-  
sues. We have worked with Erie County  
Legislators on behalf of the estab-  
lishment of a commission on the sta-  
tus of women. This has resulted in  
the creation of the Status of Women  
Task Force which has been chartered  
for one year. We testified at the  
New York Department of State's hear-  
ings on the feminization of poverty.  

We urge your participation in the  
Coalition; we would like our coali-  
tion to be as broad-based as possible  
and thoroughly representative of the  
community. Organizations are asked  
to contribute a minimum of $10-25,  
depending on size and resources.  

Meeting places and dates are  
staggered in order to accommodate  
the greatest number of organiza-  
tions. We welcome representa-  
tives of your organization.  

If you have questions or agenda  
items, please call me at 835-6271.  
We need your help and look forward  
to your participation.  

Sincerely,  
Karen Stephenson  
Co-ordinator
