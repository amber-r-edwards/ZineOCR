In CG’s July issue, we plan a  
special section on Summer Reading  
that subscribers can look forward  
to. We regularly receive woman-  
oriented books from a number of  
small presses, and CG would like to  
recruit a small cadre of women to  
write regular reviews, contact pub-  
lishers about new releases, and  
perhaps organize an annual issue  
centered around book reviews.  

Please write or call us if you are  
interested in participating - we  
are planning an "interested in CG?"  
potential new member/friend meeting  
this summer where this, among other  
topics, could be discussed.  

The September issue theme will be  
“Women and Children." Material for  
this issue should be received by  
August 1st. We are looking for pho-  
tos (B & W), artwork, short fiction  
pieces, and non-fiction pieces that  
will deal with a wide range of issues.  
Some suggested topics: Teenagers on  
Mothers; Grandparenting; Finding  
Quality Daycare; Choosing to be a  
Mother who Does Not Work Outside the  
Home; Lesbian Mothers; Raising Chil-  
dren Without Sex Bias; and many other  
potential topics!  

Common Ground wishes to offer a  
special thank you to the women of the  
former Nyu Li Tao Self-Defense Collec-  
tive (recently disbanded) who voted  
to divide their remaining treasury  
between CG and EMMA. The contribution  
was needed and very much appreciated.  

Don't forget to keep saving your  
cash register tapes from any area  
Bells, Tops and Super-Duper Stores.  
Mail them to us at P.O. Box 313, Bid-  
well Station, Buffalo, N.Y. 14213.  

It is hard to remember to thank every  
individual who has sent us tapes, but  
among others, a special thank you to  
Paulette Hammond, Jacki Lonski, Susan  
Doty and the congregation of Metro-  
politan Community Church. Drop-off  
boxes for tapes are available at the  
following stores:  

*EMMA, 168 Elmwood Avenue

POLICY  

PHILOSOPHY - Common Ground is potentially, with  
help from Western New York women, a forum to  
celebrate the rich diversity of our community. We view  
the paper as a ribbon that may connect our com-  
monalities, our intersection points. We are inviting you  
to participate actively in the building of a support system  
for WNY women. We affirm our commitment to enhance  
the lives of women on physical, educational, spiritual,  
psychological, social and economic levels. We want to  
present, fair-mindedly, the issues that concern women,  
and information of value to women. We offer Common  
Ground as a place where women can display their art  
and personal literature, and review the tapestries of their  
experiences.  

EDITORIAL POLICY - Common Ground is especially  
looking for articles which address the needs and interests  
of local women.  

1. Common Ground is a publication of news, culture  
and dialogue from women’s perspectives.  

2. News, Opinion, Analysis and Commentary will  
each be clearly labeled as such.  

3. We are seeking to provide accurate, straightforward  
information of value to women.  

4. The collective will not intentionally print or sup-  
port materials or viewpoints which will harm women  
because of color, sexuality, religious or ethnic  
background, physical disability or economic situation.  

5. While opinions expressed in Common Ground are  
those of the authors and not necessarily those of the col-  
lective as a whole, we do accept responsibility for choos-  
ing what we print.  

SUBMISSIONS — We welcome articles, letters, infor-  
mation and announcements of interest to women.  
Graphics, cartoons, art and photography will be grateful-  
ly received. We especially invite women who do not  
usually have access to traditional media - women of col-  
or, differently abled, economically or educationally  
disadvantaged, and those for whom English is a second  
language - to write. Suggested length of letters: 250  
words. Letters must be signed to be printed. We will,  
however, respect your privacy and withhold your name  
if you request. Suggested length of articles, commentary,  
analysis: 500-750 words. Please type and double space  
your work, 40 characters across. If you do not have ac-  
cess to a typewriter, please print clearly. In time we hope  
to have a typewriter, paper, etc., available for those who  
request it. Include a stamped, self-addressed envelope  
and work and home phone numbers. Because we want  
to hear your voices, if your piece needs to be edited for  
length or clarity, we will call you/ask you to do it. Keep  
copies of your work. We will try to notify you within  
three (3) weeks if we intend to use your work. If we print  
it, we will give you five (5) copies of the issue in which  
it appears. Artwork should be black and white copies  
only, and title/describe your work. We will copyright the  
entire issue, but the copyright on each piece reverts to  
the author/artist, that she may decide where her work  
is printed. Please request a style sheet for further infor-  
mation and guidelines if you want to write.
