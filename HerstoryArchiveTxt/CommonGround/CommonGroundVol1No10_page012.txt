A Handbook for Women in Abusive Relationships

Getting Free: A Handbook for Women

in Abusive Relationships by Ginny
NiCarthy, 1982, The Seal Press

By EMMA Bookstore Collective

For women in abusive relationships,
making the decision to leave is a
long, painful process. Although help
in the form of shelters, advocacy and
short-term counseling may be available
during a period of crisis or once
she has made a firm decision to leave,
the decision itself is often made in
isolation. Until now, the many books
and articles dealing with woman-
battering have been more descriptive
or theoretical than practical, offer-
ing little to the woman who is trying
to decide how to best protect herself
from abuse.

In Getting Free, Ginny NiCarthy,
founder and director of Abused Women's
Network in Seattle, WA., has written
a practical, self-help guide for wo-
men trying to re-establish control
over their own lives. As Del Martin
observes in her introduction to the
book, "Getting Free addresses every
woman who ever had any doubts about
herself and her mission in life.
NiCarthy confirms what most of us
in the battered women's movement
have learned: That the battered
woman is no different than the rest
of us, that the plight of the bat-
tered woman magnifies what most women
have experienced at some point in
their lives.”

The first part of the book deals
with making the decision to leave
or stay in the relationship. Unlike
many writers, who can't imagine why
a woman would choose to stay in an
abusive relationship, NiCarthy is
sensitive to the many conflicting
messages women hear from friends,
family, church, the media and the
abuser himself.

Rather than simply telling the woman
to leave, she offers values clarifi-
cation exercises [which are designed
to help an individual sort out her
own values and real feelings], to
help women make their own decision.
These exercises address such issues
as advantages and disadvantages of
married and single life, personal
rights, loving the abuser, fears and
risks, advantages and disadvantages
of leaving and staying.

In the following section, NiCarthy
deals with Getting Professional Help,
including realistic information
about the biases and lack of concrete
help women are likely to encounter
from police, doctors and the legal
profession and counselors.

The third section, Helping Your-
self to Survival, stresses practical
steps women can take to be their
own counselors, take positive action
in their own behalf, and reach out
to others.

Section IV, After You Leave,
deals with handling the emotional
and practical problems that result
from leaving the abuser--including
the first week, welfare and housing,
economic issues, sexuality and new
relationships, and dealing with
loneliness.

The final section, The Ones Who
Got Away, consists of interviews with
nine formerly abused women. Throughout,
NiCarthy avoids a moralistic
approach and instead offers practi-
cal questions and activities to
help women figure out what they
want to do.

Getting Free is a timely book.

In an era of Reagonomics and con-
servative backlash, battered women's
shelters, at best only a temporary
solution for abused women, are facing
cut-backs, while at the same time
family violence is increasing.
Counseling and other professional
support is expensive, inaccessible and
often biased. For many women, a

book that offers practical suggestions
and sensitivity to the conflicting
pressures they face can truly be a
lifesaver. ©
