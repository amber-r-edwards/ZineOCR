MISSION STATEMENT

AT THE FOOT OF THE MOUNTAIN is a professional women’s theater of protest, celebration, and hope; our mission is to participate in the generation of a just and joyous world by creating theater and related arts programs which are informed by the following Political and Artistic

Statements:

POLITICAL STATEMENT

RADICAL—from the Latin word “radix,” meaning “root.”  
POLITICAL—from the Greek word “polis,” meaning “city.” Anything that affects the relationships and quality of life among people in a community is “political.” Art can reinforce the values in a community or it can challenge them; in either case, ALL ART IS POLITICAL.

AT THE FOOT OF THE MOUNTAIN charges all participants in the theater’s activities:

© to see, with radical vision, the roots of all issues;  
® to create, from those roots, alternative analyses, solutions, visions;  
@ to honor the artist’s political responsibility to be of service;  
@ to revolt against misogyny and all related violations of the human spirit whereby one person (or group of persons) has power over another;  
@ to renew hope and celebrate the healing power of women;  
@ to remember that the ends never justify the means, for the means always determine the ends;  
® to maintain personal, political, artistic, and financial integrity;  
® to allow these political values to inform all artistic, educational, and management activities.

TICKET PRICES

THE SLIDING SCALE: WHAT IS IT AND WHY DO WE USE IT?

The primary reason we use the sliding scale is so we never have to turn anyone away for lack of money. We set the lower end of the scale at $4.00 because that’s what a first-run movie costs in Minneapolis; we notice that many people with limited incomes are willing to pay movie theaters, so $4.00 is our minimum price for a first-run live theater event. (There are always exceptions; we never turn anyone away, no matter what.) If we priced all our tickets at $4.00, however, we'd go broke, so we decided to take responsibility to redistribute available money and, following the examples of other women’s organizations and some “social service” organizations, we created a sliding scale which ranges from $4.00 to $10.00. The scale works on the honor system (we don’t ask to see tax returns or W-4 forms); the sign outside the box office says, “Pay the appropriate price and reap the rewards of an honest heart.”

IF YOUR GROSS ANNUAL INCOME IS: YOUR TICKET COSTS:

$40,000 - $75,000 $10.00  
$31,000 - $40,000 $ 9.00  
$24,000 - $31,000 $ 8.00  
$17,000 - $24,000 $ 7.00  
$10,000 - $17,000 $ 6.00  
$4,000 - $10,000 $ 5.00  
$0 - $4,000 $ 4.00  

The scale is somewhat arbitrary (we don’t have scientific data to justify the income ranges), but it feels fair. Essentially, we ask individuals with more income to subsidize those with less; the sliding scale means we can serve audiences with a wide range of economic means and not martyr ourselves in the process.

For the past year, the average ticket price hovered around $5.75. With inflation pushing phone bills, rent, and food up, up, and up, we’ve talked about raising the bottom line to $5.00. But, like our own (we make $150/week when the funds are available), we know many people’s incomes are fixed (if not decreasing). So we’re staying with $4.00 at the bottom, but we're adding a new range to the top. BECAUSE: when we were creating ASHES, ASHES, WE ALL FALL DOWN, we learned that over 30 local corporations held contracts of over $1,000,000/year/each with the Pentagon. Honeywell, the local business that made the anti-personnel fragmentation bombs used in Vietnam in the Sixties and is making them now for the Middle East, has over $1 billion in “defense” contracts. The Chief Executive Officer of this information, our additional sliding scale looks like this:

IF YOUR GROSS ANNUAL INCOME IS: YOUR TICKET COSTS:

$75,000 - $200,000 $ 25.00  
$200,000 - $400,000 $ 50.00  
$400,000 and above $100.00  

We've yet to sell a ticket over $10.00, but we will. Meanwhile, the added scale makes $10.00 ticket buyers less out of place and everybody gets to chuckle (or cry or get very angry) that there really are people who make that kind of money building weapons of destruction while others of us struggle to stop the war on the poor, to pay utility bills for power lines we don’t want, to pay rents we can’t afford, to keep the kids clothed and fed and schooled.

That’s why we use the sliding scale. After the initial embarrassment about revealing anything in public about money has worn off, most of our audience members endorse the scale. The procedure is simple: ticket prices are posted next to the box office door, the person at the box office asks ticket buyers to look at the scale and tell her how much their tickets cost. That done, the most difficult part of the procedure is keeping accurate records for our auditor.

Thanks to your continuing contributions (and to our own resilience in surviving creative lay-offs), we once again finished our fiscal year “in the black.”

We're now back on full-time salaries and, because of ritual work and projects like UNK/E! and ASHES, ASHES, WE ALL FALL DOWN, we're more involved in community activities than ever before. We’re also, as you'll gather from reading about other activities described in this Newsletter, fertile with new projects and ideas.

The financial world, however, is not so fertile (nor can it be as long as budget allocations prioritize weapons and death over service and life). With grants becoming a less reliable source of support, we—you and us—must strengthen the ecology of our theater lives together if we are to continue our relationship as artists/cultural workers and audience/community. You rely on the women At the Foot of the Mountain to create high-quality theater which outrages the status quo and brings joy/hope to the living; we rely on you to help create a stable economic base so we can do our work sanely and well.

You can help by contributing time or money, and you can contribute either by filling out the Contribution Form printed below. We know it would be easier for you to send us this form if we had enclosed a self-addressed envelope. BUT, because we’d already “stuffed” the Summer ’83 Workshop brochure inside this Newsletter (and because we didn’t have the ready cash to invest in printed envelopes), there are none.

So, please fill out the form below and return it to us in your own envelope. Thanks. If your time and your financial resources are limited right now, save up. We'll send you several timely reminders this year of our need for your imaginative and continuing support.

*Our Fiscal Year begins July 1 and ends June 30; study the accompanying financial figures for FYs ’80-83. They’re interesting.
