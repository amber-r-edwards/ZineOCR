SPEAKING WITH CONFIDENCE:
Speech Communication for Women

“One of the first things children and women are taught
to do is to hold their tongues.” Clare Booth Luce

Given our culture, it is not surprising that most women
tend to speak in a more deferential, uncertain manner
than men. In a patriarchy where they are taught to be
submissive, women learn the “proper” way to speak—
which is unduly restrictive. This class will explore the
roots of our acquired speech behavior as well as offer
practical exercises in learning how to communicate
own speech inhibitions as well as practice positive
speech skills. This course is designed for any woman
who is apprehensive about speaking in front of groups
as well as any woman wanting to learn how to speak
with confidence and clarity.

CLASSES FOR WOMEN

BEGINNING ACTING: An Introduction to the
Acting Approach At the Foot of the Mountain

The body is part of the actor’s instrument. More than a
resonating chamber and a shapemaker, the actor is an
embodied soul. Awareness and training of the emotional
life is as important as physical training—perhaps
even more so—as it produces greater understanding as
well as flexibility of the tool. In the beginning course,
we will explore the choices an actor makes; we will
begin to discover and make use of our physical, vocal,
emotional, and spiritual tools; we will initiate our
powers of observation and understanding; we will
welcome ourselves as expressive beings. We will achieve
all of this through exercises, games, and discussion.

Two sessions of this class will be offered:

BASIC CARPENTRY FOR WOMEN (for the truly inexperienced)

Never be intimidated by a curved-claw hammer or
Phillips head screw again! This course will laugh in the
face of theory and rely on practical application of basic
hand tools (some power tools) and measuring devices.

VOICE AND MOVEMENT IMPROVISATION FOR WOMEN

This class will use the Action Theater Form developed
by Ruth Zaporah, in which vocal and physical exercises
are always grounded in immediate emotions and
sensations. As Zaporah says, “Action Theater reunites
the mover and the performer so that the voice, the
body, and the mind are a single projecting entity.”
The class is for dancers, actors, singers, and every woman
interested in improvisation.

CLASSES FOR CHILDREN

CREATIVE DRAMATICS FOR CHILDREN (Ages 5-7)

This class is structured for children ages 5 through 7.
Through theater games and exercises, the child sees
the actor as worker, as a portrayer of human emotions.
Exercises are simple and teach the child coordination.
Games are fun and allow the child to be creative. The
class is taught with a deep regard for non-sexist, non-
racist, and non-elitist principles and allows both sexes
of this age group to explore the world of theater in an
imaginative and child-like way.

INSTRUCTOR: Robyn Sue Schmidt

DATES: Saturdays, October 30-December 11
(no class November 27)

TIME: 11 a.m.-Noon

COST: $20.00

CREATIVE DRAMATICS FOR CHILDREN (Ages 8-12)

For children ages 8 through 12, this class teaches the
basic skills that actors use in their work but which also
enhance other work forms: concentration, physical
flexibility, and vocal creativity. Using theater games and
exercises, the child is encouraged to explore the world
of theater and use the imagination to try new ideas
that need expression. The class is taught with a deep
regard for non-sexist, non-racist, and non-elitist principles
and allows both sexes of this age group to imagine
and create while strengthening their sense of self and
giving them some first-hand knowledge about acting.

INSTRUCTOR: Robyn Sue Schmidt

DATES: Saturdays, October 30-December 11
(no class November 27)

TIME: 9:00-11:00 a.m.

COST: $30.00
