The United States fought World  
War II to destroy Nazism. We de-  
feated Germany and as spoils of  
victory, we have incorporated  
their methods in South East Asia.  
We are told that the U.S. is in  
this war to preserve South Viet-  
namese independence. Yet South  
Vietnamese women lead an exist-  
ence comparable, at the very  
least, to Nazi occupation. The  
time has come for women in this  
country to unite around the  
oppression suffered by our South  
Vietnamese sisters at the hands  
of the U.S. government and its  
armed forces.  

Vietnamization -  

Pacification Program  

All South Vietnamese men from 16-  
60 years of age are required to  
serve in the army. Therefore,  
women are left not only with  
raising the families, taking  
care of the aged, but also with  
the problem of materially sup-  
porting the villagers. U.S.  
military strategy assumes that  
all South Vietnamese living in  
the north of Saigon are "poten-  
tial enemies." This underlies  
our so-called Vietnamization  
program. It involves the re-  
locating of millions of people  
south of Saigon. Unprecedented  
air bombardment and "search  
and destroy" missions are the  
humanitarian features of this  
strategy. U.S. forces go into  
a rural village, line all the  
people up, beat, torture, rape  
them, then level the village  

to the ground. All means of  
livelihood, such as livestock,  
are slaughtered or burned.  

The villagers are then sent to  
relocation centers south of  
Saigon (a large majority being  
women). These are nothing more  
than concentration camps. Sur-  
rounded by barbed wire, the in-  
mates are guarded with machine  
guns, fed meagerly if at all;  
sanitation and health facilities  
are noticeably absent. The U.S.  
pacification program places  
millions of women in concentra-  
tion camps. Nixon has told us  
that this program is successful  
and proceeding on schedule.  

Prostitution  

The main social activities of  
Americans in Viet Nam are "getting  
drunk, stoned and laid a lot."  

Prostitution has become a sophis-  
ticated business. Caravans of  
women are taken by pimps (who re-  
ceive most of the money) to mili-  
tary camps. There are an esti-  
mated 400,000 prostitutes in  

Saigon alone. These women sell  
themselves, not out of choice,  

but necessity. It is their only  
means of survival, of feeding their

families, and this very often  
proves fatal. Prostitutes, often  
not paid, are abused incredibly  
and in many cases murdered.  

VD is so rampant that the U.S.  
government provides Penicillin to  
all military upon arrival in Viet  
Nam. This concern with the health  
of its fighting forces appears  
grotesque in comparison to the  
U.S. government's concern with the  
health of the South Vietnamese  
people.  

Atrocities  

The following is the testimony of  
Bill Conway, a GI stationed in Viet  
Nam, from May 1966 to November 1966.  
He relates what was done to three  
NLF nurses who were captured by  
seven GIs.  

First they took one girl, two guys  
held their weapons on two of the  
girls so that they couldn't move.  
The other five guys took the other  
girl and threw her on a mat. Two  
pinned her arms back and two held  
her legs apart. The other guy  
raped her. The girl screamed.  

The guys hit her and told her to  
shut up. The girl kept saying,  
"Chieu-hoi," meaning that they  

just wanted to surrender. Each  

of the five raped the girl. Then  
the other two raped her while two  
of the others held weapons on the  
two other girls. Each girl was  
raped many times. They were scream-  
ing and crying the whole time. When  
they finished raping them, three of  
the GIs took hand flares and shoved  
them in the girls' vaginas. The  
girls were unconscious at that point.  
No one had to hold them down any  
longer. The girls were bleeding  
from their mouths, noses, face and  
vaginas. Then they struck the ex-  
terior portion of the flares and  
they exploded inside the girls.  
Their stomachs started bloating  

up and then they exploded. The  
stomachs exploded and their in-  

testines were just hanging out of  
their bodies.  

Such atrocities occur daily. They  
are directed not only at "enemy"  
women but also at the South Viet-  
namese who we are supposedly pro-  
tecting. Methods of torture used  
always involve women's sexual organs,  
such as sticking a burning bayonet  
up a vagina or applying electric  
shock to the nipples. It has been  
stated that "war is hell," our men  
cannot be held responsible for what  
they do in "kill or be killed"  
circumstances. This is BULLSHIT.  
Americans are taught racism from  

the day they are born and American  
men are conditioned thoroughly in  
sexism. Armed forces training fully  
accelerates racism and sexism.  

Soldiers are trained in bizarre  
sexual tortures. They are inundated  
with "gookism." Killing Vietnamese  
has become little more than target  
practice. Old men and young child-  
ren are slaughtered, tortured and  
beaten under the guise of stopping  
Communist aggression. Gook women  
serve a more prescribed function.  
American boys are told and even  
encouraged to rape any Vietnamese  
women without fear of punishment.  
Many U.S. soldiers have testified  
about going into a village, kid-  
napping a woman back to the jungle,  
having a gang-bang and then  
killing the girl if they so desire.  
As one GI put it: "not that the  
Vietnamese girls could, you know,  
resist very much because a GI could  
be pretty nasty. After all, he  

has got the weapon, not them."  

WHO IS THE REAL ENEMY?  

Since 1965 the U.S. government  

has maintained a massive army  

and bombing program in South Viet  
Nam. Lieutenant Calley has been  
sentenced to a life of hard labor.  
That he is a war criminal there is  
no doubt and so is every American  
soldier in Viet Nam. But what is  
more important and must be clearly  
understood is that the U.S. govern-  
ment has developed and maintained  
a policy of war crimes since 1965.  
Playing on the racism and sexism  
of its soldiers, this government  
has turned them into a force which  
is bent on the total destruction  
of Viet Nam and its people. This  
is the only hope this government  
has for victory. The South Viet-  
namese realize who their real  
enemy is. It is NOT the North  
Vietnamese who are putting the  
South Vietnamese in concentra-  
tion camps, forcing the women to  
prostitute themselves, raping and  
slaughtering them, burning their  
villages -- The United States  

is doing this and is the real  
enemy.  

We must take every opportunity  
available to demonstrate our  

solidarity with our Vietnamese  
sisters and our opposition to  
their oppressors.
