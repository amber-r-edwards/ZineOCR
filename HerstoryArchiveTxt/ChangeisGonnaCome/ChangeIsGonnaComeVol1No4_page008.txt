Were All in the Same  
Bus Together  

Have you ever seen your boss riding  
the bus home? Of course not. The  
idea seems as absurd as seeing him  
walk into the office carrying a  
lunchpail.  

Yet every day, thousands of us be-  

gin and end each weekday being packed,  
shoved and prodded into the cattle-  
cars that pass for public transpor-  
tation in San Francisco.  

After another trying day in the of-  
fice, there's nothing quite like  
the long haul home to bring down  
that final blow to our surviving  
self-respect.  

Shoe-horned into the already bulg-  

ing buses, we are threatened and  
coerced into packing ourselves  
even tighter to make room for the  
masses waiting at the next stop.  
(One driver on our route does a  
special bit where he refuses to  
budge until every square inch of  
space in the back has been filled.)  

No sooner have we made it in, than  
it's time to plan a strategy for  
getting out. By the time we have  
fought our way across an obstacle  
of arms, legs, purses, packages  
and sore toes, we're lucky if we  
are still in a three-block range  
of the stop we were aiming for.  

We get off, hating that ugly,  
stupid, clumsy cargo from which  

we have just extricated ourselves,  
hating the bus driver for bullying  
us, hating ourselves for submit-  
ting to all these indignities.  

Then we go home, hoping to forget  

it all, to unwind over a beer, to  
block it out 'till it comes up the  
next day, and the next, and the next.  

Pretty frustrating, especially  
when it comes to looking for  
some explanation for this daily  
dehumanizing experience.  

At first, the culprits seem  
obvious -- if the men (either  
our immediate bosses or their  
bosses) who wield economic and  
political power in San Francisco  
were forced to use public trans-  
portation for one month, we might  

see the whole public transportation  
system modernized. But that is,  
after all, a pipe-dream.  

The problem is too deeply rooted  

in our urban culture to be solved  
so simply.  

When the paperwork becomes more  
important than the office workers,  
when the "system" operates only  
for a few, and the bureaucratic  
structure operates only for pro-  
fit, the "human element" disappears  
in all our "public" activities.  
Public transportation is a perfect  
example of this dehumanization.  

Though the consolation is small  
that we all suffer together,  

passengers and bus drivers alike,  
perhaps by relating to each other  
as humanly as possible during  

the commuting hours, we may find  
new directions for this frustra-  
tion.  

Eight hours a day in an office  

and one hour a day on a bus, can  
make us hateful and angry -- but  

it is up to us to direct that anger  
away from our fellow victims and  
towards "the man" -- whether he's  
the one that pays your salary or  
spends your taxes.  

And That  
Ain’t Gossip  

NEW YORK - An Ohio radio station  
refused to hire a woman who want-  
ed to be a newscaster...  

When she complained to the mana-  
ger, he told her he didn't hire  
female newscasters because "news  
coming from a woman sounds like  
gossip.”  

WASHINGTON D.C. - The average in-  
come of families headed by women  
is less than half of the income  
of families headed by men, the  
Department of Labor has reported.  
One out of ten American families  
has a woman as chief breadwinner;  
nearly 2 million of these 5 1/2  
million families have incomes be-  
low poverty level.  

The  
oppressed  
majority —  
speaks  

its mind  

From the politics of housework to the  
politics of orgasm—every aspect  

of the struggle for equality between  
the sexes is covered in these  
impassioned articles by black women,  
high school women, ex-New Leftists,  
housewives and seasoned feminists.

RANDOM HOUSE  

Whose peers?  

The trial of Paul Rose, charged  
with the kidnapping and execution  
of Quebec Labor Minister Pierre  
Laporte last fall, has produced  
another dramatic political ex-  
plosion.  

Because Quebec law forbids women  
to sit on juries, Lise Balser, a  
witness in the trial, has refused  
to testify... On March 1st, seven  
women forced their way into the  
jurors’ box and demanded that  
they be allowed to sit there.  

The women explained that since the  
law says that everyone has the  
right to be tried by a jury of  
his or her peers, if a woman can't  
sit on the jury then the state cannot  
try women. The women were sentenced  
to one to two months for contempt  
of court.  

If you don’t,  
who will?
