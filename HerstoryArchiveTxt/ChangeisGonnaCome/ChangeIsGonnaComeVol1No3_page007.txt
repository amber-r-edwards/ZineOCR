SMALL GROUP ORIENTATIONS (continuous) at  
WOMEN’S CENTER, 1380 Howard, first Monday  
and Third Thursday of every month, 7:30 PM. For  
women new to the movement, Living in a male-dominated  
world, we are constantly alienated from our  
real selves, taught to doubt and suppress our gut  
reactions in favor of the male view of things. In small  
conscious-raising groups we learn that what we  
thought were our personal idiosyncrasies and hang-ups,  
are in reality shared by most other women and  
that we are entirely normal. This leads to newfound  
strength and a re-affirmation of the validity of our  
OWN ideas and feelings. Come to a meeting and find  
out just how many of your “personal problems” are  

really the social problems of a sexist society.

WOMEN’S PARTY, Women’s Center, 1380 Howard,  
7-10 PM, every other Sunday. Next one is March 14,
