The Natural Look

Here's how to achieve that natural
look in make-up: Wake up in the
morning; look out the window,
breathe deeply; don't put on any
make-up. That's all there is to
it!

At first you feel vulnerable,
exposed and pale. You might even
run back and put all that goop
back on. But as time goes on,

as you get used to looking natural,
you find you have more time and
energy for other activities.

You are not spending hours
“putting on your face" or

washing it off. You find you

are not looking in the mirror

as much, since there is nothing
to check up on. Your real face
will remain the same, unlike

your old mask, which could rub
away at any time. Your face is
simply a mirror of your real
self, not the result of some
advertising agency's successful
campaign, not a fantasy of Revlon
or Clairol or some other male-
controlled cosmetic firm.

Blinding Beauty

In the 1930's, coal tar from Lash
Lure eye make-up was found to
cause permanent blindness. The
public was shocked, so in 1936 it
became illegal for coal tar to be
used in "make-up that is used
around the eyes." Due to lobby-
ing, the law was amended to allow
it to be used in other make-up
and hair dye, with a warning
label. Coal tar causes cancer
on the skin of animals.

In 1961, after several complaints
of severe eye irritations, the
government tested the eyeliners
on the market. Practically every
brand tested, including Revlon,
Elizabeth Arden, Maybelline, Avon,
Hazel Bishop, Max Factor, and
Helena Rubinstein, was found to
have coal tar color--illegal for
use around the eye since 1938.

just a detail...?

Makeup doesn't make a woman any
more than clothes make a man.
Makeup is merely a toy which
manufacturers have been pushing
down our throats for years via
t.v. commercials and ads which
skillfully convince us that this
miracle called makeup is the
only way to ensure our success,
love and acceptance in this
society.

We have been fed such powerful
propaganda so frequently and
through every media available

that more often than not a woman
wouldn't be caught dead leaving
her home without her "face" on.

I remember talking with a woman
who bragged that after 26 years

of marriage, her husband had never

“seen her without her "face"...

makeup.

Is it a detail in our lives or is
it our lives? Before you feed
the make-up manufacturer another
dime, ask yourself just one ques-
tion... If you had to choose
only three personal articles to
take to a desert island with you
would you bring the eyeliner?
