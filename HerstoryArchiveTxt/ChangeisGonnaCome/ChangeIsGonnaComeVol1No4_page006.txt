Suing Bank of America

KATIE: The idea is, sooner or  
later you'll get married and  
have babies.

KERSTIN: So I got more and  
more frustrated, and then Katie  
told me about this suit, so I  
said, why not?

KATIE: It's really an exciting  
thing going through with this  
case, I've always said, "The  
best way to change things is  
by working from within.” It  
had been an empty statement,  
but now I can really do it...  
use legal means to bring about  
change. It was a pretty scary  
step. I'm sole support of my  
husband and me right now, and  
it would be a heavy thing for  
me to lose my job.

KERSTIN: We're all in the same  
boat. It would be terrible for  
any of us to lose our jobs. The  

three of us just came to a point  
where it was more important that  
we do this than hold our jobs.  
It took a long time to take this  
step.

CHANGE: You mean this is on  
your record forever?

KATIE: Yes, we're blackballed  
as rabble-rousers, rebellious,  
and there's no way I could get  

a job with another bank now.  
What kind of a recommendation  
would they give me? "Well, she  

The Bank

worked with us for a year and a  
half, and then brought a sex  
discrimination suit." "Whoopee!  
We really want her on our staff,”  
It's really hard to have to do  
this to get any action. But we  
brought this to their eyes hun-  
dreds of times and they've  
turned away; as if to say, go to  
your room, don't worry your head  
about it. It's just the most  
distasteful thing in the world  
that we have to come to a law-  
suit to force them to do this  
and it's going to leave a bad  
taste in everyone's mouth.  
KERSTIN: But the only way they'll  
listen to you is if you fight  
on their terms; otherwise, they  
ignore you.

CHANGE: What means are you us-  
ing to press this action?

KATIE: There are two separate  
actions going on concurrently.  
One is a complaint lodged with  
the EEOC (Equal Employment Op-  
portunity Commission). The  
other is a private class-ac-  
tion lawsuit. The lawsuit  
covers potentially 25,000  
employees, the total number  

April 1971

of women employed by the Bank  
of America. The EEOC investi-  
gation covers only 500 em-  
ployees--men and women--in  

the International Division,  
where the three of us work. The  
two actions could go on si-  
multaneously, since they have  
different jurisdictions. But we  
are holding our private suit  

in abeyance until the findings  
of the EEOC investigation are  
complete. This will be some  
time this month.

KERSTIN: The trouble is that  
the government agencies have  
no enforcement power. They can  
only investigate and make  
recommendations to the bank.  
KATIE: But our private suit  
has driven the bank into the  
arms of the EEOC, given the EEOC  
some teeth. Because for the  
bank, the government investi-  
gation is much the lesser of  
the two evils. So they really  
want to cooperate, rather than  
see us go on with the private  
suit. If the agency were the  
only threat, the bank would be  
very uncooperative. This way,  
the only alternative is a law-  
suit, and the bank knows it.  
They know we are perfectly pre-  
pared. We have our attorneys  
and are ready to go to court  
tomorrow.

CHANGE: If women in other  
companies want to follow your  
example, where can they go  

for help?

KATIE: The two women to con-  
tact are B. J. Miller at FEPC  
(Fair Employment Practice Com-  
mission), a state agency, and  
Brenda Brush at EEOC, the fed-  
eral agency we are working  
through. B. J. Miller will be  
able to give you information  
on all the different ways you  
can go about doing these things.  
KERSTIN: Our attorney's name,  
by the way, is Barbara Phil-  
lips, of Patrick, Buchanan and  
Phillips. She would like women  
to come forward--in all indus-  
tries, but especially at the  
Bank of America--to discuss their  
own cases with her. She'd like  
more women to get involved in  
this.

CHANGE: What was the reaction  
among other women when your  
suit became public?

KATIE: Surprisingly, some of  
the young women are violently  
against us. We try to tell  
them what we're doing and they  
answer we're upsetting the estab-  

(cont’d from page 1)

lishment. But what more estab-  
lishment thing could I do than  
sue for my equal rights under  
the Constitution of the United  
States? It's my equal rights  
under the law. The bank is in  
the wrong, the bank is breaking  
the law--not me!

And there's another thing I want  
to say. People don't understand  
that what we're saying isn't  
that every woman is going to be  
a good banker. All we're saying  
is: Give us a chance; if we  
fail, we fail because we don't  
have the ability, not because  
we're female. Nobody's given us  
a chance!  
KERSTIN: And I think the bank  
will benefit from this too, just  
as much as the women. They'll  
find they have a lot of loyal,  
intelligent women who will do  
a great job for them.  
CHANGE: Would you suggest that  
other women pursue your course?  
KATIE: Definitely.  
KATIE: And in all different  
industries--airlines, teaching,  
advertising, manufacturing.  
KERSTIN: It's a subtle discrimi-  
nation, it's a hard thing to  
fight.  
KATIE: Banking is a particu-  
larly difficult field to inte-  
grate, because it is so tra-  
ditionally a male-dominated  
area.  
KERSTIN: It's necessary that  
more and more women go into  
the traditionally male fields,  
because then people will have  
to turn to their services, and  
sooner or later they will start  
accepting them, discovering that  
women are just as competent and  
trustworthy as men.
