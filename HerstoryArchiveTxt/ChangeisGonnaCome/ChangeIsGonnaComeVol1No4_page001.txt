Women Sue

Recently, CHANGE interviewed
three young women about their
soon-to-be-famous sex discri-
mination suit against Bank of
America. In the following con-
versation, Kerstin Fraser, Bar-
bara Sowers and Kathleen Wells
talk about events leading up to
the suit and why they would urge
other women to do the same.

CHANGE: What discrimination led
you to press this suit?

KATIE: When men are hired by
the bank, they immediately go
into a training program which
lasts six months; when the women
are hired, they go immediately
onto the job. When the men come
off the training program, they
are given the title of Assist-
ant Cashier. A woman, if she's
lucky, gets the title of Pro-
Assistant Cashier--and usually
it takes a year to get even that.
Very rarely can she advance to
an Assistant title, and then
usually only after 10-15 years.

A man starts out at a salary
anywhere from $100 to $200 more
a month, with the same qualifi-
cations as the woman. Now I've
been here a year and a half. The
men coming off the training pro-
gram are making more than I and
have a higher title, even though
I've been there four times as
long. So it's a pretty blatant
situation.

KERSTIN: It's a difficult thing
because usually you don't even
know you're being discriminated
against. Usually you don't even
know there is a training program.
You're there a while, and Joe
Blow comes off the training.
"Training program? What's that?"
you think. And they keep the
salaries so secret you don't
realize you're getting so much
less; you don't know how much
the men or other women are mak-
ing.

Bank of America

CHANGE: Traditionally you're
not supposed to talk about it,
because there's something called
"loyalty to the company."
KERSTIN: Also, it's a "personal
matter" between you and your
boss--which keeps people from
finding out about inequities in
salaries.

KATIE: When the men come off
the training program, they come
to our department to learn our
jobs. And they're supposedly my
superiors, but I'm training
them. One day I was given work
that the men had completely
botched up. I was told, "Hey,
Katie, could you please do this
right--wouldn't want to hurt
their feelings...just give it
to the typist, and we'll send
it on, and they'll never know."
Well, I refused to do it. I
told him I wouldn't, and right
then I decided I was going to
do something about it. I went
on a crusade to find people,
and I found Barbara and Kerstin.
KERSTIN: Another thing is, the
men are trained at the bank,
whereas we have to take courses
on our own. What the men learn
in training is background ma-
terial which gives them the
ability to do any job. We don't
get this general background, so
we're pigeonholed into one par-
ticular task, and that's where
we're expected to stay--unless
by some stroke of luck or genius
we get out.

In March 1970, last year, I wrote
a letter to the president of the
bank. I told him the situation
was intolerable. He forwarded my
letter to a vice-president, who
called me in for a nice, pater-
nalistic chat. Basically what he
said was, "You're a lovely lady,
but don't worry your head about
things like this." (Cont'd on p. 6)

Sarah Taylor, Executive Board
member of AFSCME, Local 1695

Maids Fight
Dirt at U.C.

Led by Black working women, Local
1695 of the American Federation of
State, County & Municipal Employees,
AFSCME, is engaged in an ‘equal pay
for equal work' struggle with the
University of California, Berkeley.

65 dormitory maids and 15 janitors
are demanding equal pay with the
custodians and matrons who basically
perform the same kind of labor but
receive higher wages. After months
of negotiations, the University has
agreed to a ‘substantial’ pay in-
crease, but it is still not equal.

UC, the second largest employer in
the state, continues to lay off maids
and janitors seasonally, but they are
not eligible for unemployment (this
includes workers with 20 years of ser-
vice). AFSCME is demanding that the
maids and janitors receive full year-
round work with no reduction of staff.

AFSCME, a rank-and-file union run on
democratic principles, is now attempt-
ing to organize on the campus to gain
support to push through a contract
protecting all employees.

Since the University has consistently
reneged on its promises to employees,
CHANGE urges all women to take a
special interest in AFSCME's attempt
to secure the rights of this specific
group of working-class women.

President Nixon stated he would
prefer not to call his cabinet
members "secretaries" because
it makes them sound like women!!
