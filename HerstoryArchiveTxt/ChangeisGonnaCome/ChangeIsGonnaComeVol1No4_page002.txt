ALL

In the last few months, several new  
Women's groups have formed in the  
Bay Area. Three of these organi-  
zations (see below) supported and  
participated in the March 30 demon-  
strations in San Francisco, demand-  
ing that the Industrial Welfare  
Commission reopen hearings on  

“wage orders." This commission,  
composed of four men and one woman,  
is appointed by the governor and is  
responsible for issuing the wage  
orders which set maximum hours,  
minimum wages, and standards of  
working conditions for women and  
minors in most occupations other  
than government.

It was hoped that such a demon-  
stration followed by women talking  
about the need to raise the  
minimum wage, eliminate speedups  
and to provide childcare centers  
would induce the commission to be  
more responsive to women's needs  
as workers.

The effect of this show of soli-  
darity upon the Commission at  
least was impressionable enough  
that they delayed making a  
decision. Although they will  
require two more hearings --  
one in Fresno and one in L.A. --  
before deciding to reopen the  
wage orders, it is hoped they  
will be reopened and women  

will again have an opportunity  
to present their very legit-  
imate demands.

We should all make an effort  
to support these newly formed  
organizations in the Bay Area  
and anywhere else that women  
are coming together to make  
themselves heard.

ON THE JOB

The Committee to Extend Protec-  
tive Legislation is a coalition  
of working women who want to  
build the women's liberation  
movement by defending women  
workers and organizing around  
their special needs and inter-  
ests. As a major priority, they  

TOGETHER

are attempting to update, pre-  
serve, and strengthen the state  
laws governing wages, hours and  
working conditions for women and  
minors. The committee hopes to  

build a campaign around the follow-  
ing demands:  
1) Minimum wage of $3.00 per hr.  
2) 35 hr. week -- time and a half  
after 7 hrs. daily.  
3) Upgrade wages, hours and work-  
ing conditions for farm workers.  
4) Free childcare centers at com-  
pany expense.  
5) Protection for domestic workers.

Union WAGE (Union Women's Alliance  
to Guarantee Equality) was organized  
by women trade unionists. In addi-  
tion to supporting the Industrial  
Welfare Commission demonstration,  
WAGE has supported numerous women  
workers' strikes. WAGE is now con-  
sidering calling a women's demon-  
stration at San Francisco educational  
TV Station, KQED, demanding more  
programs on women and especially  
working women.

Some of the unions represented at  

the founding meeting were as fol-  

lows:  

1) American Federation of Teach-  
ers (AFT)  

2) Association of Federal, State,  
County and Municipal Employ-  
ees (AFSCME #1695)  

3) Office and Professional Em-  
ployees Union  

4) Communications Workers of  
America  

5) Amalgamated Clothing Workers  

6) Newspaper Guild  

7) Lithographers and Photograph-  
ers Union.  

WAGE's next meeting will be held  
on April 15 in the AFT Hall in  
Berkeley. The topic of discus-  
sion will be patterns of inequal-  

ity and discrimination for women  
workers and how to fight them.

All women are welcome. For fur-  
ther information contact Ann  
Draper, Amalgamated Clothing Work-  
ers, 250 Seventh St., San Francisco,  
Ca., telephone - 771-5397.

IN THE STREETS

Organized for April 24 is an ad  
hoc group of women organizing a  
women's contingent in the anti-war  
demonstrations called by the Nation-  
al Peace Action Coalition in San  
Francisco on April 24th.

This group is attempting to get  
women to march together at this  
demonstration to demand that the  
billions of dollars worth of re-  
sources being used to massacre  
people in Viet Nam, Laos and Cam-  
bodia be used to meet our needs as  
women: childcare centers, jobs,  
education and medical facilities.

Their next meeting will be April  
10 at 11 a.m. at the address be-  
low. All women who wish to par-  
ticipate in organizing this march  
should attend this meeting or con-  
tact this group at:
