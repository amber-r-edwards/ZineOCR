Emergency Loan Fund

by Debbie D’Andrea

On August 26, 1974, guidelines for
an Emergency Loan Fund (ELF)
at the Women’s Center were drawn
up. A committee of four utilized
donations which the Center had
received for previous newsletters,
donations specifically delineated
for a loan fund, and some petty
cash monies for the formation of
the ELF. The loan fund functions
specifically for women.

Susan Weldon, a member of ELF
indicated that it often is very
demeaning to go to a bank and ask
for a loan. One must expose all
financial obligations and explain
fully what the loan is to be used for.

As we are well aware, it is
difficult for women to obtain loans.
There are stigmas placed on single
and divorced women concerning
their ability to be secure in their
jobs and questioning whether or
not such a woman is to be
considered a good risk. Married
women are stigmatized by the
credit rating of their husbands. If a
man has a poor credit rating, his
wife’s credit rating is unduly
affected. A credit rating depends
also upon previous loans held. If
you are a woman and wish to
obtain a loan for the first time at a
bank, it may prove to be very
difficult. Some women find that
they have to buy something on time
in order to obtain a credit rating.

In light of these difficulties, the
Women’s Center Emergency Loan
Fund provides a service to women
in need. The funds we have

available are not extensive. As a

result, a maximum loan of $50 is
available. Susan said she hoped
our funds would grow so that we
could be more responsive to the
needs of those women with emer-
gencies that require more money.
The fund can only grow through
donations as it isn’t connected with
the university or any other funding
agency. This service represents
reaching out to other women. The
more donations we receive, the
more we can do for each other.

The guidelines that were set up
indicate a great deal of trust
among women. When a woman
comes to the Center for a loan, if
funds are available, she need only
indicate she has an emergency and
not justify her request with any
explanation. Women requesting
this money are urged to decide for
certain that their specific situation
is an emergency, because of our
limited funds.

Women who obtain a loan are
asked to repay it within a month’s
time. If at the end of a month that
is impossible, the borrower is
asked to come to the Center to re-
negotiate the time of repayment.
There is no interest charged for
any loans.

Women cannot be issued a
second loan if the first one is still
outstanding, again due to our
limited funds. An informal agree-
ment indicating the borrower’s
name, address, phone number,
date and amount borrowed, is
drawn up between the borrower
and a representative from ELF for
bookkeeping purposes. All women
are urged to donate a little money,

person’s unique facial structures.
Developing this point, Nina shared
her impressions of stewardesses
from two worlds, one Japanese and
the other Chinese. The first, care-
fully “made up,” concentrated on
generating an air of professionalism;
the other, neat, but unornamented,
succeeded in creating an
atmosphere of warmth and gen-
uineness.

TASSAJARA — ONCE REMOVED —

by Linda Jo

Home-baked bread is a luxury
that many people can’t afford be-
cause of time. Yeast breads take at
least three hours and some elbow
grease. Make a double recipe (4
loaves) or more and freeze them to
save time each week.

Take a large bowl and pour in 3
cups of warm water. Don’t make it
too hot to touch; otherwise, the
yeasties will get killed. Add in 1 T.
yeast. (Equivalents: 1 pkg dry
yeast equals 1 T. el molino bulk
yeast equals one-third cake yeast.)

Linda’s constant struggle to be
taken seriously at WHUS led her to
run for the position of Minority
Program Director this spring. Al-
though she lost, another unexpect-
ed gain for women was made. Di-
ane Kelsey became the first wom-
an to hold the position of Sports Di-
rector at the Station. (She was
elected by the Executive Board af-
ter the station manager found rea-
sons to disqualify her from the gen-
eral staff election, leaving no one
officially running for the position.)

Diane’s difficulties have already
begun with the refusal by men on
the sports staff to do work (al-
though none of them were suspended
like Linda), and the outgoing
Sports Director’s refusal to help
train her, traditionally his obliga-
tion to the person taking over his
position.

Linda wants eventually to see
women’s programming incorporated
into the station as a whole, although
at this point that’s politically
impossible. Her main goals now
are to “educate the general pub-
lic” and to build a women’s pro-
gramming department that won’t
die. She is responsible for the crea-
tion of the position of Women’s
News Director, filled by Mimi Ed-
monds, and for training several
women who will join the staff this
coming year. She asks anyone in-
terested in joining her department
to contact her at the station, and is
willing to train women inexperienced
in radio.

Linda needs our support. Letters
should be sent to WHUS Station
Manager Bob Markle, U-8, Uni-
versity of Connecticut, Storrs, Ct.

Let it sit for a few minutes after
dissolving.

Add some sweetener, from ½ to ¾ c. depending on your taste and atti-
tude towards sugar and honey. The
sweetening can be honey (a
taste is very heavy), corn syrup (a
light brown sweet syrup) or brown
sugar. White sugar should not be
used as it is a non-nutritive carbo-
hydrate.

Then add 1 c. powdered milk, ei-
ther instant or non-instant. Nutri-
tion-wise, non-instant has a higher
protein content and is less refined
but it is harder to mix and cook
with. Either do well in bread.

Now add 3½ to 4¼ c. flour. Many
substitutes can be made for this in-
gredient. Use 1 c. or more of rolled
oats, sesame seeds, soy flour, rye
flour or cornmeal. These varied
flours and grains provide a tasty
and nutritious loaf of bread. The
different combinations (such as
wheat and soy) will increase the
amount of protein available to you,
than if there was only wheat flour
used.

Blend all these ingredients to-
gether. Now add 1½ T. salt. For
people on low-salt diets, this can be
eliminated. Now ½ to ¾ c. oil and
then 3 to 4 c. flour. You can use
some unbleached white flour to
make the bread lighter. The oil
should be as polyunsaturated as
possible. Use sunflower oil, safflower oil, peanut oil. Avoid corn
oil, cottonseed oil and olive oil.

Mix all these ingredients with a
heavy spoon and your hands until it
begins to form a large ball that
sticks to itself. If it sticks to the
sides of the bowl too much, add
more flour. Take this ball and
place it on a floured board. Flour
your hands. Knead the bread with
a push-pull motion. Use the heel of
your hand to push and bring it back
with your fingers. Turn the bread
many times to get all the ingredi-
ents mixed in. If the bread is too
sticky, knead in more flour. The
wetter the bread is at this time, the
more chewy the loaf will be after
baking.

After kneading (5-10 min.), wash
out the bowl. Grease the bowl with
some oil and place the kneaded
bread in the bowl. Cover with a
warm, damp cloth. Put the bowl on
a warm spot (pilot light, radiator,
near the furnace). Let it double in
size (approximately one hour).

Again on a floured board. This
time, divide it into two or three
equal portions. (This recipe makes
2 large loaves or 3 small ones.)
Knead each loaf separately. The
more you knead bread, the lighter
it will be. Place each loaf in a
greased pan or baking dish and
once again let it rise till doubled.

Bake at 350 degrees for 30 to 45
min. The bread will be deep brown
on top and if you tap it with your
finger, it will sound hollow when
fully cooked. If you want a hard
crust, wash the top of the loaf with
water a few times during baking.
You can use an egg wash also be-
fore baking and put poppy, sesame,
or caraway seed on top.
Remove the bread from the pans
five minutes after baked.

SOLIDARITY

ment, requires cooperation be-
tween people with vastly different
goals and attitudes. This creates
innumerable problems. Sometimes
the difficulties outweigh the bene-
fits.

At UConn now, lesbians work
mostly with straight women, little
with gay men. We have in general
found straight women, here, recep-
tive to gay issues and gay men un-
receptive to feminism. We keep up
communication with the UConn
Gay Alliance and go in with the
men to speak to classes and run
workshops. We hope that commu-
nication will improve, that it will
become possible to form a real ali-
ance of gay people and feminists.
Meanwhile, we work in the wom-
en’s movement on gay issues, we
plan workshops and discussion
groups, and we are always avail-
able to talk to individuals or groups
about personal or political issues.
We make our presence visible and
vocal, to let our sisters, both gay
and straight, know that we are
here, and that we belong here.

Other slides showed men and
women sharing in child care. Day
care centers, attached to factories
where either parent works, 80-day
maternity leaves, and equal pay
for equal work are examples of
women’s gains under the changed
priorities of the Communist re-
gime.

Nina spoke with women civic
leaders and doctors. In China a
highly trained worker is encour-
aged to partake in a menial task.
When a doctor was asked if her
cleaning toilets was not a waste of
skill, she replied that she better un-
derstood the condition of the people
she served and hence was a better
doctor. The gains of women reflect
the liberation of all the Chinese
people from the confines defined
by Confucian-feudal ideology that
shackled them until 1949.

Nina warns against a tendency to
romanticize the present situation
in China and emphasizes, “the re-
volution is in full swing.” Men still
predominate in leadership posi-
tions and women still outnumber
men in “women’s” work, like em-
broidery and child care. “We must
view the situation in China today
from a historical perspective,”
Nina reiterates. If we judge how far
the Chinese people have already
carried themselves in 25 years and
the continuing efforts of the Chi-
nese government to reinforce their
struggle, we can hope to see excit-
ing advances in the future. The re-
volution of ideology in China today
is still a young and vital one.

Women In Crisis

Continued from page 1

Based on our collective
experience, we see that
services for women. Further we
recognize that a critical part of our
work involves the necessity for our
own consciousness raising. We all
entered the unit at different stages
of feminist awareness and with
varying degrees of commitment to
the struggle of women. At the
year’s end we embrace this as our
struggle too. We are, each in our
own way, dedicated to working
with other women using feminist
analyses, our bodies, our minds,
our hearts, and our collective
strength as our tools.

In our efforts to demystify our
work and our roles as social
workers, we recognize that we
suffer from the same sex-role
stereotyping, discriminations and
oppression as do the women we
serve. We recognize that there are
no individual solutions for our
oppression, that we must work
collectively.

We believe that all forms of
social work, work in communities,
in groups, with families, with
couples, with individuals, are
inherently political. For too long
social work has been an agent of
social control and a tool of our own
oppression.

We have worked hard to change
that and have worked to make our
involvement with other women a
liberating experience for them as
well as for ourselves.

There are those at the School of
Social Work who question the
“validity” of this training unit.
They look upon it askance, saying
that it is “non-traditional” and
question whether we have received
training “commensurate with
Master’s degree level education.”
We have received excellent
training and have been involved
with an invaluable personal
experience. We strongly support
the continuation of the Women in
Crisis Field Unit and urge other
women at the School of Social Work
to do the same.
