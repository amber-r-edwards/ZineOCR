SIMMONS: WOMEN'S SHOW

IN PRISON

by Debbie D’Andrea

Marie Hill, a 15-year-old Black
woman from North Carolina, was
arrested in 1968 for the murder of a
white grocery store owner in
Rocky Mt., North Carolina. Marie,
held for a week without being able
to contact her family or a lawyer,
was coerced into signing a confes-
sion which she later repudiated.
During the course of the trial, the
State could not prove that she was
present at the scene of the crime,
yet, an all-white jury found Marie
guilty and sentenced her to death.
When the U.S. Supreme Court
ruled the death penalty un-
constitutional, the court changed
her sentence to life in prison. She is
currently in Raleigh Women’s
Prison.

This is one of the many cases
that Louise Simmons spoke about
at the Women’s Center on April
20th. Ms. Simmons is a member of
the Ct. Defense Coalition, Ct.
Chapter of the National Alliance
Against Racist and Political
Repression. She spoke specifically

about several cases involving

women political prisoners, which
“are currently taking place. The
case is

true barbarism of racism and
sexism in this country. She has to
defend herself against rape and
against a court and judicial system
most oppressive for Black people.”

In August '74, Joann Little, a 20-
year-old Black woman, was raped
by a jailor armed with an ice pick.
Joann, in an attempt to defend
herself, grabbed the ice pick and in
a struggle, killed Clarence Alle-
good, the jailor. She ran away,
fearing she might be killed. North
Carolina has the only fugitive law

Classified:
Bias In Pay

by Debbie D’Andrea
The classified women’s struggle
began in the early ’70s with Classi-
fied Women’s participation in the
Commission on the Status of Wom-
en. This was the first time classi-
fied women had been included in a
group concerning itself with wom-
en’s issues. By the time of the for-
mation of Gail Shea’s advisory
council, the Women’s Council, se-
vere problems in the classified sys-
tem became apparent. A subcom-
mittee was formed and worked
with members of Affirmative Ac-
tion. This subcommittee talked
with classified women and did ex-
tensive statistical work showing
the injustices apparent in the pay
scales of the classified system. The
committee, under the direction of
Doloris Hilding, compiled a report
which appears in full, in the July
19th issue of the University Chron-
icle.
One of the injustices cited in the
report was the general lack of

left in the U.S. and under this law,
a fugitive can be shot on sight.
Joann Little negotiated a
surrender with protection. A
nationwide campaign was
launched for her bail, the largest
since that of Angela Davis. Joann
is now out on bail but is hiding be-
cause of the numerous threats on
her life. Due to the fact that several

Holding Up

of the Allegood family’s friends
were jurors at the Grand Jury
hearing, the trial may be dis-
missed. Joann Little and all
political prisoners need mass
support if the biased court system
in North Carolina is to be pre-
vented from harassing and im-
prisoning innocent people.

Half The Sky

by Laurel D’Aquilla

Nina Shapiro Pearl, anthropolo-
gist and member of US-China Peo-
ple’s Friendship Association, pre-
sented a talk and slide-show April
20 at the UConn Women’s Center
based on her recent trip to China.
The purpose of the organization
she represents, “building friend-
ship” between Chinese and US peo-
ple through education, is an ad-
vance towards dispelling incorrect
views of the People’s Republic,
legacies of 15 years of silence and
distortion of fact.

Nina illustrated the magnitude of
the struggle for women in China by
speaking of the “bitter past,” the
time prior to the 1949 Civil War,
when women suffered a special op-
pression based on sex as well as
sharing class oppression in the feu-
dal-imperialist structure with
men. Nina showed a picture of an
old woman with deformed feet,
victim of the widespread custom of
footbinding, a painful and handi-
capping experience for women to
conform to a standard of beauty.
Foot-binding and female infanti-
cide are symbols of the “bitter
past.”

The Chinese people are strug-
gling to replace a fragmenting
Confucian ideology, which has
advocated the subjugation of wom-
en, with the Communist ideology,
emphasizing the value of women,
embodied in the slogan, “Women
hold up half the sky.”

Nina showed examples of bill-
boards reinforcing this ideology.
Women were pictured driving
tractors, working on high tension
wires and studying Maoist thought.
We are reminded of the contrasting
ways in which women are used as
attention-getters on advertising
billboards in the US. Nina showed
examples of the affection publicly
shared by members of the same
sex, pointing out how the custom of
simple dress and hairstyle, with no
“distractions,” emphasized each

Cut

by Ellen Stone

All those who had listened for
Linda Smith’s “Women’s Pro-
gram” on WHUS at three o’clock
on Tuesday afternoon will now be
disappointed.

The baseball season has continu-
ously been deemed more impor-
tant than “women’s stuff” by the
powers-that-be at the station, and
several of Linda’s shows, including
a Women’s Week special, have
been pre-empted by sports events.
Last week, when Linda refused to
engineer the baseball game that
was to interrupt her show, she was
suspended from the airwaves until
May 15, when the program will re-
sume on a summer schedule as yet
unknown.

The suspension is the latest in a
long line of harassments which
show the lack of regard the station

Women In
Crisis

at the University of Connecticut School of Social
Work have participated in a new
field training unit “Women in
Crisis.” Designed to focus our
social work training on issues
pertaining to women, the training
unit was coordinated and super-
vised by Lynda Kahn, faculty
member of the School of Social
Work.

Our days have found us working
in the YWCA, Hartford’s Rape
Crisis Center, Planned Parenthood
Clinics, Youth Counseling Centers,
out-patient mental health clinics,
alcohol clinics, Women’s Centers,
high schools and day care centers.
Our work has brought us into
contact with women through
groups, individual counseling,
family counseling, community

places not only on Linda’s work,
but on women-oriented programming in general. Taped interviews
mysteriously erased, disturbances
in the studio during her show, and
failure of the WHUS staff to make
good on promises to cover events of
interest to women have been con-
tinual fare for Linda, the only an-
nouncer producing specifically
women’s programs. It’s a constant
hassle, and, at the overwhelmingly
male-dominated station, Linda
gets very little support for what
she does.

She produces a one-hour and a
two-and-a-half-hour program, the
preparation for which takes many
more hours than what we actually
hear.

The Women’s

program includes non-seen
music, information, and inter-
views with area and women
representatives of most of the
collectives at the Women’s Center
have been featured, as well as such
personalities as feminist musician
Margy Adam and poet Sonia San-
chez. Subjects discussed range

from the inadequacy of women’s
health care to women in Cuba to
literature and art. The interviews
are punctuated by the work of
women musicians as diverse as
Janis Ian, Meg Christian, and Alice
Coltrane.

organizing and program develop-
ment. We have become involved
with women of all ages, races,
incomes, and cultural
backgrounds.

In spite of these differences
between women, most of the
women we met expressed many of
the same concerns: the pain of
isolation, the feeling that her dis-
satisfactions and problems are
unique to only herself, the terrible
feeling of being out of control of her
life.

Gay-Straight Solidarity

by Eileen Berkun

Theoretically, there ought to be
absolute unity between gay men,
Lesbians, and straight feminists;
we are all fighting a common ene-
my; we are all demanding an end
to sexual oppression. But in fact,
although our long-range goals may
be the same, our immediate needs
are often vastly different.

Straight women often fail to see
lesbianism as a valid issue, fail to
see it as relevant to themselves.
Often they are hostile. Lesbianism
is too much of a challenge to exist-
ing values; it represents a demand
for more immediate and more
drastic change than they are ready
to think about.

Gay men, meanwhile, are not as
different from other men as one
might think. Very few men, gay or
straight, can make a real commit-
ment to feminism. While most men
in the gay movement are vaguely
aware that gay liberation and
women’s liberation are related,
they don’t always realize how very
basic sexual equality is to sexual
liberation. Consequently, most gay
men remain unable or unwilling to
see the extent and the power of
sexism in society or in themselves.

Lesbians, with our straight sis-
ters, are examining the role that
sexism plays in our society. We are
coming to understand that it is part
of the basic structure of our soci-
ety, an integral part of a system
that oppresses not only us, not only
blacks and third world peoples, but
also the majority of white, hetero-
sexual males.

I believe this kind of understand-
ing is necessary for real unity be-
tween feminists, homosexuals, and
other oppressed groups. But the
process of developing that con-
sciousness, of building a move-
