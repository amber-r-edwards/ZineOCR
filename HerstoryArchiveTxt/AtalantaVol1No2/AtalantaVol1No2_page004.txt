independent decision,  
women are to be truly free in all  
respects, we need to have a sense  
of ourselves as strong, independent  
individuals. If we can confront and  
conquer our fear of homosexuality,  
which is one of society’s most  
powerful mechanisms for making  
us conform, then we certainly  
should be able to accomplish all  
those other things they tell us  
women shouldn’t be able to do.  
Furthermore, having honestly  
looked at the reasons why we  
practice any given mode of sexual  
expression, we can then be a little  
more sure that whatever choice we  
do make, really is our own choice.  
None of us is free to be hetero-  
sexual until we are all free to be  
homosexual.
