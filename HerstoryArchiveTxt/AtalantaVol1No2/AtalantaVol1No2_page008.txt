Peer Counseling

by Sue Dzielinski and Laurel  
D’Aquilla

Peer counseling at the Women’s Center has been in existence for al-
most a year. In peer counselor Karen Winter’s words, “Peer
counseling is counseling which fo-
cuses on person to person, not pro-
fessional to person. It is a counsel-
or’s responsibility to focus on her
peer’s feelings, not to interject per-
ceptions and solutions.” In no way
does the peer counselor make any
decisions for the clients. The cli-
ents know what they want to do
with their life, therefore are the on-
ly ones capable of making lifestyle
choices.

The idea originally came from
Jan Bertram, a Change Agent—
Hartford counselor who wanted to
develop peer counseling programs
in Women’s Centers in the U.S., us-
ing the UConn Women’s Center as
a pilot project. Karen Winter and
10 other women were trained at
Change Agents and now form the
Peer Counseling Collective at the
UConn Women’s Center. The col-
lective hopes to begin a training
program for more women in Sep-
tember.

“The ‘gentle message’ of our cul-
ture tells us what we should and
shouldn’t do. It’s not good to feel.
Peer counseling is a break with the
culture,” Karen says. In this cul-
ture a person has two choices as to
what to do with feelings. One either
suppresses them or blows up. Nei-
ther way does one confront the
feelings. “What peer counseling
does is to give people space to feel
those feelings they have pushed
down for so long. It gives people
room to intelligently think about
what they want to do with those
feelings. Peer counseling is a way
of developing being in charge.
Once a person is in charge, she has
a sense of potency, of being able to
take control of her life and make
decisions.”

An integral part of peer counsel-
ing revolves around the concept of
co-counseling. Peer counselors
practice switching client and coun-
selor roles with each other in order
to obtain a clearer perspective on
themselves. “It’s easy to switch
roles because part of being a peer
counselor is concentrating on un-
derstanding where your client is
coming from. The counseling done

formation about the counseling

CONTINUING
EDUCATION
FOR WOMEN

by Sylvia White  
Since the early sixties more and
more women are returning to
college for a variety of reasons
having to do with their changing
roles and self-conceptions. The
University of Connecticut’s
Continuing Education for Women
program helps women map out a
plan for starting school again and
offers non-credit, skill-oriented
programs for women who do not
wish to pursue a degree.  
Counselor Marjorie Bennett
explains that many women coming
back to school from a primarily
home-centered situation have little
idea of what they want to do. With
the help of aptitude tests and the
woman’s assessment of her own
needs, CEW helps work out a credit
or non-credit program and find the
right school for the woman if
UConn doesn’t fit her needs.  
CEW holds a group program of
educational and career guidance,
as well as offering individual
counseling. The program includes
group discussion, testing, and
individual conferences. It is a
valuable source of support, for
often women returning to school
after years of identifying
themselves as housewives need to
boost their self-confidence. They
may feel isolated in an
environment of eighteen to twenty-
one year olds whose experiences
are very different from their own.  
This past year on campus, CEW
offered several programs open to
the Storrs community. These
included the “Brown Bag Raps,” a
series of informal lunchtime
discussions on various topics,
several films, workshops on
women and the law, video taping,
and female sexuality. Ideas which
will enable CEW to better serve the
campus and community are
always welcome. Interested
women may stop by CEW’s offices
on the second floor of the Women’s
Center, 27 Whitney Rd., call 486-
3440, or write to Elizabeth Roper,
coordinator, Continuing Ed-
ucation for Women, U-124, Storrs,
Ct.

Gymnast Speaks On Sports

by Susan Hudak

Recent legislation and court cas-
es relating to sex discrimination
are beginning to equalize varsity
sports opportunities for U.S. wom-
en athletes, said Mimi Murray, the
U.S. coach of the Women’s Gym-
nastic Team to the World Games in
Moscow, 1974. She added if Title IX is
signed, “it will provide more op-
portunities in sports.” She was the
first speaker on the opening day of
Women’s Week at UConn.

Title IX of the 1972 Education
Amendment prohibits any federally
funded educational institution
from discriminating against stu-
dents or workers on the basis of
sex. Now, the Department of
Health, Education and Welfare
(HEW) is preparing guidelines for
adoption of this law, including spe-
cific definitions of what constitutes
discrimination. Recent guidelines
state that varsity sports opportuni-
ties in a co-ed institution may not
be limited to only male students or
only female students.

However, if the institution
provides separate opportunities
for women and men to partici-
pate in comparable competitive
athletics with parallel levels of
competition, then neither will have
access to the other’s team.

Mimi Murray mentioned that
equal opportunities also includes
“necessary equipment such as
paid officials and practice uni-
forms” for women.

She attributes the lack of support
for women in sports not to men but
to women themselves. At Spring-
field College, where Murray taught
for six years, the male faculty
gives more support to women’s
athletics than the women’s coaches
do, she said.

Speaking about her recent trip to
Moscow with the U.S. team in Aug-
ust ’74 she said, “Our U.S. athletes
are mere amateurs competing
against Russian professionals.”  
Russian athletes are chosen at age
five, and it’s their job to train to
win. “Soviets use sports as propa-
ganda for politics,” she added. Ac-
cording to Murray, for the U.S. to
reach professional standards, “We
will have to change our system un-
less we subsidize athletics.”

Notes From A Recent Dream *

I am sitting on the wall —

around the graveyard  
reading poems  
to the dead.

Suddenly, from the woods

a woman in colonial dress

carrying flowers

(the grey skirt rustling, the apron

like ice floating  
on a grey river...)

She kneels and places them

before three tiny  
markers

lichen-mottled, weather-worn

It is growing  
closer  
to winter

“What would happen if  
one woman told the truth about her life? “  
I read. “The world  
would split open.”
