_ Discrimination Bill Guidance  
Fails To Pass  

For the third straight year, a  
proposed bill in the Connecticut  
Legislature which would have  
prohibited discrimination against  
homosexuals, failed to pass. The bill  
would have banned most forms of  
discrimination on the basis of sexual  
orientation in the same manner that  
Connecticut has legislatively banned  
discrimination based on race, color,  
creed, and sex. The major areas where  
the bill would have prohibited  
discrimination are in employment and  
in housing.  

The following article by Christine  
Patee previously appeared in the  
Connecticut N.O.W. Newsletter (No. 6,  
Feb. 1975), and, although it was  
written before the proposed bill failed  
to pass, the article discusses the  
primary issues involved in the subject  
of sexual orientation and is reprinted  
in part here because of its continuing  
relevance.  

In 1969, Connecticut’s Revised  
Penal Code decriminalized the act  
of lovemaking between two people  
of the same sex. In 1975, Connect-  

icut had the chance to become  
the first state to prohibit dis-  
crimination against homosexuals.  
Considering the tremendous taboos  
Judeo-Christian culture has placed  
on homosexuality, this is in-  
credible progress. Through the  
profound effect it has had on all  
kinds of societal mores, the  
Women’s Movement has been a  
factor in changing attitudes about  
homosexuality too.  

Within the Women’s Movement  
however, lesbianism has always  
been a particularly difficult issue.  
After a good deal of screaming on  
both sides, everyone’s anger and  
defensiveness seem to be  
subsiding, but lesbians are still not  
integrated into the Movement in a  
comfortable way. There are a few  

openly lesbian women who are often  
viewed as objects or symbols  
instead of as real people. There are  
many more lesbians whose sexual  

orientation is kept a close secret  
for job or family reasons. The  
response of women in general has  
been a vast silence. Some women  
never think about lesbianism at all,  
others try very hard not to think  
about it, and some of the most well-  
meaning women think they are  
doing gay people a favor by  
ignoring their sexual orientation.  

Besides being painful to lesbians,  
who are made to feel as if they  
don’t exist, the effect of this  
conspiracy of silence has been to  
make the subject of lesbianism  
very difficult to bring up casually  
in the ordinary course of conver-  
sation. Before we get to the best of  
all possible worlds, where one's  
sexual orientation really won't  
make any difference, we have to  
confront the issue head-on, facing  
both personal fears and political  
realities.  

The political reality is that  
homosexuals face a very real  
danger of losing their jobs if their  

sexual orientation becomes known.  
Two people of the same sex may  
not be able to get an apartment  
together. In order to prevent, or at  
least reduce, these problems, a bill  
was introduced in the state  
legislature this session and for the  
past two years, to prohibit discrim-  
ination on the basis of sexual  
orientation.  

In contrast to other minority  
groups, where color or accent  
clearly identify one’s status,  
homosexuals don’t look or act  
differently from anybody else.  
Most homosexuals take great care  
not to be so identified, and passage  
of this legislation will do a great  
deal to remove the constant fear of  
exposure experienced by the 10  
percent of our population that  
Kinsey estimates is homosexual.  

Not all societies make such  
distinctions among people on the  
basis of their sexual behavior. In  
Patterns of Sexual Behavior, Ford  
and Beach found evidence of  
homosexuality in virtually every  
culture and in all higher animals  
studied. In about half the cultures,  
homosexuality was perfectly  
acceptable behavior. In the other  
half, the main effect of strong  
societal disapproval was to  
increase the number of individuals  
who were exclusively homosexual.  

In a culture such as ours, where  
sanctions against lesbians and  
male homosexuals are very strict,  
even to think of the possibility of a  
sexual relationship with another  
woman is one of the most  
liberating decisions a woman can  
make. This is definitely not to say  
that all women should be lesbians.  
How absurd to suggest that the  
result of freeing ourselves from  
one stereotype should be to put us  
right into another one. And this is  
also not to say that you should go  
out and find a lesbian to sleep with,  
since that would be one more kind  
of stereotype. It is more kindly to say that every  
woman should give some thought  
to her personal relationship to the  
issue.  

How do we know that our current  
sexual preference is really based on  
a free choice? At present, due to  
legal actions and social  
disapproval, we are only allowed to  
be heterosexual, and to have only  
one choice is to have no free choice.  
Therefore, each woman must look  
at herself and consider alternative  
possibilities. Such introspection  
may result in more lesbian  
behavior, but it is very unlikely  
that we will become a society of  
lesbians (or homosexuals). What  
will happen is that we will all be a  
little freer to love anyone, instead  
of being restricted as we are now to  
only 50 percent of humanity.  

Taking seriously the possibility  
of loving and making love with a  
person of one’s own sex is a strong,

Project  

The Sex Equality in Guidance  
Opportunities (SEGO) Project  
represents a national coordinated  
effort, funded on a contract to the  
American Personnel and Guidance  
Association by the U.S. Office of  
Education, to help elementary and  
secondary school counselors and  
related educational personnel to  
recognize and change the  
detrimental and limiting effects of  
sex role stereotyping which  
prevent children from developing  
and utilizing their full capabilities.  

Fifty-one counselors, the State  
Trainers of the SEGO Project, (one  
from each state and the District of  
Columbia) were selected and  
brought to Washington, D.C., for  
an intensive four-day training

The SEGO Project is conducting a  
workshop in sex fair guidance  
practices and attitudes. The Con-  
necticut State Trainer is Dr. Mar-  
guerite Hall Pengel of the Uni-  
versity Counseling Center,  
University of Hartford. Among the  
topics included in the training  
workshop were the implications of  
Title IX which forbids sex  
discrimination in educational insti-  
tutions, guidelines for sex fair  
interest measurement, research on  
sex roles, assertiveness training,  
aspects of the Women’s Movement,  
non-traditional counseling for boys  
and men, the double stereotyping  
of minority girls and women,  
values clarification, and the  
counselor role as consultant to  
other educational personnel.  

The ripple effect of the training  
project is being carried out by the  
State Trainers who, under the  
Project’s direction and funding, go  
back to their own state to conduct  
an average of five local workshops  
around the state for elementary  
and secondary school counselors  
and related educational personnel.  
These local workshops offer  
information on sex bias in regard  
to educational practices and the  
educational environment. Five  
workshops were offered in various  
locations in Connecticut.  

The Project has developed a  
multi-media kit containing nearly  
100 pieces of printed material on  
subjects related to the purposes of  
the Project as well as the filmstrip,  
A Chance to Choose, produced for  
the Project. The kit materials are  
displayed and the filmstrip is  
shown at every local workshop.  

The final report of the SEGO  
Project, including a compendium  
listing of all materials developed  
for the multi-media kit, will be  
published for wide dissemination.  

For more information on the  
Project call Dr. Pengel at the U. of  
Hartford, 243-4483.

Our Courts Continued from page 1  

the two on educational grounds is  
self-serving: if the female is not to  
be supported so long as the male,  
she hardly can be expected to  
attend school as long as he does,  
and bringing her education to an  
end earlier coincides with the role-  
typing society has long imposed.  

Whether the Court will continue  
to strike down statutes with sex  
classifications may be noticeable.  
The Court presently has two cases  
before it involving, in some manner,  
statutes with sex classifications—  
one statute excusing women from  
jury duty on a different basis than  
men, and the second case involving  
a state requirement that female  
employees receive premium  
overtime pay. Interestingly, both  
cases involve statutes that give  
preferences to women.  

In another case, the Supreme  
Court held a Social Security Act  
provision which distinguished  
between widows and widowers  
violated the equal protection  
provisions of the U.S. Constitution.  
In its distinction (that a male  
worker’s earnings are more  
important), while “not entirely  
without empirical support... cannot  
suffice to justify the denigration of  
the efforts of women who do work  
and whose earnings contribute  
significantly to their families’  
support.”  

In decisions by other courts  
around the country a federal court  
of appeals found that a little league  
baseball team’s use of city  
facilities was so extensive that the  
league’s refusal to allow girls to  
participate was “state action” and  
consequently illegal.  

Many of the recent sex  
discrimination cases have involved  
employment practices and some of  
these have centered on whether the  
exclusion of pregnancy-related  
disabilities from sickness and disa-  
bility benefits is valid. Two lower  
federal courts have ruled that last  
year’s U.S. Supreme Court’s  
decision in Geduldig v. Aiello did  
not invalidate the sex  
discrimination provision of Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act and  
the guidelines issued pursuant to  
the Act by the Equal Employment  
Opportunity Commission (EEOC)  
which require employers to treat  
pregnancy-related disabilities on  
the same terms and conditions as  
other temporary disabilities. The  
Geduldig decision had upheld  
California’s exclusion of preg-  
nancy-related disabilities from its  
mandatory created disability  
insurance plan. These lower court  
decisions are attempts at  
clarification and interpretation of  
the Supreme Court ruling in  
Geduldig and would, if not  
overturned, have a substantial  
impact upon the practices of many  
employers.  

In another sex discrimination  
case, a court upheld an employer's  
hair-length regulation applying  
only to men on the grounds that  
there was no showing that the  
regulation was used to hinder men  
from getting, enjoying, or keeping  
jobs. In its decision the court noted  
that men do “not need the broad  
protection accorded women to be  
treated equally under the law.”  

In an area of great concern today —  
layoffs during the recession —  
there have been two developments.  
First, the EEOC delayed its  
decision on layoff guidelines which  
would have required employers  
expecting layoffs to avoid firing a  
disproportionate number of women  
and minorities by using procedures  
such as work sharing, elimination  
of overtime, and reduced hours. In  
the second development, the U.S.  
Supreme Court has agreed to hear  
a case this fall on whether black  
victims of racial hiring practices  
are entitled to retroactive seniority  
credit. The outcome of the case  
could have a substantial impact  
upon arguments being made by  
females and minorities regarding  
the disproportionate layoffs of such  
groups which occur because of a  
combination of the effect of the  
seniority system and past  
discriminatory employment practices.
