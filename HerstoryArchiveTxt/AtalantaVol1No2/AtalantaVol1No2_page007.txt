Women’s Studies

by Sylvia White and Laurel  
D’Aguilla  

From a smattering of liberal arts  
courses existing in such areas as  
Sociology and English, UCONN is  
building a Women’s Studies  
program. The need for the  
program is implicit in the nature of  
traditional academia at UCONN,  
designed to highlight the  
functioning of male dominated  
institutions in the most areas of  
study. Women’s Studies exists in  
recognition of the struggles of  
women — to achieve in their fields  
and to fight sexism.  

Joan Geeter, Acting Director of  
Women’s Studies, is especially  
enthusiastic about a new  
interdepartmental course, Intro. to  
Women’s Studies. The course will  
deal with women authors, the  
economic, legal and political  
problems of women, female  
psychology, sexuality and much  
more. The scope is broad.  

CLASSIFIED  

Continued from page 1  
courses offered. There also exists a  
booklet entitled, “Employee Ori-  
entation,” which is not widespread  
among classified workers. The re-  
port finds Personnel Services Divi-  
sion at fault for not disseminating  
information to classified workers  
on their rights, privileges and pro-  
grams.  

Programs at Eastern Connecti-  
cut, Southern Connecticut, Central  
Connecticut, and Western Con-  
necticut State Colleges allow classi-  
fied workers to take two tuition  
free courses each semester and  
one during the summer. At UConn  
there exists a privilege to the fac-  
ulty, for their children, under the  
New England Regional Student  
Program, to attend the University  
of Massachusetts, the University of  
Rhode Island, the University of  
Maine, or the University of New  
Hampshire at in-state fees. Classi-  
fied employees at UConn, having  
financial resources considered  
smaller than those of the faculty,  
want the same privileges for their  
children. Classified workers at  
UConn don’t even have the privi-  
lege of tuition-free courses similar  
to those of classified workers at the  
State Colleges.  

The major criticism cited by the  
report dealt with examinations,  
upgradings, and pay scales. The  
report criticizes examinations,  
which professionals do not have to  
take, but which are mandatory for  
classified workers. “A Classified  
person, in what is called a ‘compe-  
titive position,’ has to pass a state  
exam to be hired. Upgrading also  
requires an examination. The com-  
plicated system of state examina-  
tion boggles the test-shy, incenses  
and discourages the competent  
employee who is tested for skills he  
or she doesn’t use or need in his or  
her job... If an employee passes an  
examination for upgrading her or  
his position, and there is no open-  
ing available at that level, she or  
he must take the exam again in six  
months.”  

“Discrimination is suggested  
when Clerk, Typist, and Steno clas-  
sifications have not been upgraded  
since 1970 and other employees in  
pay groups 2-8 were upgraded in  

illustrating the diverse fields that  
Women’s Studies incorporates.  

One problem with setting up  
Women’s Studies courses is the  
budget, though Joan is hopeful that  
the University will honor its  
commitment to increased  
offerings in the fall. Some proposed  
courses are going through while  
others depend on the budget and  
the availability of female  
professors. Joan commented that  
many departments have only a few  
female professors and they have  
heavy workloads. “The next step  
belongs to the students,” the  
director said. The life of the  
program depends on positive  
student support.  

It is important that the program  
continue to develop, especially  
now, in times of economic crisis.  
Women’s Studies reinforces a long  
neglected view of women as  
dynamic, productive people. It  
helps us to define who we are.  

STRUGGLE  

September, 1973. Thomas C. Lyon,  
president of the Connecticut State  
Employment Association, states  
that:  

“43 percent of American women  
over the age of 16 work full-time  
outside of the home, and 70 percent  
of women workers have to work  
because they are single, widowed,  
divorced, or married to a man who  
earns less than $7,000 a year.”  

The average clerical employee  
of the State of Connecticut earns  
$5,970-$7,152. We found these fig-  
ures revealing, discouraging, dis-  
criminatory, and we urge upgrad-  
ing the pay scale.”  

The report also commented on  
the need to increase medical cov-  
erage for dental and maternity  
care and to clarify maternity  
leave. The University’s Maternity  

Leave Policy needs to be restated  

to bring it into conformance with  

the Connecticut Public Act 73-647  

passed October 1973 which states  
that:  

“No private or public employer  
can legally terminate a woman’s  
employment because of pregnan-  
cy, refuse to grant her a reason-  
able leave of absence for the tem-  
porary disability resulting from  
her pregnancy or deny her any  
compensation and benefits which  
she has accrued in her employ-  
ment. Any leave of absence which  
is forced upon a pregnant woman  
by her employer invades the wom-  
an’s right to privacy, her right to  
bear children and her right to pur-  
sue a career. A decision on when a  
pregnant woman should temporar-  
ily stop work is best left to the  
judgment of the woman and her  
doctor.  

A woman, upon signing her in-  
tent to return to work after child-  
birth, must be guaranteed rein-  
statement to her original job or to  

an equivalent position with the  

equivalent pay and accumulated  
seniority, retirement, fringe bene-  
fits, and other service credits. The  
failure of the employer to include  
weekly benefits for childbirth in  
the company’s disability insurance  
policies constitutes sex discrimi-  
nation. Labor unions, employment  
agencies, private governmental  
employers must abide by these  

guidelines. The incidents  
accrue whether or not a  
pregnant woman is married or to the  
“mildness of the KKK.

built in N. Carolina with funds pro-  
vided by the Federal Government.

Some other problems of Class-  
ified Women were indicated to me  
by Toni Moran, a member of the  
Women’s Council. She commented  
that the salaries of classified work-  
ers are extremely low; some get  
stuck in their pay class and can’t  
advance or get their pay scales up-  
graded. Definition of the job and  
pay for that job are contingent  
upon the employee’s superior. Two  
secretaries can do identical work  
but be paid very differently if their  
superiors have different status or  

responsibilities. One cannot progress  
in the classified system without taking  
exams, many of which are unrelat-  
ed to the job being tested for. Re-  
view of a certain individual’s job  
and pay raise recommendations  
come from the Personnel Division  
of Hartford and not from the work-  
er’s superior who is more familiar  
with his or her employee’s respon-  
sibilities and abilities. Toni Moran  
has urged classified women to  
come to the meetings at the Wom-  
en’s Center and find out their  
rights and privileges.  

mentally ready, as if aware of her  
final destiny. From an early age  
she learned to use firearms, to ride  
horses, to keep her body fit by  
training as a gymnast. Her  
emotional strength and intellectual  
capacity, her joy and generosity,  
were always available to those who  
in a given moment would need her.  
Tania was always prepared to  
sacrifice to accomplish a mission,  
to teach, to translate, to shoot. The  
first stages of her visit to Cuba  
were a constant sharing of her  
knowledge and strength. Later  
she realized that she could be more  
effective channeling her interests  
to those areas where she was most  
proficient. She wrote: “A  
revolutionary must work where  
she is needed most. This  
understanding prevents me from  
using my time for purely personal  
matters.”  

This awareness, personal and  
political, is what led Tania to  
become a modern revolutionary  
spy, traveling from country to  
country, changing identities and  
preparing the details for the  
arrival of Che Guevara and his  
companions in Bolivia.

behavior modification of prisoners.  
A prisoner can volunteer for this  
program with the promise of  
parole. The prisoners are put on an  
absolute deprivation schedule and  
there is token reinforcement for  
“appropriate” behavior. Drugs,  
electric-shock treatments will also  
be used. There is also a method  
under consideration in which the  
individual is induced with the  
feeling of near death and slowly  
begins to assimilate “proper”  
behavior patterns. Clockwork  
Orange, only for real this time.  

Louise Simmons has urged us to  
write letters and circulate petitions  
to our congresspeople demanding  
that these cases be thoroughly  
scrutinized and that the charges be  
dropped. All those who want any  
information are urged to contact  
NATIONAL ALLIANCE AGAINST  
RACIST AND POLITICAL RE-  
PRESSION, 150 Fifth Avenue,  
Room 804, New York, N.Y. 10011.  

The NAACP in Boston is  
organizing a demonstration  
against racism on May 17. On May  
31 there will be a march on Wash-  
ington to free political prisoners.  
Those interested in either trip can  
contact CT. DEFENSE COALI-  
TION, Box 17222, Bishops Ctn, W.  
Hartford, CT 06117 for information  
about transportation.  

These injustices will go  
unchecked without mass support!  
As long as violations such as these  
occur, none of us are free—our  
rights to organize, protest and to  
dissent are at stake.  

In Tania, we can observe the  
case of a complete revolutionary,  
capable of transcending the  
personal, integrating  
revolutionary theory and practice.  
Inti Peredo, who fought with Tania  
in Bolivia, wrote about her: “Tania  
is the example for women of the  
world ... On our continent, where  
there are still many feudal  
reminiscences about women,  
Tania was able to break away from  
limitations. She died heroically for  
the freedom of Latin America, but  
she will live in the example of what  
a woman is capable of doing when  
she is a truly courageous  
revolutionary.”  

Tania’s body, riddled with  
bullets, was found one day floating  
in a river. She had fulfilled her  
wish to be “where the struggle is  
most intense.”  

I wonder if she encountered  
death with one of those Argentine  
folkloric songs she used to sing, or  
with a quote from Lenin, or a last  
thought for her comrades or the  
struggle that had to continue.  

Tania is an ideal for those who  
still have hopes, who struggle  
against oppression of all kinds.  
From Tania the woman, the  
intellectual, and the revolutionary,  
we can learn many lessons. The  
most important is the awareness of  
a rigid personal discipline, a total  
commitment to revolutionary  
struggle.
