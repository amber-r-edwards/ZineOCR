Child Care  
In Connecticut Welcome  

by Debra Haffner  

The state of Connecticut began to  
make a commitment to child care  
in 1967. At that time the state for-  
malized its responsibility for child  
care in developing sections 19-43 of  
the General Statutes which provid-  
ed for the licensing of child care  
centers and the establishment of  
the Child Day Care Council. The  
Council was assigned the task of  
making recommendations on the  
licensing, operation, programs,  
administration, and staff qualifi-  
cations of child care centers. The  
Council’s first guidelines were  
published in 1970.  

In 1967 there were 567 licensed  
child care centers. As of January 1,  
1975 there were 825 licensed cen-  
ters with an aggregate enrollment  
of almost 33,000 children (26,000  
children participating in half-day  
programs and 7,000 in full day pro-  
grams). Only 148 of these centers  
were supported by either state or  
federal funds.  

The 1970 census found that there  
are 55,000 working women in Con-  
necticut with pre-school age chil-  
dren. Another 10,000 women with  
children under six years old are the  
heads of families and are not in the  
labor force. There are an addition-  
al 56,000 women with pre-school  
age children who do not work and  
whose husbands earn below the  
median income. Clearly the needs  
of Connecticut women for child  
care services are not being met.  
The Permanent Commission on the  
Status of Women has estimated  
that there are 147,000 women who  
need or could take advantage of  
child care while only approximate-  
ly 7,000 licensed full day spaces ex-  
ist at present.  

During the last session of the  
General Assembly, two public acts  
concerning child care were passed.  
One act (PA 289) permits the state  
financial assistance for the devel-  
opment of child day care and  
neighborhood facilities. The sec-  
ond act (PA 206) allows the De-  
partment of Community Affairs to  
contract with private day care cen-  
ters for services for disadvantaged  
children, provided the cost per  
child is the same as in state-funded  
centers.  

The Human Services Committee  
of the General Assembly, chaired  
by Representative Irving Stolberg  
and Senator Betty Hudson, raised  
several bills this session concern-  
ing child care. House Bill 7452  
which would relax certain child  
care regulations which presently  
require licensing of non-profit par-  
ent-controlled cooperative child  
care arrangements was given little  
chance of passage. Therefore, Sen-  
ate Bill 1655 was drafted. It would  
establish an office of Child Day  
Care within the Office of Commu-  
nity Affairs and mandates that the  
Office of Child Day Care encourage  
parent cooperatives, as well as  
compile an inventory of existing  
child day care centers; seek fund-  
ing sources, and develop a plan to  
coordinate existing and future  
child daycare services.  

The existing General Statutes  
exempt “informal cooperative ar-  
rangements among neighbors or  
relatives in their own homes” from  
fulfilling the requirements while  
not allowing the same for formal-  
ized parent-controlled centers.  
“Informal arrangements” are us-  
ually more than babysitting ser-  
vices, yet parents willing to for-  
malize their commitments to their  
children are penalized by health  
and fire restrictions.  

The major opponents of the bill  
felt a relaxing of the restrictions  
would endanger children’s lives.  
However, the bill specified that the  
buildings used for such centers  
comply with the fire code for state  
occupancies and state basic build-  
ing codes. “It is unrealistic to fear  
that parents controlling a center  
would allow their own children to  
be placed in a situation where their  
safety would be in jeopardy,” Re-  
presentative Stolberg stated. “We  
must encourage the development  
of situations in which parents may  
work collectively to provide child  
care.”  

The demands for child care will  
not be met completely in the im-  
mediate future. As the fiscal crisis  
becomes more imminent in Con-  
necticut, it is unlikely that state-  
wide funding of centers will occur.  
Yet, we must continue to assert de-  
mands for societal responsibility in  
providing care for our children.

Connecticut NOW fund raiser  
April 28. Discussing personal  
congruence, Ms. Carbine said  
women are beginning to cut  
through barriers which have  
prevented their finding out who  
they really are.

On April 10, 1975, the Senate  
voted to table the Bartlett Amend-  
ment which would have prevented  
women from seeking Medicaid-  
financed legal abortion services.  
The vote was 54 to 36. Both Senator  
Ribicoff and Senator Weicker  
voted to table the amendment. In  
addition to expressing an opinion to  
your legislators prior to a vote, it is  
also important to express opinions  
on their votes. Thank them when  
you agree with their vote.

Women  

by Judy Dunne  

In February Everywoman’s  
Center, located at the Hartford  
Region YWCA, 135 Broad Street,  
formally opened its doors,  
primarily through the efforts of  
Patricia Schwartz of the YWCA  
Group Program Department. The  
Center has been open to all women  
every Monday from 10 a.m. to 1  
p.m. and 6:30 p.m. to 9:30 p.m.  

Women with a variety of back-  
grounds, lifestyles, and interests  
have come to Everywoman’s  
Center since its opening. These  
women share many common  
concerns and frustrations,  
regardless of the extent of each  
woman’s commitment to the  
women’s movement. Every-  
woman’s Center provides an  
opportunity for women to meet  
informally and talk with other  
women. The casual, unstructured  
atmosphere is inviting and un-  
threatening to a wide range of  
people.  

Many women come to the Center  
in search of specific information  
and direction. An extensive library  
of books, periodicals, and other  
literature of interest to women is  
located at the Center, as well as a  
resource file of local services for  
women and their families.  
Volunteers are constantly involved  
in bringing these files up to date.  

A recent development of the  
Center has been the addition of  
specialized vocational and career  
services for women. A major facet  
of this activity is career counseling  
for adult women seeking first-time  
employment, re-entry to the job  
market, a job change, or simply  
assistance in exploring interests,  
options, goals, and priorities.  
Appointments may be made for  
private one-hour sessions with  
Mary Jane Atkins, M.Ed., by  
calling 525-1163, extension 266.  
Counseling sessions are  
Monday and Wednesday, 6:00 to  
9:00 p.m. Daytime hours may also  
be arranged. One-hour sessions  
cost $8 for Y members, and $10 for  
non-members. The Strong-Camp-  
bell Interest Inventory Test is ad-  
ministered for an additional $10 to  
women seeking to determine their  
areas of interest. Everywoman’s  
Center does not operate as a job  
bank, but staffers hope that the re-  
source file and counseling services  
available can be of significant im-  
portance to women in realizing  
career aspirations.  

Since its opening three months  
ago, Everywoman’s Center has be-  
come many things to many  
women.  

The Past  
Recovered  

Ernestine Kettler is 77 years old.  
In 1917 she picketed the White  
House as part of the battle for  
woman's suffrage.  

Ms. Kettler played a significant  
part in the history of women, a  
history that has been too often  
ignored and unrecorded.  

In an effort to preserve and  
recording hundreds of hours of oral  
history interviews with women like  
Ernestine Kettler, women ranging  
in age from their seventies to over  
100 years old.  

These interviews, the voices of  
women describing history as they  
lived it, is creating a new body of  
knowledge. In these diving histories,  
experiences erase past histories.

Report From Britain  

Woman Heads  
Political Party  

by Nancy Fernandez  

On February 11, Margaret  
Thatcher surprised all the political  
observers in Britain by decisively  
winning the position of head of the  
Conservative Party. In an election  
contest with four male opponents,  
Thatcher won by seven more votes  
than the necessary 139. William  
Whitelaw, the favorite in the race  
(the second in a complicated  
election process), came in a poor  
second, receiving 79 votes to  
Thatcher’s 146.  

Thatcher, aged 49, is the first  
woman in Britain (and in Europe)  
to lead a national political party. In  
her first fight for the leadership on  
February 6, she defeated former  
Prime Minister Edward Heath in  
his bid to continue his 10-year  
leadership of the Tories.  
Thatcher’s defeat of Heath took  
everyone in Britain by surprise,  
since a victory for a woman in the  
male-dominated world of West-  
minster was “a speculative step  
taken against all the evidence of  
past political tradition,” according  
to The Guardian newspaper.  
The press had not taken her  
seriously as a real contender, in  
fact, until her defeat of Heath.  
(Heath subsequently withdrew  
from the race.)  

Mrs. Thatcher is generally  
described by the British press in  
anything but glowing terms. The  
Guardian called her “the new  
lioness of Conservatism,” a  
“queen-like figure in black  
taffeta... with waxwork-like  
composure,” and “decidedly  
cool.” Her election meant that the  
Conservative Party had “shut its  
eyes, pinched its nose and jumped  
into the deep end of the pool.”  
The day after Thatcher’s  
election, the much-respected  
liberal Guardian said “she is no  
Golda Meir or Indira Gandhi,” but  
gave her credit as a formidable  
politician, calling her “ambitious  
as well as intelligent. She wants to  
be Prime Minister, not just Leader  
of the Opposition.”  

The European edition of Time  
(Feb. 10) called Margaret  
Thatcher “this busybody lady with  
a carefully acquired upper-class  
accent... the classic variety of Tory  
clubwoman.” But a look at  
Thatcher’s background belies this  
typical suburban housewife image.  
She was born in Lincolnshire (a  
northern industrialized county of  
England) and earned a scholarship  
to a private girls’ school at age 11  
and later one to Oxford, where she  
earned an arts degree. She took a  
second degree in research  
chemistry and worked in that field  
while attending law school and  
running for Parliament at age 23.  
She has represented a London  
suburb in the House of Commons  
for 15 years and is a tax law expert.  

Margaret Thatcher first gained  
national prominence as Prime  
Minister Edward Heath’s  
Education Minister, a post she held  
for four years. She has attracted  
support of right-wing conservatives  
by espousing the Tory ideals of  
private enterprise, private  
property, and freedom from  
government intervention into  
economic affairs. As Education  
Minister she earned notoriety by  
ending the government’s free milk  
program in public schools in favor  
of an expanded building program.  
However, she also pushed the first  
10-year educational plan through  
the treasury — a plan liberals have  
called “a sensible document  
almost Socialist in its approach.”  

Margaret Thatcher seems  
determined to be seen as a person  
who is a politician rather than as a  
“woman politician.” When asked if  
her election was a victory for  
Women’s Lib or for Margaret  
Thatcher, she replied: “Neither —  
it’s a victory for someone in  
politics.” When the press asked if  
she was aware of skepticism sur-  
rounding the appointment of a  
woman to the job of chief Tory, she  
simply said: “Give me a chance.”

former editor of ALERT, is in  
England this year. ALERT is  
pleased to have her as a foreign  
correspondent and to have this  
report on the political scene.)  

To The Editor  

To the Editor:  

Congratulations on your  
excellent eight-page February  
edition.  

I am particularly pleased by the  
news reporting and letter writing  
which give the names of persons in  
state agencies and in the business  
sector who discriminate against  
women. It is time that the protec-  
tive mantle of anonymity be  
removed from these individuals.  

Many thanks for this valuable  
service.  
Sincerely,  
Anne Darrow
